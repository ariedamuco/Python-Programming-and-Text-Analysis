 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the American people have a growing concern over encroachments on personal privacy. It seems that everywhere we turn, new technologies, new communications media, and new business services created with the best of intentions and highest of expectations also pose a threat to our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, to live, work and think without having giant corporations or government looking over our shoulders, or peeking through our keyholes. 
The current national media obsession with the Monica Lewinsky scandal has focused attention on abuses of power by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. I have been a prosecutor, and I am intimately familiar with the enormous power prosecutors wield. This power is generally circumscribed by a sense of honor and by professionalism, and for those for whom this is not enough, by the Bar's canons of ethics and disciplinary rules and, for federal prosecutors, the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice. 
Mr. Starr has a different view of these obligations, and privacy has been the first casualty. He began his investigation into the President's personal life by using the results of an illegal wiretap. The State of Maryland protects its residents from having private conversations tape recorded without their knowledge or consent. Mr. Starr condoned the deliberate flouting of that law by granting the perpetrator immunity and then using the illicit recordings to persuade the Attorney General to expand his jurisdiction. 
That was just the beginning. In February, Prosecutor Starr forced a mother to travel to the country's Capital to sit before a federal grand jury, with no right to have counsel present, and reveal the most intimate secrets of her daughter. That led me to introduce legislation to develop Federal prosecutorial guidelines to protect familial privacy and parent-child communications in matters that do not involve allegations of violent conduct or drug trafficking. 
Mr. Starr issued subpoenas to bookstores to pry into what we read and further encroached upon our First Amendment rights with subpoenas to reporters, at every step acting contrary to Justice Department guidelines. He intruded into the attorney-client privilege, and even required Secret Service agents to gossip about those whom they are sworn to protect, and whose privacy they have safeguarded for decade upon decade. Then all of the private information he gathered, all of the excruciating details of personal life, appeared almost contemporaneously in the public press, attributed to unidentified sources, despite the command of the law that all matters before a grand jury remain secret. 
The independent counsel law was passed with the best of intentions, with my support. I never imagined that the power would be so abused, and privacy so ignored. But that is the point. We must act to prevent abuses of privacy. 
Mr. Starr, by his gross excesses, has become a symbol of the threat to privacy and the threat to individual liberty from abuse of power and information. That threat has been amplified by the unseemly haste with which the Republican majority on the House Judiciary Committee voted to plaster the mud from Ken Starr's report all over the Internet, so that literally all the world would have a chance to peek through the keyhole. This intemperate action, in an unabashed effort to gain political advantage at the expense of privacy and dignity, should be a lesson to the American people that we need additional legal protection to protect their privacy. 
The far more pervasive problem is the incremental encroachment on privacy through the lack of safeguards on personal, financial and medical information about each of us that can be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way into the wrong hands with a push of a button. 
The right of privacy is one of the most vulnerable rights in the information age. The digitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. But the new technology also presents new threats to our individual privacy and security, in particular, our ability to control the terms under which our personal information is acquired, disclosed, and used. 
The threats are there, but so are the solutions, if we only take the time to look for them. For example, this Congress passed legislation that will make the United States government more accessible and accountable to the citizenry by directing Federal agencies to accept `electronic signatures' for government forms that are submitted electronically. When the bill was reported out of committee, it established a framework for government use of electronic signatures without putting in place any privacy protections for the vast amounts of personal information collected in the process. I was concerned that citizens would be forced to sacrifice their privacy as the price of communicating with the government electronically. Senator Abraham and I corrected this oversight by adding forward-looking privacy protections to the bill, which strictly limit the ways in which information collected as a byproduct of electronic communications with the government can be used or disclosed to others. 
As I remarked when the bill passed, however, this is just the beginning of Congress's efforts to address the new privacy issues raised by electronic government and the information age. Congress will almost certainly be called upon in the next session to consider broader electronic signature legislation, and issues of law enforcement access to electronic data and mechanisms for enforcing privacy rights in cyberspace will need to be part of that discussion. 
The government also holds tens of millions of medical records of individuals covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health programs. This information is routinely released by the government in individually-identifiable form for purposes such as medical research or in order to ferret out fraud and abuse. These are laudable activities, but without setting strong standards for an entity to meet before gaining access to this information there is the possibility of misuse and abuse of this very sensitive personal information. 
We have a Federal Privacy Act in this country that has not been substantially changed since its passage almost 25 years ago. One purpose of the Privacy Act was to protect our citizens from government intrusion and the sharing of data across agencies without the knowledge or consent of the subject of the information. Yet, the Privacy Act contains a problematic `routine use' exception, which is already a huge loophole to use health and other information for any purpose. 
I first noted my concern with this loophole during congressional hearings in 1996 on the transfer by the FBI of background investigation files to the White House for former Republican White House employees. The FBI admitted that it made these transfers pursuant to the `routine use' exception. Ironically, more information from the confidential FBI background files were revealed to the public in the course of congressional hearings than from any action taken elsewhere. For example, it was a House Committee that first revealed the names of people whose file summaries were requested. It was also a House Committee that used information from a Clinton White House employee's file to embarrass him and it was a House Chairman who `went public' with the confidential FBI background memo from the employee's background file in a statement made on the floor of the House. That is why during those hearings, on September 25, 1996, I called for a reexamination of the Privacy Act and tightening of the routine use loophole. 
My concern is heightened by a July 16, 1998, published notice by the Health Care Financing Administration to add new `routine uses' to the Privacy Act. The proposal is very broad. In the name of combating fraud and abuse, this proposal would permit the release of individual specific information to any governmental or non-governmental entity that has anything to do with health care. This new HCFA `routine use' exception proposal turns our notion of privacy protection on its head, and makes more urgent the need for review of and restrictions on the `routine use' of private medical and other information collected and held by the government. 
At a time when the Congress and the Administration are grappling with how best to protect the privacy of individually-identifiable medical records in the private health care sector, we better make sure that we have our own house in order. I introduced legislation in this Congress that would help protect the privacy of individually-identifiable medical records, and I plan to expand on that initiative in the next Congress to ensure that such records are not mishandled by Federal agencies. 
The next Congress will also need to consider how our privacy safeguards for personal, financial and medical information measure up to the tough privacy standards established by the European Union. The EU Data Protection Directive is set to take effect next week. That could be a big problem for American businesses, since the new rules require EU member countries to prohibit the transmission of personal data to or through any non-EU country that fails to provide adequate data protection as defined under European law. European officials have said repeatedly over the past year that the patchwork of privacy laws in the United States may not meet their standards. Our law is less protective than EU standards in a variety of respects on a range of issues, including requirements to obtain data fairly and lawfully; limitations on the collection of sensitive data; limitations on the purpose of data collection; bans on the collection and storage of unnecessary personal information; requirements regarding data accuracy; limitations regarding duration of storage; and centralized supervision of privacy protections and practices. 
The flow of information from Europe may not stop suddenly on Monday, but the clock is ticking. Europe is committed to enforcing the Directive. Our continued failure to address this issue could have serious economic consequences for U.S. firms and transborder data flows. 
When we do address this issue--hopefully early in the next Congress--we may find that the problem is not that Europe protects privacy too much. We may find that the problem is our own failure to keep U.S. privacy laws up to date. The EU Directive is an example of the kind of privacy protection that American consumers need and do not have. It has encouraged European companies to develop good privacy techniques. It has produced policies, including policies on cryptography, that are consistent with the interests of both consumers and businesses. 
Even if we decide not to lock in the commands of the EU Data Directive, we can learn from it. Marc Rotenberg, the Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, made this point eloquently earlier this year, when he testified before the House Committee on International Relations: `The EU Data Directive is not so much a problem as it is a reminder that our privacy laws are out of date.' I agree with his conclusion that, in the end, `we need stronger privacy safeguards not to satisfy European government, but to assure the protection of our own citizens.' 
There is a cartoonish quality to the excesses of Ken Starr and the ham-handedness of the House Republican leadership, who seem to be vying for the title of poster child for privacy reform legislation. This could lull us into a false sense that their sort of nonsense may be pernicious, but it is not something that affects the average citizen. Do not be misled. It bears repeating again and again that personal, financial and medical information of any American can fall into the wrong hands. 
Americans are rightly concerned about the adequacy of privacy protection in this country. Indeed, this is a matter that concerns all Americans in the most personal of ways. 
The European Union has responded to the demands of the information age with tough privacy standards. The privacy protections in our new digital signature legislation show that we can get ahead of the curve, anticipate problems and head them off even before they arise, if only we give the matter the attention it deserves.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate concludes this second session of the 105th Congress, I want to take a moment to thank Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for working with us to confirm judges desperately needed around the country. He pressed forward with three confirmation hearings in October, which resulted in sending another nine judicial nominees to the Senate calendar. He supported each of the nominees confirmed by the Senate this year and worked hard to clear judicial nominees reported by the Committee for action by the Senate. I also thank the Majority Leader for proceeding to consider the judicial nominations confirmed in these last days of the session. 
For the year, the Senate confirmed 65 federal judges to the District Courts and Courts of Appeals around the country and to the Court of International Trade. In addition, we confirmed a number of judges to the United States Court of Claims and to the court for the Northern Mariana Islands. 
Senator Hatch is fond of saying that the Senate could do better. I agree with him and hope that we will continue to do better next year. I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace it established in the last nine months of last year. Had we done so, we could have confirmed 90 judges. Instead, the Senate has acted to confirm only 65 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies the federal judiciary experienced this year. 
Together with the 36 judges confirmed last year, the total number of article III federal judges confirmed during this Congress to a 2-year total of 101--the same total that was confirmed in one year when Democrats made up the majority of the Senate in 1994. The 104th Congress (1995-96) resulted in a 2-year total of only 75 judges being confirmed. By way of contrast, I note that during the last two years of the Bush Administration, even including the presidential election year of 1992, a Democratic Senate confirmed 124 federal judges. 
Meanwhile 50 judicial vacancies remain. This is one of the largest number of vacancies left unfilled at the end of a Congress. In 1983 vacancies numbered only 16. Even after the creation of 85 new judgeships in 1984, the number of vacancies had been reduced to only 33 by the end of the 99th Congress in 1986. At the end of the 100th Congress in 1988, which had a Democratic majority and a Republican president, judicial vacancies numbered only 23. In 1996 the Republican Senate adjourned leaving 64 judicial vacancies. This year the Senate is adjourning leaving 50 judicial vacancies and the number is likely to increase during the recess. 
Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a Republican presidential administration. Last year the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S.678, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 103 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several years. 
In order to understand why a judicial vacancy crisis is plaguing so many federal courts, we need only recall how unproductive the Republican Senate has been over the last three years. More and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for longer periods of time. The President has sent the Senate qualified nominees for 23 of the current judicial emergency vacancies, 15 of those nominations that are still pending as the Senate prepares to adjourn. 
In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focussed on the problem of `too few judges and too much work.' He noted the vacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies and observed: `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.' He went on to note: `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.' 
During the entire 4 years of the Bush administration there were only three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as long as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a year. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more than 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended over a 
year to a year and one-half. Of the judges confirmed this year, Professor Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the United States--Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. 
I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky nominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. This year the Senate will break last year's record. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges confirmed this year was over 230 days. 
In addition, nominations are being forced to sit on the Senate Executive Calendar for longer and longer periods of time. Unlike earlier days in the Senate when nominees were not made to wait for weeks and months on the Senate calendar before they could be considered, that is now becoming the rule. Margaret Morrow, Sonia Sotomayor, Richard Paez, Ronnie White, Patrick Murphy and Michael McCuskey each spent more than four months on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting action. 
Further, this Congress is concluding with four judicial nominations that have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee still pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. Two were reported without objection by unanimous consent. I do not know why Justice Ronnie L. White and Judge William J. Hibbler, two outstanding African-American nominees are being held on the Senate calendar without a vote. I regret that the Majority Leader was unable to call up for a vote the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit or the nomination of Timothy Dyk to the Federal Circuit. 
Most Congresses end without any judicial nominations left on the Senate Executive Calendar. Indeed the 99th, 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses all ended without a single judicial nomination left on the Senate calendar. The Democratic Senate majority in the two Congresses of the Bush Administration ended both those Congresses, the 101st and 102nd, without a single judicial nomination on the calendar. By contrast, the Republican Senate majority in the last Congress, the 104th, left an unprecedented seven judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar at adjournment without Senate action. The 105th Congress is concluding with four qualified judicial nominees being denied action by the Senate. 
At each step of the process, judicial nominations are being delayed and stalled. Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie L. White, Judge William J. Hibbler and Timothy Dyk are being denied consideration by the Senate. Marsha Berzon, Anabelle Rodriquez, Clarence Sundram, and Matthew Kennelly were each denied a vote before the Judiciary Committee following a hearing. Judge James A. Beatty, Jr., Helene N. White, Jorge C. Rangel, Ronald M. Gould, Robert S. Raymar, Barry P. Goode, among a total of 13 judicial nominees, end this Congress without ever having received a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. 
At the conclusion of the debate on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as 23 Republicans were preparing to vote against that exceptionally well-qualified nominee whose confirmation had been delayed 18 months, Senator Hatch said `playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it.' I agree with him. I look forward to a return to the days when judicial nominations are treated with the respect and attention that they deserve.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to bid a fond farewell to one of our most senior senators, Senator Wendell Ford, who, despite my objections, is leaving the Senate this year. I think that all members will agree that his departure will be a loss for the Senate and nation, as we are losing one of our most respected and well-liked Senators. 
Senator Ford and I began our careers in the United States Senate together--24 years ago. It seeks like just yesterday we were the new kids on the block, trying to get the hang of the Senate. A lot has changed from those early days, as Senator Ford has proudly served the people of Kentucky while serving on the Committees on Rules and Administration (where he is ranking member), Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Joint Committee on Printing (where he was formerly Chairman). 
Hailing from Thurston, Kentucky, Senator Ford has brought to the Senate a long and distinguished career as well as the down-home common sense for which he is known. A graduate of the University of Kentucky, Wendell went on to serve in the United States Army in 1944-1946 and in the Kentucky Army National Guard for 13 years. Senator Ford has long been associated with public service, as he served as a Kentucky state senator, lieutenant governor and as Kentucky's 49th Governor. 
Senator Ford has come a long way from being a new kid on the U.S. Senate block in 1974 to becoming the longest serving Senator from Kentucky today. And, I might add, he is now one of the most senior members of the entire Senate and one who follows the old traditions of the Senate as one who always keeps his word. 
Throughout his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Wendell has been recognized as a national leader in campaign-finance reform, energy issues, and, of course, looking out for our nation's tobacco farmers. That has never been as much as an issue as it has this past year, with Congress' attempts at passing tobacco legislation. 
A friend to the environment, Senator Ford was the first to introduce and pass a program instructing the federal government to be a model for the country and use recycled printed paper. This program is now the rule rather than the exception in the federal government, as well as schools and businesses throughout the United States. 
It is with much regret that I say goodbye to Senator Ford. He has been a great friend all of these years in the Senate, and I will miss him greatly. I hope that retirement brings him plenty of time to spend with his wife, Jean, and their five grandchildren. Knowing Wendell, however, I have no doubt that retirement will be neither quiet nor slow him down.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are all going to greatly miss our friend Senator Bumpers. He is certainly one of the finest orators this body has enjoyed since Daniel Webster. But I want to take a moment to personally thank Senator Bumpers. 
Senator Bumpers and I came to the Senate as part of the class of 1974. So I had very mixed feelings last year when I heard that my good friend would be leaving this Chamber. He and I have shared many battles over the twenty-four years that we have spent in these halls and on this floor. And, as my good friend pointed out just a few days ago, I am not even half as entertaining as him, so his shoes will be hard to fill. 
However, as Senator Bumpers has often remarked, he has probably fought more losing battles in this Chamber than any other Member. He is leaving those battles for the rest of us to fight. He has laid down a marker for where our country must go in the next century. His challenge to us who remain in this Chamber is to frame laws that show respect to our country's founders and to our country's future. 
He has fought tirelessly to defend our Bill of Rights and only yesterday warned this Chamber against of the temptation of amending what he has often called `our sacred document.' Senator Bumpers has shown great courage over the years in his steadfast protection of our Constitution. 
As he has pointed out many times, he has taken a lot of political heat for voting against popular issues like school prayer, flag burning and the balanced budget amendment. But even though he has voted against all of these things and voted for our Constitution, he is walking out of this Chamber by his own choice. His courage should guide us all in our choices between Popular issues of the day and protecting our Constitution. 
His legacy will also be marked by an intense desire to pass on to his grandchildren and to all of our grandchildren a world where you can still find places of solitude and beauty, streams where you can still catch trout and salmon and forests where you can still find trees older than your grandparents. 
That is why it is only fitting that in the last few days of this Congress we are able to honor Senator Bumpers by dedicating wilderness areas within the Ozark and Ouachita National Forests to his long, and often lonely, fight to protect our nation's most precious natural resources. 
His marker also represents a world where children are free from disease and free from debt. Dale and his wife Betty have not only made a professional commitment to protecting the health of our children, but they have made this a personal commitment. 
Even if Dale was still a Main Street merchant or a jackleg merchant, as he described himself, Betty would still be dragging him into these fights to protect our children's health. Although I know that she has never had to pull very hard, because his commitment comes from the heart. 
Many of us will remember the Senator Bumpers not only for a keeper of our national treasures, but also as a chaser of boondoggles. Whether it be reining in government subsidies for mining companies or chemical companies, he is never one to pull punches or mince words. 
In fact, one of the only reasons I can come up with for Congress still not passing mining reform is that we all so love to see Dale take over the aisles of this Chamber and entertain us with his now re-known `Bumperisms.' Who else would think to compare the attraction between our mining companies and government subsidies to a `duck on a June bug.' 
Of course, Dale certainly would not be one to limit his battles to planet Earth. He has also taken on the black holes we've tried build in outer space. I will not be surprised at all if we start receiving Bumper-Grams from Arkansas each week telling us how many millions we have spent in the last seven days on the International Space Station. Although this fight is not over, Senator Bumpers can leave here knowing he helped stop the ill-conceived `Star Wars' to make our heavens a battlefield. 
Although we will certainly miss Senator Bumpers for all his one-liners, impassioned speeches, and frank critiques, we will also miss his wonderful wife, Betty. As we leave here this week, I will look fondly on Senator Bumpers future--spending his days with Betty, his three children, Brent, Bill, and Brooke and their five grandchildren. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me help send our dear friend by quoting from another highly-esteemed Arkansan, Johnny Cash, `ask that engineer if he will blow his whistle please, `Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves. . . . And I smell that Southern breeze. Hey, Porter! Hey, Porter! Please get my bags for me, I need nobody to tell me now that we're in Tennessee. . . . Hey Porter! Hey Porter! Please open up my door. When they stop this train I'm gonna get off first `Cause I can't wait no more. Tell that engineer I say, `Thanks a lot. I didn't mind the fare. I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil. . . . And breathe that Southern air.' 
We all hope that Southern air treats you and Betty well.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as this Congress draws to a close, much has been and will be said about what has and has not been accomplished. There is no getting away from the fact that Congress has dropped the ball on too many issues of vital importance to the American people. I need only mention campaign finance reform, a patients' bill of rights, and the failure to pass tough legislation on youth smoking. I have spoken often about the failure of this Congress to live up to its constitutional advice and consent responsibilities with respect to nominations. In addition, this is the first year since enactment of the Congressional Budget Act that Congress has failed to pass a budget. There is much about the record of the 105th Congress with which I have been disappointed and with which the American people should find fault. 
In the area of criminal justice, I particularly regret Congress' failure to pass balanced juvenile crime legislation, the Democratic crime bills, S. 15 and S. 2484, or comprehensive legislation on behalf of crime victims. At the same time, I would like to highlight those important measures that we have been able to pass.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that the House of Representatives has, at long last, taken up and passed the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act, S. 610, that the Senate had passed and sent to the House more than a years ago. This measure was included in the omnibus spending bill passed by the House last night and by the Senate today. 
Over 10 years ago, in May 1988, as chairman of the then Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, I convened hearings on High Tech Terrorism, including terrorism with chemical and biological weapons and terrorist attacks on computer infrastructure. We have made progress in those 10 years, but we need to do more. I was proud to have played a role in Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention last year. This was a matter initiated under President Reagan, negotiated by President Bush, and signed on behalf of the United States by President Clinton. 
We also proceeded to pass implementing legislation, which addressed complex technical and constitutional issues and about which there was great potential for delay. We were able to overcome that delay, however, and reach a sound consensus with admirable speed. The bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee on April 17, 1997, and we held hearings and reported out the bill in just over a month. That bill passed the Senate on May 23, 1997. That shows what we can do here when we put our minds to it. 
I am gratified that the stall in House consideration of this important implementing legislation for the Chemical and Biological Weapons Treaty has finally ended. Further delay and a failure to act on the part of the House on what is so obviously a pressing national priority, would have been a great blow to the Nation and to the national security.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I first introduced this legislation over six years ago after the General Accounting Office concluded that U.S. policy to ensure imported food safety is inadequate and in need of reform. Changes have taken place since, but our policy of allowing pesticides that are prohibited for use within the United States be exported to other countries remains. 
The United States should be proud of the strict regulations that we have on the production and use of pesticides. But we should be embarrassed that the loophole in current law allowing U.S. chemical companies to export dangerous pesticides--pesticides banned in the U.S: has not been eliminated. This loophole must be eliminated to protect the American consumer and American farmer and to halt the immoral practice of sending dangerous pesticides overseas to be handled and applied by unsuspecting farmworkers. 
My `Circle of Poison' bill is designed to protect the public from pesticide residues on imported food. It is unreasonable to expect that, in these times of tight budgets and limited resources, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be able to monitor each shipment of imported food for each pesticide that a foreign farmer may use. FDA import inspections have declined dramatically in just the last four years, so that now less than two percent of FDA-regulated imported food is subject to any type of inspection. 
It is possible, however, to aid FDA by limiting the number of dangerous pesticides which U.S. chemical companies supply to foreign farmers. By banning the export of pesticides which EPA has not deemed safe, the `circle of poison' legislation will reduce the availability of some of the most hazardous pesticides. By curtailing the supply, it is less likely that foreign farmers will use these pesticides, and therefore, less likely that these pesticides will end up on food that Americans consume. 
In addition, this bill puts American farmers on an equal footing with foreign farmers. Under the bill, if a pesticide is not legal for American farmers to use, it will not be legal for foreign farmers to use on food that is exported to the U.S. A simple and reasonable concept, but a concept which is not yet in place in the real world. 
Finally, it is simply wrong to allow the export of illegal pesticides. If the Environmental Protection Agency does not allow our citizens and environment to be exposed to a pesticide, we should not subject other countries to the hazards of the pesticide. A pesticide that may endanger people and the environment in the U.S. does not diminish in toxicity simply because it has been exported.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week's Washington Post proclaimed in one headline, `High Tech is King of the Hill,' citing the passage of several bills which I actively supported, including restricting Internet taxes, enhancing protection for copyrighted works online, and encouraging companies to share information to avoid Year 2000 computer failures. Yet, anyone familiar with the Internet proposals buried in the Omnibus Appropriations measure would be writing a different headline this week. 
Certain provisions in this huge spending bill repeat the mistakes about regulating speech on the Internet that the last Congress made when it passed the Communications Decency Act, the `CDA-I.' I opposed the CDA from the start as fatally flawed and flagrantly unconstitutional. I predicted that the CDA would not pass constitutional muster and, along with Senator Feingold, sought to repeal the CDA so that we would not have to wait for the Supreme Court to fix our mistake. 
We did not fix the mistake and so, as I predicted, the Supreme Court eventually did our work for us. All nine Justices agreed that the CDA was, at least in part, unconstitutional. Justice Stevens, writing for seven members of the Court, called the CDA `patently invalid' and warned that it cast a `dark shadow over free speech' and `threaten[ed] to torch a large segment of the Internet community.' Reno v. ACLU, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 2350 (1997). The Court's decision came as no surprise to me, and should have come as no surprise to the 84 members of the Senate who supported the legislation. 
We had been warned by constitutional scholars and Internet experts that the approach we were taking in the CDA would not stand up in court and did not make sense for the Internet. In the end, three district court panels and the Supreme Court all ultimately agreed in striking down the CDA-I as an unconstitutional restriction on free expression. 
Congress is about to make the same mistake again by including in the Omnibus Appropriations bill the `Child Online Protection Act,' or `CDA-II.' I have spoken before, on July 21, 1998, about my opposition to a version of this legislation that was included, without debate, on the annual funding bill for the Commerce, State and Justice Departments. 
My opposition to these efforts to regulate Internet speech should not be misunderstood. I join with the sponsors of these measures in wanting to protect children from harm. I prosecuted child abusers as State's Attorney in Vermont, and have worked my entire professional life to protect children from those who would prey on them. In fact, earlier this month, the Congress passed the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine version of the `Protection of Children from Sexual Predator Act,' H.R. 3494, to enhance our Federal laws outlawing child pornography. We should act whenever possible to protect our children, but we have a duty to ensure that the means we use to protect our children do not do more harm than good. As the Supreme Court made clear when it struck down CDA-I, laws that prohibit protected speech do not become constitutional merely because they were enacted for the important purpose of protecting children. 
CDA-II makes a valiant effort to address many of the Supreme Court's technical objections to the CDA. Nevertheless, while narrower than its CDA-I predecessor, this legislation continues to suffer from substantial constitutional and practical defects. The core holding of the CDA-I case was that `the vast democratic fora of the Internet' deserves the highest level of protection from government intrusion--the highest level of First Amendment scrutiny. Courts will assess the constitutionality of laws that regulate speech over the Internet by the same demanding standards that have traditionally applied to laws affecting the press. 
The CDA-II provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill do not meet those standards. 
CDA-II would penalize the posting `for commercial purposes' on the World Wide Web of any material that is `harmful to minors.' Penalties include fines of up to $50,000 per day of violation, up to 6 months' imprisonment and, under a separate section of the bill, forfeiture of eligibility for the Internet tax moratorium. Like the old CDA-I, this new provision creates an affirmative defense for those who restrict access by requiring use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, adult personal identification number, a digital certificate verifying age, or other reasonable measures. This new criminal prohibition raises a number of constitutional and practical issues that have been entirely ignored by this Congress. 
First, the scope of CDA-II is unclear. The prohibition applies to anyone `engaged in the business' of making any communication for commercial purposes by means of the World Wide Web. Vendors selling pornographic material from Web sites are clearly covered, but also many other unsuspecting persons and businesses operating Web sites will likely fall under this prohibition. Under new section 231(e)(2)(B) of title 47, U.S.C., `it is not necessary that the person make a profit' or that the Web site `be the person's sole or principal business or source of income.' Does CDA-II cover companies that offer free Web sites, but charge for their off-line services? If CDA-II does not apply in that circumstance, would the measure have the unintended effect of encouraging the posting of `harmful' materials on the Web for free? Does CDA-II apply to a business that merely advertises on the Web? Does CDA-II apply to public service postings sponsored by businesses on the Web? 
In the face of this uncertainty, entrepreneurs, small businesses and other companies who maintain a Web site as a way to enhance their business may face criminal liability if they post material--for free, for advertising, or for a fee--which some community in this country may perceive to be `harmful to minors.' 
Second, CDA-II adopts a `harmful to minors' standard that will likely be found unconstitutional. CDA-II defines `material that is harmful to minors' as what the `average person, applying contemporary community standards,' would find, taken as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to appeal to the prurient interest, depicts in a manner patently offensive to minors actual or simulated sexual acts or contact, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The provision further defines a `minor' to be `any person under 17 years of age.' 
The `17 year old' age cutoff in CDA-II makes this measure significantly more restrictive than the `harmful to minors' statutes adopted in most states, including in my home state of Vermont. Most state `harmful to minors' statutes restrict materials that would be harmful to minors under the age of 18. These statutes are interpreted to prohibit only that material which would be harmful for the oldest minor. Thus, by setting the age at `under 17,' CDA-II would prohibit material on the Web that is inappropriate or harmful for 16 year olds. Consequently, CDA-II would impose more restrictions on the material that can be freely accessible on the World Wide Web than most states impose on materials available for sale in bookstores, news stands, and movie theaters within their borders. 
Yet, unlike books, magazines, movies or even broadcasts, where the vendor can control the physical places to which the material is distributed, a person posting material on a Web site cannot restrict access to only Internet users from certain geographic regions. Indeed, Web site operators often cannot determine the region of the country, or the world, from which users are initiating their access. 
As a consequence, Web site operators will have to tailor the material accessible on their sites to content that would pass muster in the most conservative community in the country for children 16 years old and younger. The standards of every other community would be discounted. Thus, the bill's core effect will be to set--for the first time--a single, national harmful to minors standard for material on the World Wide Web. Moreover, this standard will be more restrictive than those already in place in most states. 
This result runs counter to existing `harmful to minors' law as articulated by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has never approved of a single, national obscenity standard, nor has it approved a `harmful to minors' statute based on a national, as opposed to local, standard. On the contrary, the Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 30-32 (1973), stated that:  
our Nation is simply too big and too diverse . . . to reasonably expect that such standards could be articulated for all 50 States in a single formulation. . . . It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City. 
Reducing the material available on the Web to that which only the most conservative community in the country deems to be appropriate for 16-year-olds, could very well remove material that is both constitutionally protected and socially valuable. The online publication of the Starr report, in whole or in part, Robert Mappelthorpe's pictures, or PG, PG-13, and certainly R-rated movies or TV shows would be suspect. 
CDA-II provides an affirmative defense for online publishers of such material that demand credit card numbers or other adult identification. A similar defense did not save CDA-I, however, and remains insufficient to reduce the significant burden on protected speech that the new prohibition imposes. The Supreme Court noted in analyzing this defense in CDA-I, that such a requirement would `completely bar adults who do not have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from accessing any blocked material.' 117 S.Ct at 2337. 
In addition to burdening the speech rights of adults, the Supreme Court questioned the effectiveness of this defense in CDA-I to protect children, stating: 
 . . . it is not economically feasible for most noncommercial speakers to employ such verification . . . Even with respect to commercial pornographers that would be protected by the defense, the Government failed to adduce any evidence that these verification techniques actually preclude minors from posing as adults. Given that the risk of criminal sanctions `hovers over each content provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles,' the District Court correctly refused to rely on unproven future technology to save the statute.' 117 S.Ct. at 2349-50. 
The technology required to exercise the affirmative defense remains practically difficult and prohibitively expensive for many Web sites. As a result, just as the Supreme Court found with CDA-I, CDA-II would effectively chill the publication of a large amount of valuable, constitutionally-protected speech on popular commercial web sites such as CNN.com, amazon.com, or the New York Times online. As the Court restated in its decision on CDA-I, `[t]he level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox.' 117 
S.Ct. at 2346. 
Third, CDA-II will be ineffective at protecting children. In evaluating whether the burdens that CDA-II will place on Web publishers are justified, we must take a realistic look at how well these new restrictions will work to protect children from harmful online materials. As the Supreme Court noted, adult identification or verification techniques can be falsely used by children to gain access to forbidden material. 
In addition, CDA-II is limited to activity on the Web, presumably to capture the material that the Supreme Court believed was susceptible to use of verified credit cards. Those of us who use the Internet recognize that the Web is merely one of several Internet protocols, although the one most amenable to pictorial or graphic displays. Limiting the reach of this measure to the Web excludes newsgroups, FTP sites, e-mail, chat rooms, private electronic bulletin board systems (BBS), and gopher sites, where children may continue to access harmful materials. Indeed, I am concerned that the unintended consequence of applying CDA-II's ill-considered speech restrictions on the Web will simply force Internet content providers and users to use or develop other protocols with which they would be able to exercise their First Amendment rights unfettered by the threat of criminal prosecution. 
Those of us who use the Internet and the World Wide Web also recognize that this is a global medium, not just a network under United States control. Indeed, a large percentage of content on the Internet originates outside the United States, and is as accessible over the Web as material posted next door. Objectionable material is likely to come from outside the United States and be unreachable by American laws.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a report issued by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Agriculture raises very serious concerns about the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), the Milk Industry Foundation (MIF) and the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board (Board) in terms of the fluid milk promotion program. 
The Inspector General (IG) report identifies: unapproved expenditures in violation of law, potential conflicts of interest, possible cover-up activities, inaccurate financial statements, sole-source contracting, inadequate controls over contracting, excessive payments, failure to enforce contracts, property disputes over ownership of copyrights, and other serious violations by the Board or its agents IDFA and MIF. 
The fluid milk promotion law contains penalties for violations including, on conviction, a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. The law also provides that `nothing . . . shall authorize the Secretary to withhold information from a duly authorized committee or subcommittee of Congress.' I serve on three committees and I have a keen interest in this matter. 
It is also a violation for funds collected under the law `to be used in any manner for the purpose of influencing legislation or government action or policy.' 
I will omit details, but as background note that the law allows the appointment of a Board which may enter into contracts, with the approval of the Secretary, to carry out milk promotion and research programs. Funds are generated by a 20-cent per hundredweight assessment on certain processors of milk. This assessment is imposed through an order which is binding on processors. 
The Board is to `keep minutes . . . and promptly report minutes of each Board meeting to the Secretary.' The Board may pay for the advertising of fluid milk if authorized by the Secretary. Programs or projects can not become effective except `on the approval of the Secretary.' Also, the law provides that the Board is to `administer the order.' 
The law does not provide for the involvement of IDFA or MIF specifically. However, the Board is authorized, with approval of the Secretary, to enter into contracts or agreements and is authorized to employ such persons as the Board considers necessary. 
As background for those not familiar with these organizations, note that IDFA's website says that `IDFA serves as an umbrella organization for three constituent groups: the Milk Industry Foundation, the National Cheese Institute, and the International Ice Cream Association. . . .' IDFA is an association for `processors, manufacturers, marketers, distributors and suppliers of dairy foods, including milk, cheese, and ice cream and frozen desserts.' More than 800 companies are in IDFA. MIF has 185 member companies, the National Cheese Institute has 95 member companies, and 150 companies are members of the International Ice Cream Association. 
Given the seriousness of the charges, I believe the Secretary of Agriculture should immediately terminate its support for the fluid milk promotion arrangement between the Board and MIF and IDFA, and immediately begin searching for a replacement for those two associations to continue fluid milk promotion efforts. I am sending a letter to the Secretary that contains this request and restates some of the points that I am mentioning in this floor statement. 
I believe that a lot of the violations identified by the IG could have been eliminated if the Board had contracted directly with an advertising agency to do the milk promotion campaign. This would have avoided middlemen such as IDFA being able to skim money off the top in a manner that does not efficiently implement the law. 
I will highlight just some of the concerns raised by the Inspector General's report. For example, it was not until three months after the Board's first contract with MIF had expired, and after the IG audit was begun, that the Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA approved that contract. MIF and the Board even agreed that the contract would not be effective until approved by USDA. However, by the time it had been approved `the Board had paid MIF over $3 million and MIF, in turn, had contracted with an advertising firm which had spent over $123 million.' 
The IG report continues:  
Even though it did not have the authority to do so, MIF entered into an agreement with a major advertising agency to provide most of the Board's advertising, public relations, and research. 
Payments were made regarding 37 contracts which neither MIF, IDFA, the Board, or AMS could find so as to provide copies to the IG. 
Also, the IG's report says that `the financial statement as of March 31, 1995, and as of April 30, 1996, contained material omissions and questionable statements that, in the aggregate, were significant enough to affect the decisions of its users, including the Secretary, members of the U.S. Congress, and milk processors.' 
I want to send a clear message to the Board, to IDFA, or anyone else, that Members of Congress do not like being misled. The IG report also notes that the processor Board has `allowed the payment of over $127 million in expenses that were not supported by AMS-approved contracts,' in violation of law. 
$127 million is a lot of money but the situation is much worse. These funds are being raised by a mandatory assessment of processors of 20 cents/cwt. Yet, IDFA has charged in letters to the Secretary that increased assessments of processors will be passed through to consumers. So, if IDFA is correct, these assessments were paid by consumers but used to implement contracts that had not been approved. 
I wish it were not the case that IDFA and its affiliated group, MIF, strongly contend that these types of assessments on processors are borne by consumers. 
The IG also called into question the `independence of some of the key contractor employees who have been assigned responsibility for Board activities.' Who are some of these key contractors? The Milk Industry 
Foundation, the International Dairy Foods Association, `outside legal counsel' and an unnamed `Worldwide Advertising and Public Relations Firm' are key contractors. 
On top of all the wrongdoing described in the Report, three key contractors have in their employment persons who are registered with the Congress as lobbyists. I am stunned that processor lobbyists who often work against the interests of dairy farmers, or support litigation against the Secretary and against the interests of dairy farmers, have some say over who gets this money. 
I admit that it is natural that representatives of processors, whether they are milk, peanut, sugar, or corn processors, want to buy inputs cheaply. However, low farm prices are not in the best interests of the farmers who produce those products. With just a few exceptions most farm-state Senators support stronger prices for their farmers instead of lower prices for their farmers. 
Indeed, it would make most hardworking dairy farmers sick to hear the salaries paid by the Board. An unnamed Board administrator had a `contract increased in February 1998 to $180,000 for 23 hours of work per week.' That is pretty good work if you can get it, especially considering what the average dairy farmer nets in a year and how hard our farmers work. 
I understand that MIF and IDFA are not registered as nonprofit entities. They may actually be for-profit organizations. Certainly their employees believe in big profits for themselves when you look at their salaries. 
In a very bizarre and suspicious twist, the processor Board contracted with MIF to appoint one of MIF's employees as Executive Director of the Milk Processor Education Program. But the processor Board was `fully aware that MIF had no employees.' MIF had to rely on IDFA for staff. 
One of IDFA's senior employees was none other than the former head of the dairy division at USDA, Charlie Shaw. One of IDFA's hired lobbyists was a former high-level official at USDA, William Wasserman, now with M & R Associates. Another of IDFA's hired lobbyists is a former Senior Vice President of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, Alan Rosenfeld. IDFA has also contributed lots of dough to Public Voice and Public Voice events, as have huge food processors. 
This is a very cozy arrangement. MIF, which is run by IDFA, sued to end a program that generates a lot of additional income to dairy farmers in New England--the Northeast Dairy Compact. It generates this income for farmers by making processors pay a stable and fair price for milk. That was too much for MIF, so they sued the Secretary. This is an irony: MIF and IDFA oppose the Dairy Compact because of the small premiums assessed on dairy processors to help keep farmers in business and yet they support an assessment imposed on dairy processors when it benefits processors. 
To be consistent regarding assessments, MIF and IDFA would have to oppose this program that they support. Also, Public Voice would have bite the IDFA hand that feeds it. But that will not happen since so much inside the beltway is based on `show me the money.' 
The IG found other interesting items. MIF is supposed to submit monthly progress reports to the Department of Agriculture. `MIF has never submitted these reports,' according to the IG's report. I would like to know why these violations continued? 
The IG report notes that: 
It is clear that there was no meaningful competition for the development and maintenance of the Board's WEB site. The advertising agency assured that its subsidiary would be selected as the contractor by providing insider information to its subsidiary and accepting the bid proposal after the due date. 
I hope USDA can explain to me what this statement about `providing insider information' means? I will ask USDA if they approved this payment for the WEB site. Any payments identified by the IG and in violation of provisions of the law should be returned. 
In yet another odd development, both IDFA and the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provided the Inspector General with minutes of the processors' Board meetings. However, `there were material differences in the two sets of minutes provided.' Here is the kicker. The Board's administrator said he would reconstruct the minutes. But the IG asks: `We question how the Board's Administrator can `reconstruct' official minutes of Board meetings held since 1994, as he was only appointed to the position in 1996.' 
The next sentence in the IG's report is telling: `Neither AMS nor the Board ensured compliance with the [Fluid Milk Promotion] Act or the Order.' Why does Congress bother passing laws if they are just ignored? 
My biggest potential concern is this. IDFA officers and registered lobbyists get control over huge amounts of money from the assessments of processors under the milk order. How do they compartmentalize their time? Do they work against dairy farmers' interests in terms of milk marketing order reform, for example, only when those minutes are paid for through dues and not assessments? When they implement or create strategies to lobby against the dairy compact or Option 1A do they punch out on a time sheet and stop getting paid by assessments under the order? How will we know if the law was followed if the same people both lobby the Congress and USDA and implement the promotion law which prohibits lobbying? 
The law does not permit the use of any funds collected by the Board `in any manner for the purpose of influencing legislation or government action or policy.' 
Yet, IDFA is well-known for its continuing efforts to influence USDA action and policy. It is imperative that all IDFA contacts and phone conversations with USDA regarding legislation affecting the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, dairy compacts in other states, other dairy policy, forward contracting, appropriations bills, and the decision of the Secretary regarding Option 1B be identified. 
IDFA's close work with Alan Rosenfeld of Public Voice, later a lobbyist for IDFA, on dairy issues is well known. Did any of the strategy discussions with Public Voice take place while IDFA's time was being payed for by funds collected under the order? What about the salary negotiations between M & R Associates and Alan Rosenfeld while he was with Public Voice but trying to negotiate a job with IDFA and M & R Associates? 
I will never understand how USDA could approve a contract with IDFA or MIF when the law specifically provides that no funds can be used to influence legislation or government action or policy. 
Indeed, these industry associations are well known to Members of Congress and Hill staff because they give away truckloads of ice cream at the ice cream socials. 
In light of the IG's Report, I am very concerned that money from the assessments under an order, used to benefit processors, may have subsidized efforts to oppose over-order premiums benefiting dairy producers under the dairy compact. In this event the only winners are the middlemen, IDFA and MIF, and the firms making the ads. There is a simple solution to this--get rid of these middlemen unless the Secretary can prevent all their activities trying to influence government policy and legislation. 
All these improper activities and violations are fully explained in the IG Report. Let me present a few more of the highlights. The Report notes that `AMS allowed the Board to commit and/or expend Program funds for 108 contracts, even though it had approved only 3 of these contracts prior to the contracts' effective dates.' Yet section 1999H(c)(8) of the Fluid Milk Promotion Act requires the prior approval by AMS of all contracts prior to the `expenditure of Program funds.' 
I do not think IDFA and MIF should be above the law. Another interesting point is that the `Worldwide Advertising and Public Relations Agency' that I cited earlier had spent $123 million before AMS approved the contract with MIF. Page 23 of the Report noted that `None of the $123 million paid to the advertising agency should have been paid until AMS approved the contracts.' 
The IG says that MIF was aware that `according to the Act and the Order, no payments were permitted until AMS had approved the contract.' Did the advertising firm get lucrative contracts from IDFA, MIF, or their agents or members, to generate press and ads against the Northeast Compact which has greatly increased the income of dairy farmers in New England? Was any of the money raised by the promotion assessments on processors included in donations to Public Voice? 
This matter is especially troubling because the advertising campaign ultimately developed, and the wonderful photos that were used to promote milk consumption, represent a great idea. This situation uncovered by the IG may be the classic example of unnecessary middlemen spoiling an otherwise good situation. 
I support, as do I would think most of my colleagues, the advertising campaign to promote milk sales. Indeed, I have supported legislation to require assessments to promote other agricultural products. I would like the advertising campaign to continue but without the middlemen getting their take. I did not understand why the Board can not just contract with the advertising agency directly. 
The IG report also notes that:  
MIF did not fulfill its contractual responsibilities to the Board by taking the steps necessary to protect the Board's interest in the copyrights to the photographs. We also question why the Board's legal counsel is not pursuing legal action against MIF because of its failure to properly protect the Board's interest in the copyrights. 
On a larger front, I have been concerned with activities of IDFA, MIF and Public Voice for some time. MIF filed litigation in federal court to challenge the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture to implement the Northeast Dairy Compact. In a detailed letter dated April 10, 1996, IDFA strongly urged USDA not to approve the Compact. At the same time, Public Voice used almost the same language and expressed concerns identical to those of IDFA. 
I have previously discussed that extremely close working relationship between Alan Rosenfeld of Public Voice, now with M & R Associates who represents IDFA, and IDFA during this time period. Just a couple of months later, Mr. Rosenfeld was officially listed as a lobbyist with M & R Associates in a lobbyist registration form signed by William Wasserman, formerly the consumer affairs advisor to the Secretary of Agriculture, but by then a hired lobbyist for IDFA. 
For example, in a letter to Secretary Glickman dated April 26, 1996, Alan Rosenfeld used almost identical language as was used in a document called `Talking Points in Opposition to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact' produced by the Campaign for Fair Milk Prices. That Campaign is run by none other than William Wasserman, the registered IDFA lobbyist who hired Alan. 
Fortunately, the Secretary disagreed with the IDFA-Public Voice views. He decided that the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was in the compelling public interest of the compact region. 
There is no question that the giant processors are against the Compact, which gives farmers a little more income and keeps them farming. Most large processors are also for Option 1B, which could reduce the income of dairy farmers by about $1 million per day, according to economists with AgriMark--that is $365 million a year. 
The IG also concluded that the `Board had not followed good business practices by competitively negotiating for contractual services.' $123 million was given to an advertising agency `without competition.' 
I recognize that Kraft, IDFA, and other representatives of manufacturers of milk, or their parent tobacco companies such as Phillip Morris, and those who receive donations from them, want farmers to get a low price for milk. Kraft buys milk to manufacture into products, so of course it wants a low price so it can increase its profits. But at some point if a lot of farmers go out of business, Kraft, IDFA and others might regret the harm they have caused. 
As I said last week, I invite the public and the press to search Federal Election Commission records on this point and to ask groups such as Public Voice for Food and Health Policy how much money they receive from tobacco companies, food processors and milk manufacturers. Members of Congress have expressed a great deal of concern about the false information and misleading studies generated by the Tobacco Institute. 
The International Dairy Foods Association has pumped out a sea of misinformation about the Compact and has tried to influence a lot of lawmakers. They have hired others to disguise the fact that their misinformation campaign was funded with money from these huge milk 
manufacturers. 
Last week I provided details on these matters and listed a few of the groups and the people they hired to spin the press about the Northeast Dairy Compact in a negative way. I described some of the Lobbying Reports that showed the money interconnection. There is no question in Washington that the best way to get to the truth is to follow the money. The problem is that following the money takes a lot of work. 
Public Voice, which is funded by the International Dairy Foods Association, other food processors and IDFA members, is a good example of how this works. 
Even if they all--tobacco, Kraft and Public Voice lobbyists--used the same line, the public is more likely to listen to Public Voice even if someone else wrote the script. The public might not suspect special interest spinning if Public Voice made the point. Of course, if they are all working together the key would be to make sure no one finds out. 
The best way for the public to check this out is to ask Public Voice for the list of who funds them and who sponsors their events. Ask for the list of food processors and tobacco companies who sponsor these events and donate money. Ask Public Voice if they oppose the 20-cent assessments of processors that benefit IDFA and MIF? Or do they just oppose premiums that give dairy farmers more income? 
But, as I recently discussed, some of the truth is found in the Lobby Reports that show who IDFA hired to represent the views of IDFA members. Yes, Public Voice got money, and one employee of Public Voice led the charge against the Compact and then took a job with M & R Associates, one of the groups hired by IDFA to kill the Compact. Public Voice took money from IDFA during this time period. 
Some officials at USDA have views similar to Alan Rosenfeld and William Wasserman, especially those closest to the revolving door. There are many firms in Washington that are used to disguise who they work for so that the public can be easily misled. I would like to know the names of the other clients of M & R Associates. 
I am very concerned about these lobbying efforts to discredit the Compact with misinformation. The address of IDFA listed in Washington Representatives, 1997, is 1250 H. Street, Suite 900, in Washington, D.C. The address of the Milk Industry Foundation is the same. So is the address of the National Cheese Institute. The International Ice Cream Association is also there. 
The Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA has made a big mistake in giving the Milk Industry Foundation control over millions of dollars raised by a mandatory 20-cents-per-hundredweight assessment on many fluid milk products. 
Suppose IDFA or MIF contracted with lobbyists to handle these operations? IDFA or MIF could funnel lucrative contracts using these mandatory assessments to friends who work with them in opposing the Compact, even though the Compact greatly benefits dairy farmers according to the federal Office of Management and Budget. 
Even worse, when IDFA awards contracts on a basis other than competitive bidding, they could funnel money into the hands of their friends who would lobby the Congress against dairy farmers. I want to know the names and salaries of every lobbyist who works for or gets funding from IDFA, MIF, the Cheese Institute, the Tobacco Institute, Phillip Morris, Kraft and the Ice Cream Association. I also want to know the corporate funders of those groups--IDFA and MIF--who control the funds generated by mandatory assessments. For example, Alan Rosenfeld was hired from Public Voice to work as a lobbyist with M & R Strategic Services. He recently prepared a report for IDFA which was issued on IDFA letterhead. Since MIF and thus IDFA gets tons of money from mandatory assessments, does that free up some additional money to pay Alan Rosenfeld to write reports attacking the Compact or additional money to pay William Wasserman to lobby against the Compact? 
A list of the corporations that provide money to IDFA, MIF, and Public Voice would probably stun most dairy farmers who are trying to make a living through hard work. 
I am going to call for an investigation of these cozy arrangements with dairy lobbyists, USDA and industry front groups. These front groups who oppose the interests of dairy farmers should not control funds generated by mandatory assessments. 
A few days ago in the Record I addressed issues surrounding the intended extension of the Northeast Interstate Compact in the omnibus spending bill. I am gratified that this omnibus bill contains, as did the bill we already sent to the White House, such an extension in the provision extending the time to finalize milk marketing order reform. 
I am pleased that the Congress is not just going to provide additional income to corn, wheat, soybean and other farmers. Those farmers should be kept in business, but so should dairy farmers and the Compact does just that. Keeping the Compact in business until at least October 1, 1999, will greatly help dairy farmers in New England. 
The Dairy Compact has worked as we said it would. It keeps dairy farmers in business in bad times by giving them additional income. It also helps stabilize farm and consumer prices for milk. I only wish that all dairy farmers could get the additional income that the Compact brings, but Congress so far has only consented to the Northeast Compact. Under the first six months of the Compact, OMB reported that `New England dairy farm income rose by an estimated $22-27 million. . . .' 
The Interstate Dairy Compact Commission, with 26 delegates appointed by the six governors, is authorized to determine a `target price'--$16.94/cwt in this case. Under the Compact language, which is approved by the six states, any state can opt-out temporarily--until a later date that the state determines--or opt-in and receive that additional income for producers. The Compact is voluntary; it is up to each state whether to participate in any particular price regulation. 
As I just pointed out in this respect, when prices are low the effect of the Compact is similar to the loan deficiency payments made under marketing loan programs in that, roughly speaking, producers get the difference between a `capped' target amount and the 
current price. When farm prices are high, no cash payments are made to producers under the Compact. 
The reason the rate of loss of dairy farms in New England is now under control is that this additional income keeps their families on the farm. Dairy farmers are no less deserving than corn, wheat, soybean, or sorghum farmers. All farmers deserve to earn a decent income for their families. 
I mentioned that news articles have focused on how in Connecticut and Vermont the rate of farm loss is much less than before the Compact went into effect. Before the Compact, OMB reports that New England suffered a `20-percent decline' in the number of farms with milk cows from 1990 to 1996. Now this horrible rate of attrition has slowed. I have supported reasonable efforts to keep family farmers in business throughout our country. 
In addition, as I pointed out last week, the rate of milk consumption in New England is strong compared to the rest of the nation. Dairy farmers are making a decent living in New England and neighboring farmers are selling milk into the region to take advantage of the Compact. 
There is indeed a touch of hypocrisy in this farm crisis. Some, including some at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, see the loan deficiency payments as a great solution. If prices drop below a target price, the farmers get the difference between their market price and this target price. If prices increase above a certain level, then the farmers cannot receive this cash payment. 
As I said last week, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is an example of this. The major benefit of the Compact is to provide income to farmers when milk prices are low--income is not provided to farmers when prices rise past a certain point. The amount of the payment a farmer gets depends on how far milk prices are below the target price. You could simply repeat those two sentences but substitute the word `corn,' `soybeans' or `wheat,' or whichever commodity, for `milk' and you have described how the loan deficiency payment system works. 
But try to apply this system to milk prices and many Members of Congress and some in the Administration see dairy farmers as undeserving. Dairy is a major issue for ermont since more than 70 percent of all farm income is from dairy. This is why the Compact is crucial to us. 
I am pleased that OMB reported that after an initial increase in prices at stores just as the Compact was implemented that: `New England retail milk prices by December [the sixth month after implementation] returned to the historical relationship to national levels, being about $0.05 per gallon lower.' According to recent A.C. Neilson Corporation marketing research data, U.S. gallon sales of fluid milk are down 1.8 percent compared to one year ago. New England gallon sales of fluid milk, however, have decreased by only 0.7 percent. National sales of fluid milk have declined 1.1 percent more than New England sales of fluid milk. 
The Connecticut Agriculture Commissioner Shirley Ferris reports, `In June of 1997, the month before the Compact took effect, the average retail price for a gallon of whole milk was $2.72. This June, almost a year after the Compact took effect, the price for a gallon of whole milk is only $2.73. And the price of a gallon of 1% milk is even less expensive now than before the Compact--$.03 less per gallon than last June.' 
In order to keep farmers in business, I think most consumers would be willing to pay a little more for milk. In order to keep fresh, local supplies of milk I think most consumers would be willing to pay a little more to keep their local producers in business. 
Consumers know that if enough producers are forced out of farming, eventually milk prices could skyrocket. Countries around the world with inadequate numbers of dairy farmers pay huge prices for milk. 
I am pleased that under the Compact, and as confirmed by the OMB study, it is the producers of milk, the farmers, who get the increase in income under the Compact. If anyone doubts that the dairy farmers in New England did not get increased pay checks, someone should randomly call them on the phone and see if they really got the checks. I certainly have not heard complaints that the paychecks were lost in the mail. Even farmers in New York, which has not yet joined the Compact, are even getting higher paychecks. 
They are selling milk into the region to take advantage of the Compact. If Wisconsin or Minnesota switched places with New York State, farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota would do the same--sell into the Compact region to make more income. 
While I do not know for sure, I suspect that dairy producers in Wisconsin and Minnesota would like more income for all their hard labor. Vermont dairy farmers and neighboring New York dairy farmers sure do. 
Except for this benefit for neighboring farmers living just outside the Compact region, OMB reported that `New England has little effect on dairy markets outside its region, or on national prices or trends. . . . Its shipments outside the region in the form of cheese or milk are small.' To provide some perspective, I also wanted to mention that OMB reports that in 1996, `New England accounted for 2.93 percent of the Nation's milk production and 2.9 percent of its milk cows.' 
Corporate opponents of the Compact have tried to argue that this was a fight between consumers and farmers. The OMB study proves that consumer prices are lower in New England than the average for the rest of the country. So that is a false argument. 
The fight is actually between large manufacturers of milk products--large multinational corporations--and farmers. Manufacturers of any product, not just manufacturers of cheese or ice cream, want to buy their inputs as cheaply as possible. 
So why was there ever a concern about consumer prices increasing in the Compact region? Prices should have never increased. 
The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times discussed this in news articles about retail store price gouging. GAO raised the issue in 1991 and is looking at it now. 
We do know that retail prices for milk are often more than double what farmers get for their milk--nationwide. 
Think about that. 
Let's look at the time period just before the compact took effect--and pick Vermont as the sample state. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, in `Are Grocers Getting Fat by Overcharging for Milk?' beginning in November 1996, the price that farmers got for their milk dropped by almost 25 percent--35 cents or so per gallon. Store prices stayed high, which locked in a huge benefit to stores selling to consumers. Thirty-five cents a gallon is a significant increase in benefits to retail stores. 
Comparing November 1996 to June 1997, the price farmers received for their milk dropped 35 cents a gallon, and stayed low, but the prices that stores charged for milk stayed about the same. 
I have always pointed out that dairy compacts can help reduce this retail store price inflation by stabilizing the price that farmers get for milk, thus reducing the need for stores to build in a safety cushion to protect themselves in case it costs more for them to purchase milk. 
Without a compact, the price farmers get for their milk can vary significantly. These variations in price are passed through to stores by co-ops and other handlers. Yet stores prefer not to constantly change prices for customers so they build in a cushion. But this huge profit margin can be reduced by compacts which means that dairy compacts can both save consumers money and provide more income to farmers. 
Unfortunately, the OMB study is based on very limited information from USDA. USDA only gave OMB price information from six stores in New England--and only in two cities where it was announced in press accounts, in advance, that retail prices would go up even though store and wholesaler costs had dropped 35 cents per gallon. 
Even in light of this, OMB concluded that after six months, retail store prices in the compact region of New England were five cents lower than in the rest of the nation. 
New England newspaper accounts of the implementation of the Compact were very interesting. For example, the July 1, 1997, edition of the Portland Press Herald from Portland, Maine points out that `Cumberland Farms increased the price of whole milk by four cents but dropped the price of skim by a penny' when the Compact was implemented. 
Also, they note that `At Hannaford's Augusta store, Hood milk--a brand-name product--was selling for $2.63 a gallon, while the Hannaford store brand was selling for $2.32.' 
Also, `Shaw's increased its price by about 20 cents a gallon in [parts of] the five other New England states but kept the price the same here [in Maine].' 
The June 26, 1997, Boston Globe and the June 27, Providence Journal pointed out before the Compact was implemented that one of the chains signaled a price increase. A spokesman for Shaw's Supermarkets, Bernard Rogan, is quoted as saying that milk prices will go up next week. 
The June 30, Boston Globe reported that, `The region's major supermarkets are raising their milk prices 20 cents a gallon, ignoring arguments that their profit margins are big enough to absorb a new price subsidy for New England dairy farmers that takes effect this week.' 
As OMB discovered after six months, this initial signaled increase was subjected to competitive pressures and that consumer prices in New England came down. 
However, even if it took a slight increase in supermarket prices to keep farmers in business, I think that is worth it. If a lot of dairy farmers cannot make a living then eventually dairy prices will go way up, just as in a number of foreign countries. 
Also, as I pointed out recently in the Record, studies of prices charged in stores in Vermont, for example, show that the most important factor in the price of milk is the brand and the store. In cities and towns in Vermont, the variation in price among stores was in the 50 cents to one dollar range. In other words, in the same town the price of a gallon of milk varied greatly and still does. These store variations, and variations through the use of store coupons, dwarf any possible impact of the Compact. 
All other food expenditures dwarf how much income consumers spend on fluid milk. The savings consumers can achieve through buying `on sale' or house-brand items, or through using discount coupons, far exceed typical changes in the price of fluid milk. Only 3 percent of the average household's total expenditures on food go for fluid milk. This information is from an article titled `Food Cost Review,' 1995, from the Economic Research Service of U.S.D.A. 
Farmers, consumers and processors all need fair prices. Processors should not have received huge profits at the expense of the other two. I will continue to monitor these abuses by MIF and IDFA detailed by the IG. I greatly appreciate the work of the Roger Viadero, the Inspector General, on this issue and on other issues he has handled. He is doing an outstanding job along with his staff at USDA.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been a long road to get us where we are today to a modification of the unfair Medicare home health interim payment system (IPS) reimbursement that passed last year as part of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA). Making sure that this change was passed this year was not about politics but about helping those with the most to lose, the seniors and disabled Americans who rely on home health care. 
At the beginning of this year, when I discussed with my colleagues a problem with the `Medicare Home Health IPS,' I received a lot of blank stares. The rising level of understanding about this problem--and the rising level of support to fix it--was a commendable and effective team effort on the part of home health beneficiaries and their care givers. They were able to explain to their representatives in Congress why the short-term tinkering in health policy that created the IPS was unfair and was done with too little thought for the consequences. 
The IPS passed last year sought to reduce overall spending on home health care by eliminating fraud, waste and abuse to preserve the benefit for those who truly need it. But as Vermont providers know all too well, there were unintended consequences of this proposal that severely harmed their ability to provide care to the most vulnerable populations. 
Under this faulty system, Vermont's 13 non-profit home health agencies predicted millions of dollars in reduced payments this year while already boasting the lowest average Medicare costs in the country. The skewed thinking behind the IPS created a system under which Vermont was punished for its low-cost, efficient provision of home health care while high-cost, inefficient providers were rewarded. 
A year ago this month, my office began to receive phone calls and letters from Vermont home health beneficiaries and their care givers who were beginning to understand what the overwhelming impact of the new IPS would be. In an effort to raise this issue to the level of where we are today, concerned senators and representatives began the drum beat of highlighting this as a critical issue that must have relief this year. 
From the beginning there was a lot of reluctance by the congressional leadership to take up any Medicare legislation this year. 
The home health agencies in my state were relentless in their efforts to continue to call attention to the fundamental unfairness of the Medicare IPS that punished their prudent and efficient provision of service to Vermonters. 
My staff and I met with home health officials, and we agreed early on that any and all pressure that we could put on the Administration and other members of Congress would be critical to ensuring the ability of home health care providers to meet the needs of Vermonters. 
Several bipartisan Senate bills were introduced over the past year, the first being one sponsored by Senators Kennedy, Kerry, Jeffords and myself. We knew at the time that this was not the perfect answer but that we needed to start a process to get the ball rolling. 
Subsequently, several other bills were introduced which I also cosponsored, most notably by Senator Collins and another by Senator Grassley. I also joined Senator Bond in offering an amendment in the Appropriations Committee which we withdrew once we were assured that the Republican leadership was taking this issue seriously and would deal with it separately. My colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, has pushed hard for this solution as a member of the Finance Committee. 
I applaud the bipartisan nature of the work to get this situation turned around. The beneficiaries, the agencies which serve them, and Members of Congress continued to press until we found some relief from the fundamental unfairness in the payment system for home health care. 
The Omnibus Appropriations Act conference agreement passed today makes necessary changes to the IPS payment system for the Medicare's home health care benefit. In short, the agreement is expected to provide some equity to agencies which have low-cost, low-utilization practices relative to other agencies by increasing the per beneficiary limits. Agencies below the national median per beneficiary limit will have their limit increased by one-third of the difference between their limit and the national median. The agreement also delays the implementation of the prospective payment system (PPS) until October 1, 2000, and delays an across-the-board 15 percent reduction in payments to home health agencies until that date. 
Like most contentious issues, this fix does not go as far as I would have liked and as far as I believe efficient providers like those in Vermont deserve. I support it however because it is better than the status quo. 
In the longer term, we need to stop ignoring a more fundamental problem. Congress needs to address the long-term health care needs of the American people. 
Stepping back to understanding why the IPS was passed last year, we can see that it was in recognition of the difficulty of designing a more permanent PPS for Medicare home health reimbursement, coupled with the need to immediately control spending. 
In the long term, a well-designed PPS will provide the Medicare program with the best means to control home health spending and address the problems Vermont home care agencies, and other agencies around the country that are able to provide quality, low-cost care. 
The BBA requires implementation of a PPS by agencies in FY 2000. The PPS would establish a fixed, predetermined payment per unit of service, adjusted for patient characteristics that affect the cost of care. Under a well-designed PPS system, efficient providers would be financially rewarded. Conversely, inefficient ones would need to better control their costs to remain viable. If a PPS is not properly implemented, Medicare will not save money, cost-control incentives will at best be weak, and access to and quality of care could suffer. 
I am committed to working with my colleagues to make sure that we work steadfastly in overcoming any hurdles in developing a well-designed PPS so that we do not find ourselves in the same situation that we found ourselves with the IPS.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, H.R. 3633, `The Controlled Substances Trafficking Prohibition Act,' addresses a gap in our controlled substances laws. At present, people entering the United States from Mexico may bring up to a ninety-day supply of drug products into the country without a prescription, under the so-called `personal use' exemption. Many of these drug products are then illegally distributed within the United States. 
Such abuses have increased dramatically in recent years, and there is a need to address this problem now. H.R. 3633 does this by limiting the personal use exemption in certain circumstances to 50 dosage units. But this is only a stopgap measure. What constitutes `personal use' is a complicated issue that will turn on a number of circumstances, including the nature of the controlled substance and the medical needs of the individual. It is the sort of issue that should be addressed not through single-standard legislation but through measures regulations passed by an agency with expertise in the matter. For this reason, I believe that we will have to take this issue up again next year, to direct the Department of Justice to study the problems at our borders and to pass regulations that are more finely-tuned to address those problems. In the meantime, H.R. 3633 will help to stem the tide of illegal importations of controlled drugs, which pose dangers to Americans when illegally distributed and used.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that the House Republican leadership relented and after several days' delay allowed the House to consider and adopt the conference report on the landmark Digital Millennium Copyright Act, H.R. 2281. 
Just two weeks ago, the Senate unanimously passed the Conference Report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, H.R. 2281. This important legislation is based on the implementing legislation recommended by the Administration and introduced last year by Senators Hatch, Thompson, Kohl and me, to implement the new World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) copyright treaties. The bill provides the protection necessary to encourage copyright owners to make their works available over the Internet and in other digital formats. This legislation sets a standard for other nations who must also implement these treaties. 
The Senate bill was reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed the Senate without opposition. The House-Senate conference over the last several weeks also led to all conferees signing the conference report and supporting the final version of the legislation. As the only Senate Democratic conferee I was pleased to serve on this conference and participate in working out agreements with House Republican and Democratic conferees. 
With the approval of the chairmen and ranking Democrats on both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Commerce Committee, this landmark legislation--which Senator Hatch has called the most important bill we will pass this year--seemed to have finally cleared the last hurdle and be ready to be sent to the President for enactment. On Thursday, October 8, Senator Hatch and I were both present on the Senate floor for Senate final passage and had been informed that the House leadership had determined to take up and pass the bill that very day. 
Surprisingly, the bill was not taken up in the House on Thursday or Friday or Saturday or Sunday. There was a threat that it would not be brought up by the House leadership at all, and I think that the Senate and the American people are entitled to an explanation. 
It turns out that the House Republican leadership had decided to hold this critical legislation hostage to petty partisan politics. According to reports in Roll Call on October 8 and 12, Reuters on October 10 and the Washington Post on October 14 and 15, House Republicans were mad that a pal of theirs was not hired to head the Electronic Industries Alliance. The hold on this legislation is to `send a message.' 
Apparently, in the world of Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, trade associations better hire their Republican friends or there will be retribution, including stalling action of important bipartisan legislation that promotes the national interest. This is childish behavior beneath the dignity of those who hold leadership positions in a House of Congress. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a good bill on which so many of us have worked so hard and cooperated so closely across the aisle, was finally allowed to be considered by the House and did pass. I thank the House Republican leaders for ending their pout in time for this landmark legislation to be adopted. 
This bill should help create jobs and economic opportunities to America's leading copyright-based industries. We all recognize that because the U.S. is the world-wide leader in intellectual property, the U.S. will be the main beneficiary if Congress enacts this legislation. 
Protecting and encouraging the intellectual creations of our citizens has always been a fundamental priority for our country and a responsibility of our national government. Our creative industries produce the material that makes the global information infrastructure something worth having. I want to ensure that the creators of movies and television and cable programming and recordings and books and computer software and interactive media continue to create, that their creativity is rewarded, that their creations are not stolen or pirated, and that those basic tenets are followed in all the world's markets. 
The 1998 report of the International Intellectual Property Alliance confirms the importance of copyright-based industries to our American economy and our economic future. The report demonstrates, for the seventh straight year, that the U.S. copyright industries continue to be one of the largest and fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy. These industries are leading this country into the digital age and the 21st century. Thanks goodness cooler heads finally prevailed and Congress was allowed to complete work on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long been involved in high technology issues and those affecting American industry that relies on intellectual property at its core. Over a decade ago, I helped establish and chaired a Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Technology and the Law. This year, we have successfully completed work on legislation to address the impending millennium bug with the Senate and House adopting the Hatch-Leahy substitute for S. 2392, the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. 
I have also worked closely with Senator Hatch on a number of other intellectual property measure including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, H.R. 2281, the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act, S. 2193, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office Reauthorization Act, H.R. 3723. Working with Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Boxer, Harkin, Kohl and others, we have been able to put the interests of the nation and the nation's economic future first and enact significant legislation with respect to both copyright and trademark matters this year. Unfortunately, we have not made the progress that we should have on patent matters. 
A critical matter from the intellectual property agenda, important to the nation's economic future, is reform of our patent laws. I have been working diligently along with Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, Harkin and Lieberman to get the Omnibus Patent Act, S. 507, considered and passed by the Senate. It is an important measure to America's future. Working in tandem with Senator Hatch, we developed a good bill that was reported to the Senate by a vote of 17 to one over a year ago. 
We have been seeking Senate consideration and a vote for more than a year, but Republican objections have prevented its passage. Last month, I signed on to offer our patent bill as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I felt strongly that it was long past time for the Senate to consider this patent reform legislation. Unfortunately, Republican opposition, again, prevented Senate consideration and prevented the amendment from even being offered. 
I deeply regret that Republican objections succeeded in preventing Senator Hatch from even offering our amendment, in spite of the amendment spot that we had reserved for that purpose. I know that there is strong support for this measure and I know that no Senate Democrat has been preventing or objecting to its consideration. 
Anonymous Senate Republican have prevented the patent bill from being given the opportunity to be debated. This is not the way for the Senate to act. Republican objections killed patent reform silently, without fingerprints, and without debate. 
I want to thank Secretary Daley and the Administration for their unfailing support of effective patent reform. Our patent bill would be good for Vermont, good for American innovators of all sizes, and good for America. Unfortunately, some secret minority of Senate Republicans will not allow patent reform to proceed. 
The patent bill would reform the U.S. patent system in important ways. It would reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; eliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate research into new areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and commercialization of inventions. 
Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, reaching back to the Johnson Administration, have supported these reforms. Last year, five former Patent Commissioners sent a letter to the President and to the members of the Senate supporting the patent reform bill. 
Senator Hatch and I agreed to incorporate suggestions from the White House Conference on Small Businesses and I am pleased to report that as a result, the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the National Venture Capital Association, National Small Business United, and the Small Business Technology Coalition concluded that the bill would be of great benefit to small businesses. 
Unfortunately, because of Republican opposition to this bipartisan bill, the Senate will have no opportunity to consider this legislation to assist U.S. inventors small and large. I find this particularly unfortunate since our patent bill was geared toward improving the operational efficiency at the PTO and making government smaller and leaner. 
Today's inventors and creators can be much like those of Thomas Jefferson's day--individuals in a shop, garage or home lab. They can also be teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at our colleges and universities. Our nation's patent laws should be fair to American innovators of all kinds--independent inventors, small businesses, venture capitalists and larger corporations. To maintain America's preeminence in the realm of technology we need to modernize our patent system and patent office. Our inventors know this and that is why they support this legislation. 
I have received many letters of endorsements for S. 507, some of which I placed into the Congressional Record on June 23, July 10 and July 16, from the following coalitions and companies: the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National Venture Capital Association, the 21st Century Patent Coalition, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of American (PhRMA), the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Software Publishers Association, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Business Software Alliance, the American Electronics Association, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the International Trademark Association, IBM, 3M, Intel, Caterpillar, AMP, and Hewlett-Packard. In addition, I have letters of support from the National Association of Manufacturers, TSM/Rockwell International, Obsidian, and Allied Signal. 
I am deeply disappointed that the Senate is being prevented from considering this important legislation by Republican recalcitrance. American inventors deserve better and America's future is being short changed.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the House has now passed the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. The premise for this federal law is a workable and protective federal standard. Throughout the legislative process, we have been careful to ensure that the pleading standard rules developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit would continue to govern. The Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress, which have worked together on this legislation, have all agreed on that standard. As the Conference Report and Statement of Managers makes clear, the recklessness standard and Second Circuit pleading rules continue in force. Indeed, the managers reiterated that the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act reinforced these standards, which continue to govern under the 1998 Act, as well. As a member of the Judiciary Committee and serving now as its ranking member, I am well aware that artificially high pleading standards could create unwanted and unneeded barriers to legitimate cases. That is not the intent of this legislation and should not be its effect.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the digitization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. This bill, S. 2107, will make the United States government more accessible and accountable to the citizenry by directing federal agencies to accept `electronic signatures' for government forms that are submitted electronically. 
I am pleased that Senator Abraham has addressed my concerns about the privacy issues raised by this legislation. As reported out of committee, S. 2107 would have established a framework for government use of electronic signatures without putting in place any privacy protections for the vast amounts of personal information collected in the process. Without such protections, people could be forced to sacrifice their privacy as the price of communicating with the government electronically. 
For example, to submit a particular form electronically, a person might be required to use an electronic signature technology that offers a high level of security, such as the increasingly popular cryptographic digital signature. This will usually involve the use of a commercial third party--we'll call it `X Corp.'--to guarantee the person's identity. X Corp. will need to collect detailed personal information about the person, such as home address, phone number, social security number, date of birth, and even credit information. Some of the most secure systems even collect biometric information such as fingerprints or handwritten signatures. X Corp. might also collect information about how the person uses electronic signature services, amassing a detailed dossier of the person's activities on-line. Nothing in the original bill prevented X Corp. from using or selling such private information without permission. 
We have corrected this oversight by adding forward-looking privacy protections to the amendment, which strictly limit the ways in which information collected as a byproduct of electronic communications with the government can be used or disclosed to others. The provision we have crafted is designed to prevent anyone who collects personal information in the course of providing electronic signatures for use with government agencies from inappropriately disclosing that information. 
We recognize that this is just the beginning of Congress's efforts to address the new privacy issues raised by electronic government and the information age. Congress will almost certainly be called upon in the next session to consider broader electronic signature legislation, and issues of law enforcement access to electronic data and mechanisms for enforcing privacy rights in cyberspace will need to be part of that discussion. For the time being, however, this legislation will ensure that Americans can interact with their government on-line, and that they can do so with the necessary safeguards in place to protect their privacy and security.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering the `Plant Patent Amendments Act of 1998,' H.R. 1197. This legislation closes a loophole in the law by providing patent protection, not only for an entire plant, but for parts of a plant as well. 
Since the 1930s, U.S. patent law has benefited agriculture, horticulture and the public by providing an incentive for breeders to develop new plant varieties. This incentive is the availability of patents for new plant varieties. 
An unforeseen ambiguity in the law, however, is undermining the incentives for breeders holding U.S. plant patents. Because current U.S. law only provides patent protection for entire plants, plant parts are being traded in U.S. markets to the detriment of U.S. plant patent holders. The resulting lost royalty income has been inhibiting investment in domestic research and breeding activities associated with a wide variety of crops. 
By clearly and explicitly providing that U.S. patent law protects the owner of a plant patent against the unauthorized sale of plant parts taken from plants illegally reproduced, H.R. 1197 will close the existing loophole in the law and will strengthen the ability of U.S. plant patent holders to enforce their patent rights. 
Another matter of special interest to me is the amendment that I offered to the `Plant Patent Amendments Act of 1998' to enhance access to all types of patent information. I have long thought that electronic access should be more widespread and want to work with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to ensure the effective implementation of statewide electronic accessibility of patent information in rural states and eventually in all areas to make it easier for inventors to study prior art and make further advances. This should be of particular benefit to Vermont, which last year established a patent and trademark depository library. 
The Articles of Association of the Vermont Patent and Trademark Depository Library (Vermont PTDL) state that the library will `create a vital educational and economic development resource that will provide all Vermonters with access to patent and trademark records and supporting research materials and reference services.' At this time, however, all Vermonters do not, in a practical sense, have access to the wealth of resources at the Vermont PTDL. In fact, it can be as much as a four hour drive for certain Vermont citizens to drive to the Vermont PTDL at the University of Vermont's Bailey/Howe Library. 
The intent of my amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, is for the PTO to work with the people in the trenches currently operating the patent and trademark depository libraries to develop and implement the statewide computer networks with remote library sites; it only makes sense for the PTO to work with the people who most fully understand the needs of the constituents they currently serve and may serve in the future. 
This legislation is timely, because the Senate is considering the United States Patent and Trademark Office Reauthorization Act, Fiscal Year 1999, H.R. 3723. As the lead Senate Democratic champion for H.R. 3723, I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this measure today so the PTO will not suffer a reduction in revenue for the current fiscal year. I am also committed to working with the PTO, now and in the future, as it ensures the effective implementation of statewide electronic accessibility of patent information in rural states. 
I would like to pay a special thanks to Eric Benson, President of Vermont PTDL, former State representative Kerry Kurt, who was instrumental in the development of the Vermont PTDL, and everybody who serves on the Board of the Vermont PTDL. These Vermonters were the inspiration for my amendment, and they have worked hard to make the Vermont PTDL an asset of which all Vermonters can be proud.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the United States Patent and Trademark Office Reauthorization Act, Fiscal Year 1999, H.R. 3723. This bill, which passed the House of Representatives on May 12, 1998, is an important measure that would benefit all American inventors and would, for the first time in the history of the U.S. patent system, reduce patent fees. 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is totally funded by user fees. Prior to 1990, the PTO was funded through a combination of user fees and taxpayer revenue. However, in a deficit reduction exercise in 1990, taxpayer support for the operations of the PTO was eliminated and user fees were substantially increased by the imposition of a surcharge on patent fees. The temptation to use the surcharge has proven to be increasingly irresistible to Congress and the Administration, to the detriment of sound functioning of our nation's patent system. Through Fiscal Year 1998, a total of $235 million has been diverted from the PTO to other unrelated agencies and programs. 
At the urging of the inventor community, Congress allowed the surcharge to sunset at the end of Fiscal Year 1998. This means, however, that Congress must take affirmative action to adjust patent fees or the PTO will suffer a drastic reduction in revenue for the current fiscal year which will leave it unable to hire the patent examiners needed to reduce the time required to get a patent to eighteen months. Prompt processing of patent applications is particularly important for those inventors who need their patents to raise risk capital. 
The Administration forwarded a draft bill to the Congress which would have continued patent fees at the current levels. However, in an oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Commissioner Lehman stated that the PTO would be unable to use all the revenues that would be generated if patent fees were to be continued at their current level in fiscal year 1999. Commissioner Lehman stated that keeping fees at their current level would generate $50 million in excess fee revenue which the Administration planned to divert to other government programs. The response by the House of Representatives was to craft a bill, H.R. 3723, that would adjust patent fees to provide all of the money which the PTO indicated that it could use in fiscal year 1999, but which would not generate an unneeded $50 million simply to support other government programs. 
In the absence of any action on H.R. 3723, Congress had to include specific language in the continuing resolution signed by the President on September 25, 1998 addressing the level of patent fees that the PTO could charge. Section 117 of Public Law 105-240 provides that the PTO can continue to charge patent fees at the same level that existed on September 30, 1998 through October 9, 1998. As I previously noted, patent fees at this level are higher than they need to be to fully fund the PTO in fiscal year 1999. In a fiscal year when there are debates over how to use the billions of dollars of budget surplus, it is inappropriate for Congress to require the PTO to charge inventors more than the cost of rendering the services which they receive. By enacting H.R. 3723 we serve American inventors and provide them with the first real patent fee reduction in the history of the nation. This bill is good for American inventors and good for the United States.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Friday, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my good friend from Utah, spoke on the floor about juvenile justice legislation. He indicated that he will be urging the Majority Leader to make this issue one of the top legislative priorities in the 106th Congress. It is indeed unfortunate that the Senate has failed to consider legislation in this important area. 
Improving our Nation's juvenile justice system and preventing juvenile delinquency has strong bipartisan support in Congress and in the White House. That is why I and other Democrats have introduced juvenile crime legislation both at the beginning and the end of this Congress. Within the first weeks of the 105th Congress, I joined Senator Daschle in introducing the `Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997,' S. 15, and last month introduced, with the support of Senators Daschle, Biden and other Democratic members, the `Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,' S. 2484. That is why the Administration transmitted juvenile crime legislation, the `Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act of 1997,' S. 362, which I introduced with Senator Biden on the Administration's behalf in February 1997. 
Given the strong interest in this issue from both sides of the aisle, the failure of the Senate to consider juvenile crime legislation would appear puzzling. Indeed, the House passed juvenile justice legislation three times this year, when it sent to the Senate H.R. 3 on May 8, 1997, H.R. 1818 on July 15, 1997, and both these bills again attached to S. 2073 on September 15, 1998. The Senate juvenile crime bill, S. 10, was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997, and then left to languish for over a year. 
The Republicans have never called up S. 10 for consideration by the full Senate. Instead, in early September they rushed to the floor with no warning and offered terms for bringing up the bill that would have significantly limited debate and amendments on the many controversial items in the bill. For example, although the substitute juvenile crime bill that the Republicans wanted to debate contained over 160 changes from the Committee-reported bill, the majority wished to limit Democratic amendments to five. This offer was unacceptable, as the Republicans well knew before they ever offered it. 
We should recognize this offer for what it is: a procedural charade engaged in by the Republicans in a feeble effort to place the blame on the minority for the majority's failure to bring up juvenile justice legislation in the Senate. Nevertheless, I suggested a plan for a full and fair debate on S. 10. On September 25, 1998, I put in the record a proposal that would have limited the amendments offered by Democrats to the most controversial aspects of the bill, such as restoring the core protection for juvenile status offenders to keep them out of jail, keeping juveniles who are in custody separated from adult inmates, and ensuring adequate prevention funding. 
I never heard back from the Republicans. They simply ignored my proposal, and failed to turn to this issue again on the floor of the Senate. These facts make clear that assertions about Democrats refusing proposals to limit the number of amendments to S. 10, and refusing to permit a conference on House-passed legislation, could not be farther from the truth. Indeed, no proposal to agree to a conference was ever propounded on the floor of the Senate. 
During the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at hearings on numerous occasions about my concerns with S. 10, including on November 13, 1997, January 29, 1998, April 1, 1998, June 23, 1998, and September 8, 1998. On each of those occasions, I expressed my willingness to work with the Chairman in a bipartisan manner to improve this bill. Since Committee consideration of the bill, I have continued to raise the areas of concern that went unaddressed in the Committee-reported bill. Specifically, I was concerned that the bill skimped on effective prevention efforts to stop children from getting into trouble in the first place. 
Second, I was concerned that the bill would gut the core protections, which have been in place for over 20 years to protect children that come into contact with the criminal justice system and keep them out of harm's way from adult inmates, to keep status and nonoffenders out of jail altogether, and to address disproportionate minority confinement. 
Third, I was concerned about the federalization of juvenile crime due to S. 10's elimination of the requirement that federal courts may only get involved in prosecutions of juveniles for offenses with which the federal government has concurrent jurisdiction with the State, if the State cannot or declines to prosecute the juvenile. 
Finally, I was concerned the new accountability block grant in S. 10 contained onerous eligibility requirements that would end up imposing on the States a one-size-fits-all uniform sewn-up in Washington for dealing with juvenile crime. I know many States viewed this bill as a straight-jacket, which is why it was opposed by the National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties and the Council of State Governments. 
Unfortunately, productive negotiations on this bill did not commence in earnest until the final days of this Congress. The fact that negotiations began at all is due in no small part to the efforts and leadership of Representatives Bill McCollum, Charles Schumer, Frank Riggs, Bobby Scott and John Conyers. They and their staffs have worked tirelessly on this issue and to address many of the concerns that were raised about the juvenile crime legislation. 
Over the past week, I have worked with Senators Hatch, Sessions, Biden, Kennedy, Kohl, Feingold and Bingaman, and our House counterparts, to craft bipartisan legislation that could be passed in the final days of this Congress. While our last-minute efforts to complete action on this bill were unsuccessful, I appreciate the good faith in which these bipartisan, bicameral negotiations took place and recognize the important compromises that were offered on all sides. Time ran out in this Congress to get our job done on this legislation. 
I appreciate the frustration of many of my Republican colleagues about our inability to achieve consensus on juvenile justice legislation because I know that those frustrations are shared by me and my Democratic colleagues. It is unfortunate that the majority did not chose to begin these negotiations, and did not chose to start addressing the significant criticisms of this bill, until the last minutes of this Congress. 
When the 106th Congress convenes, and we again turn our attention to juvenile justice legislation, my hope is that the good work we have accomplished over the last week is the starting point. If not, I fear that the 106th Congress will end up at the same place we are today: with no juvenile justice legislation to show as an accomplishment for all of us. I thank all who have been willing to make the effort in the final days, and look forward to completing this work early next year.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we approach the close of the 105th Congress, it is time to take stock of our accomplishments, and reflect on the work that remains. When the environmental record of this Congress is tallied up, there won't be much to show. At best, we have avoided a great roll-back of environmental protections. We can't claim to have broken much new ground. 
To her credit, Carol Browner and her staff at the Environmental Protection Agency have tried to push ahead in a very difficult political climate. Administrator Browner recently announced that EPA was ordering 22 Eastern states to make sharp cuts in emissions of the pollutants that result in summertime ozone pollution. A significant portion of these pollutants come from coal-fired power plants. The predictable howl from the utility companies and their lobbyists is being heard on Capitol Hill. I applaud Administrator Browner and her staff for their persistence on this important issue. 
Even though this is a good step, it doesn't go far enough. Stronger, more comprehensive action is needed to finally address the whole gamut of air pollution problems that spew from power plant smoke stacks. 
Taken collectively, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute the largest source of air pollution in the United States. It is clear by now that the current Clean Air Act and its regulations are not up to the job of addressing the local, regional and global public health and environmental burdens imposed by the emissions from these plants. Congress took a big step to control air pollution with the Clean Air Act of 1970, and it did major rewrites of the Act in 1977 and 1990. Even with all this legislation on the books, most fossil fuel-fired power plants produce as much pollution as they did prior to 1970. The average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the United States came into operation in 1964--six years before the 1970 Act. Seventy-seven percent of the fossil fuel generating units in operation in the United States began operation before the 1970 Clean Air Act was implemented, and are thus not subject to the full force of its regulations. 
At the very heart of the environmental problems posed by this industry are the antiquated and inefficient combustion technologies that are used. Nothing in the Clean Air Act, or in other energy related statues, tackles this inefficiency. The average plant uses technology devised in the 1950's or before, and has a combustion efficiency of 33%. Put another way, 67% of the energy available in the fuel is wasted. When you get so little energy out of the fuel, you have to burn a lot more fuel to produce a given quantity of electricity. The more fuel you burn, the more pollution you get. Increasing efficiency is the only way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and burning less fuel will result in smaller amounts of all pollutants. 
Burning all this fuel may be good for the bottom line of the companies that produce the coal, oil, and natural gas, but it imposes great environmental and health consequences on the rest of us. Many of my colleagues came to the Senate after successful business careers. I imagine that most would agree with me that any other business that was this wasteful would not survive for long. 
To produce the power that our economy needs, some level of emissions is inevitable. But this inefficiency, coupled with the free ride on emissions that the pre-1970 plants get, exacts an enormous environmental cost. Consider the following power plant facts: 
Every year, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States produced a staggering 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, the primary `greenhouse gas,' the equivalent weight of 24,655 Washington Monuments. 
Over 600 of these generating units produce over one million tons of carbon dioxide per year--two produce more than 9 million tons per year. 
On average, coal plants emit over 2,100 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity that is generated. 
Coal-fired power plants emit at least 52 tons of mercury per year and are the leading source of mercury pollution in the United States. 
Power plants emit particulate and urban ozone pollution that impair respiratory function in people with asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory ailments. 
Power plant emissions result in acid deposition, which damages lakes, streams and rivers, and the plants and animals that depend on them for survival. 
Technology exists that can raise power plant efficiencies to 35% to 50% above current levels. The question is how to get utilities to retire their inefficient processes and bring new, clean, and efficient ones on line. We can see a better future, but we don't have a clear path to get there. 
Today, I am introducing the `Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1998' to help us get to the other side. My goals with this legislation are to chart a sensible and balanced course for the future that: protects public health and the environment; protects consumers, workers, and the economy; and provides electrical power producers with a clear set of achievable performance expectations and financial incentives for installing new, clean, and efficient electrical power generating capacity that will meet our needs into the 21st Century. 
This industry plays a central role in the U.S. economy and in our daily lives. We expect that electrical service will be reliable, predictable and affordable. We flip on the switch without giving a second thought that the light will go on. My bill will not change that. 
Major changes cannot be made over night. We know about inertia From Sir Isaac Newton's First Law of Motion that `any object in a state of rest or uniform linear motion will remain in such a state unless acted upon by an external force.' The inertia in the utility industry to continue business as usual is overwhelming. The old, inefficient, pollution-prone power plants will continue to operate in perpetuity because they are paid for, they burn the cheapest fuel, and they are subject to less stringent environmental requirements. 
My bill provides an `external force' in the form of financial and regulatory incentives to prompt modernization that is beneficial for the environment and the economy. It provides industry decision-makers with a comprehensive and predictable set of requirements and incentives to guide their long-term business planning. 
For investor-owned utilities, the bill provides accelerated depreciation tax incentives for plants that meet the efficiency goals. Under current tax law, new generating capacity is depreciated over a 20 year period. Under my bill, new capacity that meets a 45% efficiency level would be depreciated over a 15 year period, and new capacity that meets a 50% efficiency level would be depreciated over a 10 year period. Publicly owned utilities would be eligible for grants that have the equivalent monetary value of the depreciation benefit received by a similarly-situated investor-owned utility. This approach will spur innovation, and will reward utilities that aggressively move to increase their efficiency and reduce their emissions. 
To pay for these incentives and to achieve this within the balanced budget constraints, my bill establishes a fee that would be levied on carbon dioxide emissions. The emission fees would also provide funds: for worker retraining for individuals adversely affected by reduced consumption of coal; community redevelopment funds; research and development for renewable technologies such as wind, solar, and biomass; development of a carbon sequestration strategy; and implementing carbon sequestration projects including soil restoration, tree planting, preservation of wetlands, and other ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide. 
I want to work cooperatively with the power companies on this legislation, and I want to work with my colleagues from coal-producing states to minimize the impact of reduced coal consumption on mine workers and mining communities. I also want to work with my colleagues on the Committees that are taking up utility restructuring legislation to ensure that this industry, whether in its current form or in a restructured form, finally comes to terms with the environmental costs of its operations. 
While the 105th Congress may not have much of an environmental record to brag about, pressure is mounting to dramatically reduce the environmental impact from fossil fuel fired power plants. The people of Vermont are willing, I look forward to working hard in the first session of the 106th Congress to enact this much needed and long-overdue piece of legislation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was proud to cosponsor the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996 and am again proud to cosponsor this bill, S. 1525, the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act of 1998. I am delighted that the Senate is finally sending this important bill to the President's desk for his signature into law. 
Our legislation extends the educational benefits that we previously provided to the children of federal law enforcement to the families of State and local public safety officials who die or are disabled in the line of duty. Those families make the ultimate sacrifice for our public safety and deserve our support and assistance. I commend Senator Specter and Senator Biden and all the cosponsors for their work on these measures. 
The Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996, known as the Degan Act after U.S. Deputy Marshall Bill Degan, who died in the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992, provides Federal educational assistance to families of Federal law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. It is proper that we expand this educational assistance to the families of state and local law enforcement officers because most law enforcement needs are met at the state and local level. I would have preferred to send the President the original text of our legislation since it provided full assistance to these families, but the House of Representatives decided to impose a sliding scale means test to our bill. 
This past May, I called for Congress to pass this legislation during National Police Week and the annual memorial activities for law enforcement officers. I believe it would have been a fitting tribute to those who gave their lives in preserving our public safety for Congress to enact the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act, S. 1525; the Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, S. 1985; and the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, S. 1605. Fortunately, President Clinton signed the Bulletproof Vests Partnership Act and the Care for Police Survivors Act into law on June 16, 1998 and now he will have the opportunity to sign into law this third piece of legislation. Together these measures make a significant package of legislation to benefit the families of those who serve in law enforcement. 
The unfortunate reality of contemporary life is that we may still lose upwards of 100 law enforcement officers a year nationwide. I wish there were none and I will keep working to improve the assistance and support we provide our law enforcement officers. For those families that sacrifice a loved one in the line of duty I support the college education assistance that will be made possible by the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act. I look forward to the President signing this important legislation into law.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have been able to work with the Senator from Utah to gain passage of this important legislation, the Improvements to International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998. It will give United States law enforcement agencies important tools to help them combat international crime. 
Unfortunately, recent incidents have made amply clear that crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American interests abroad are part of our modern reality. The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are just the most recent reminders of how vulnerable American citizens and interests are to terrorist attacks. In a shockingly brutal attack, more than 250 men, women and children, were murdered in cold blood. Among those 250 victims were 12 of our fellow citizens. 
With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with ease. They can transfer funds with a push of a button, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens and businesses from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans here and abroad. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with it. 
This bill does exactly that, not with sweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by law enforcement. The bill gives tools and protection to investigators and prosecutors, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international criminals and terrorists now enjoy. 
I initially introduced certain provisions of this bill on April 30, 1998, in the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prisons Act of 1998, S. 2011, with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein, and Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden, on behalf of the Administration, the International Crime Control Act of 1998, S. 2303, which contains many of the provisions set forth in this bill. Virtually all of the provisions in the bill were included in another major anti-crime bill, the `Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998,' that I introduced on September 16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, and Torricelli. 
We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete improvements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions may be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law enforcement priority. 
The bill would provide discretionary authority for investigations and prosecutions of organized crime groups that kill or threaten violence against Americans abroad, when in the view of the Attorney General, the organized crime group was trying to further its objectives. This should not be viewed as an invitation for American law enforcement officers to start investigating organized crime around the world, but when such groups are targeting Americans abroad for physical violence and the Attorney General believes it is necessary, we must act. 
In addition, the bill would expand current law to criminalize murder and other serious crimes committed against state and local officials who are working abroad with federal authorities on joint projects or operations. The penalties for murder against such state or local officials, who are acting abroad under the auspices of the federal government, are the same as for federal officers, under section 1119 of title 18, United States Code, and would therefore authorize imposition of the death penalty. While I oppose the death penalty, there is no reason to distinguish the penalties for murder of federal versus non-federal officials, who are both acting under the auspices of the Federal Government. 
Also, the authority of the Attorney General to bring such prosecutions is limited so as not to interfere with the criminal jurisdiction of the foreign nation where the murder occurred. Thus, I would expect this authority to be exercised only in the rare circumstance in which the Attorney General believes the foreign country is not adequately addressing the crime. 
The bill contains provisions to protect our maritime borders by providing realistic sanctions for vessels that fail to `heave to' or otherwise obstruct the Coast Guard. No longer will drug-runners be able to stall or resist Coast Guard commands with impunity. The additional sanctions for resisting `heave to' orders and for lying to law enforcement officers about a boat's destination, origin and other pertinent matters, will help the Coast Guard in its efforts to interdict illegal drugs and other contraband. 
The bill also provides specific authority to exclude from entry into our country international criminals and terrorists, including those engaged in flight to avoid foreign prosecution, alien smuggling, or arms or drug trafficking under specific circumstances. At the same time, we ensure that the Attorney General has full authority to make exceptions for humanitarian and similar reasons. 
The bill includes important money laundering provisions strongly supported by law enforcement. At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on anti-terrorism, FBI Director Louis Freeh noted the importance of money laundering laws as a tool in stopping not only international drug kingpins, but also international terrorists, such as Usama bin Laden, the multi-millionaire terrorist who has been linked to the recent embassy bombings. 
The bill has two important provisions aimed at computer crimes: it provides expanded wiretap authority, subject to court order, to cover computer crimes, and also gives us extraterritorial jurisdiction over access device fraud, such as stealing telephone credit card numbers, where the victim of the fraud is within our borders. 
We cannot stop international crime without international cooperation, however. This bill facilitates such cooperation by allowing our country to share the proceeds of joint forfeiture operations, to encourage participation by foreign countries. It streamlines procedures for executing MLAT requests that apply to multiple judicial districts. Furthermore, the bill addresses the essential but often overlooked role of state and local law enforcement in combating international crime, and authorizes reimbursement of state and local authorities for their cooperation in international crime cases. The bill helps our prosecutors in international crime cases by facilitating the admission of foreign records in U.S. courts. Finally, it will speed the wheels of justice by prohibiting international criminals from being credited with any time they serve abroad while they fight extradition to face charges in our country. 
These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. They are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. Working together, we were able to craft a bipartisan bill that will accomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure place. 
Finally, I would like to address the encryption amendment that Senator Kyl offered and then withdrew during Committee consideration of this bill. This amendment would have criminalized the use of encryption in the commission of any federal felony. 
Unlike analogous provisions incorporated into pending encryption bills, the Kyl amendment was not limited in any way to the criminal use of encryption `for the purpose of avoiding detection by law enforcement agencies or prosecution', as reflected in the SAFE bill, H.R. 695, or `with the intent to conceal that communication or information for the purpose of avoiding detection by a law enforcement agency or prosecutor,' as reflected in the Ashcroft-Leahy E-PRIVACY bill, S. 2067. The scope of the offered Kyl amendment raised concerns about inviting government over-reaching. There is no requirement in the amendment, for example, that a conviction for use of encryption be predicated on a conviction of any underlying criminal offense. 
Moreover, were this amendment to become law, it could chill even the routine use of encryption in the course of every day 
business, such as communications between clients and lawyers or accountants, since the mere use of encryption could result in exposure to substantial criminal penalties of up to five years in prison. 
In addition, as I noted during the committee's discussion of the amendment, the definition of encryption in the offered Kyl amendment varied greatly from definitions used in pending legislation, including bills I have introduced and cosponsored, that have been thoroughly vetted with encryption and other technical exports. The Kyl amendment definition of `encryption' is drafted so broadly that it could apply to any transformation of analog to digital communications, without any use of mathematical algorithms commonly associated with encryption. We can and should do better if we are going to add a definition of this highly technical operation to the criminal code for the first time. 
I appreciate the chairman's efforts, and Senator Kyl's willingness, to address this issue in a considered fashion in the next Congress. 
As a former prosecutor, I have long been concerned about helping law enforcement have the tools necessary to deal with changing technologies, and at the same time provide procedural safeguards to protect privacy and other important constitutional rights of American citizens. That is why I sponsored, among other laws, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in 1986 and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act in 1994, and worked with Senator Kyl and Chairman Hatch on passage of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act in 1996 and, most recently, on identity theft legislation. 
When it comes to encryption, I fully appreciate the challenge such technology poses for law enforcement officers, who may increasingly find that the communications they capture during court authorized electronic surveillance is unintelligible because it is scrambled with encryption technology. In the last Congress, I introduced legislation, S. 1587, that contained a provision to criminalize the use of encryption to obstruct justice. Again, in this Congress, I have introduced a bill with such a provision, S. 376, and cosponsored with Senator Ashcroft yet another bill, S. 2067, that contains a criminal penalty for the willful use of encryption to conceal incriminating communications or information. Thus, taking the step of creating a new crime to address the criminal use of encryption is not a new idea to me. 
I remain frustrated that sound encryption legislation was not enacted this year, particularly since this technology is such an effective crime prevention tool. The longer we go without addressing encryption policy in a comprehensive fashion, the longer our computer information, networks and critical infrastructures remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks and theft. 
I encourage the FBI to continue working with industry to try to define some cooperative efforts to facilitate court ordered access to encrypted files and communications. But the job of Congress is to ensure that procedural safeguards are in place to guide such cooperation in ways that comport with our Constitution. I look forward to working with Senator Kyl, as we have successfully in the past on technology issues, and with other members, on comprehensive encryption legislation that addresses both the criminal use of encryption as well as policy changes to promote the widespread use of encryption as a shield against cyber-crime.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is passing H.R. 4151, the `Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act.' This is virtually identical to the Kyl-Leahy substitute to S.512, which passed the Senate unanimously on July 30, 1998. This bill penalizes the theft of personal identification information that results in harm to the person whose identification is stolen and then used for false credit cards, fraudulent loans or for other illegal purposes. It also sets up a `clearinghouse' at the Federal Trade Commission to keep track of consumer complaints of identity theft and provide information to victims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath. 
Protecting the privacy of our personal information is a challenge, especially in this information age. Every time we obtain or use a credit card, place a toll-free phone call, surf the Internet, get a driver's license or are featured in `Who's Who,'in the form of personal information, which can be used without our consent or even our knowledge. Too frequently, criminals are getting hold of this information and using the personal information of innocent individuals to carry out other crimes. Indeed, U.S. News & World Report has called identity theft `a crime of the 90's'. 
The consequences for the victims of identity theft can be severe. They can have their credit ratings ruined and be unable to get credit cards, student loans, or mortgages. They can be hounded by creditors or collection agencies to repay debts they never incurred, but were obtained in their name, at their address, with their social security number or driver's license number. It can take months or even years, and agonizing effort, to clear their good names and correct their credit histories. I understand that, in some instances, victims of identity theft have even been arrested for crimes they never committed when the actual perpetrators provided law enforcement officials with assumed names. 
The new legislation provides important remedies for victims of identity theft. Specifically, it makes clear that these victims are entitled to restitution, including payment for any costs and attorney's fees in clearing up their credit histories and having to engage in any civil or administrative proceedings to satisfy debts, liens or other obligations resulting from a defendant's theft of their identity. In addition, the bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to keep track of consumer complaints of identity theft and provide information to victims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath. 
This is an important bill on an issue that has caused harm to many Americans. It has come a long way from its original Senate formulation, which would have made it an offense, subject to 15 years' imprisonment, to possess `with intent to deceive" identity information issued to another person. I was concerned that the scope of the proposed offense in the original Senate version of the bill would have resulted in the federalization of innumerable state and local offenses, such as the status offenses of underage teenagers using fake ID cards to gain entrance to bars or to buy cigarettes, or even the use of a borrowed ID card without any illegal purpose. This problem, and others, were addressed in the Kyl-Leahy substitute that was passed by the Senate. 
This bill appropriately limits the scope of the new offense governing the illegal transfer or use of another person's `means of identification' to exclude `possession.' This change ensures that the bill does not inadvertently subject innocuous conduct to the risk of serious federal criminal liability. For example, with this change, the bill would no longer raise the possibility of criminalizing the mere possession of another person's name in an address book or Rolodex, when coupled with some sort of bad intent. 
At the same time, the Kyl-Leahy substitute as reflected in H.R. 4151, restores the nuanced penalty structure of section 1028 of the Federal criminal code. Specifically, the bill provides that the use or transfer of 1 or more means of identification that results in the perpetrator receiving anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more over a 1-year period, would carry a penalty of a fine or up to 15 years' imprisonment, or both. The use or transfer of another person's means of identification that does not satisfy those monetary and time period requirements, would carry a penalty of a fine and up to three years' imprisonment, or both. 
Finally, again with the support of the Department of Justice, we created a limited and appropriate forfeiture penalty for these offenses and specified the forfeiture procedure to be used in connection with them. 
I am glad that Senator Kyl and I were able to join forces to craft legislation that both punishes the perpetrators of identity theft and helps the victims of this crime. 
Finally, an amendment added in the House, at the joint request of Senator Hatch and myself, gives the United States Judicial Conference limited authority to withhold personal and sensitive information about judicial officers and employees whose lives have been threatened. Apparently, sophisticated criminals are able to use information set forth in publicly available financial disclosure forms to collect more detailed personal information then used in carrying out threats against our judicial officers. This amendment is an important step to protect the lives of judges, and I am glad that we were able to accomplish this.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are currently 21 qualified nominees on the Senate calendar who have been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. Ten of those nominations would fill judicial emergency vacancies, which have been without a judge for over 18 months. We have been trying for days, weeks, months and in some cases years to get votes on these nominees. 
The Majority Leader has yet to call up the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. That nomination was first received by the Senate back in January 1996, almost three years ago. His nomination was delayed at every stage and this is now the judicial nomination that has been pending the longest on the Senate Executive Calendar this year, seven months. Over the last few days the Majority Leader has repeatedly indicated that he would be calling up this nomination, but he has not done so. 
I have heard rumors that some on the Republican side planned to filibuster this nomination. I cannot recall a judicial nomination being successfully filibustered. I do recall earlier this year when the Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I noted how improper it would be to filibuster a judicial nomination. During this year's long-delayed debate on the confirmation of Margaret Morrow, Senator Hatch said: `I think it is a travesty if we ever start getting into a game of filibustering judges.' Well, it appears that travesty was successfully threatened by some on the Republican side of the aisle and kept the Majority Leader from fulfilling his commitment to call up the nomination for a confirmation vote. 
Like the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division, it appears that some on the Republican side have decided to take the Paez nomination as a partisan trophy and to kill it--and to do so through obstruction and delay rather than allowing the Senate to vote up or down on the nomination. 
Judge Paez and all 21 judicial nominations recommended to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee deserve better. They should be cleared for confirmation without further delay. I note that of the 21 judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, 19 were reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee over the last five months. Those judicial nominations which cannot be cleared by unanimous consent ought to be scheduled for debate and a confirmation vote without further delay. 
Let me put this in perspective: Most Congresses end without any judicial nominations left on the Senate Executive Calendar. The Senate calendar is usually cleared of such nominations by a confirmations vote. Indeed the 99th, 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses all ended without a single judicial nomination left on the Senate calendar. The Democratic Senate majority in the two Congresses of the Bush Administration ended both those Congresses, the 101st and 102nd, without a single judicial nomination on the calendar. 
By contrast, the Republican Senate majority in the last Congress, the 104th, left an unprecedented seven judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar at adjournment without Senate action. And today, this Senate still has 21 judicial nominations on its calendar. The goal should be to vote on all judicial nominations on the calendar. To leave as many as seven judicial nominations without action at the end of this Congress is shameful; to be toying with the prospect of 21 is irresponsible. 
In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focused again on the problem of `too few judges and too much work.' He noted the vacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies and observed: `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.' He went on to note: `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.' 
That is good advice. That is what this Senate should do, take up these nominations and vote them up or vote them down. I believe that if the Senate were given an opportunity to have a fair vote on the merits of the nomination of Judge Richard Paez or Timothy Dyk or any of the 21 judicial nominations pending on the Senate Executive Calendar, they would be confirmed. Perhaps that is why we are not being allowed to vote. 
The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the number of judicial vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil our constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are harming the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. 
We began this year with the criticism of the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court ringing in our ears: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' Nonetheless, instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial vacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continued and unjustified and anonymous `holds' become regular order. 
To date, the Senate has actually been losing ground to normal attrition over the last two years. When Congress adjourned in 1996 there were 64 vacancies on the federal bench. In the last 24 months, another 87 vacancies have opened. And so, after the confirmation of 36 judges in 1997 and 48 so far this year, there has still been a net increase in judicial vacancies. The Senate has not even kept up with attrition. There are more vacancies in the federal judiciary today than when the Senate adjourned in 1996. 
This is without regard to the Senate's refusal to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a Republican presidential administration. Last year the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. 678, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 120 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past two years. In that light, the judicial vacancies crisis continues unabated. 
In order to understand why a judicial vacancies crisis is plaguing so many federal courts, we need only recall how unproductive the Republican Senate has been over the last three years. More and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for longer periods of time. The President has sent the Senate qualified nominees for 23 of those judicial emergency vacancies, nominations that are still pending as the Senate prepares to adjourn. 
When the American people consider how the Senate is meeting its responsibilities with respect to judicial vacancies, it must recall that as recently as 1994, the last year in which the Senate majority was Democratic, the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the Republican Senate three years to reach the century mark for judicial confirmations--to accomplish what we did in one session. 
Unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed to newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies crisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to consider nominees to longstanding vacancies. 
No one should take comfort from the number of confirmations achieved so far this year. It is only in comparison to the dismal achievements of the last two years that 48 judicial confirmations could be seen as an improvement. I recall that in 1992, during a presidential election year and President Bush's last year in office, a Democratic Senate confirmed 66 of his nominations. 
I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace. Instead, the Senate has confirmed only 48 judicial nominees instead of the 84 judges the Senate would have confirmed had it maintained the pace it achieved at the end of last year. The Senate has acted to confirm only 48 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies the federal judiciary experienced this year. 
I know that some are still playing a political game of payback for the defeat of the nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court and other Republican judicial nomination over the last decade. I remind the Senate that the Senate voted on the Bork nomination and voted on the nomination of Clarence Thomas and did so in each case in less than 15 weeks. To delay judicial nominations for months and years and to deny them a vote is wrong.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is an old saying that `where there is a will, there is a way.' That is very true of this Congress. 
Congress can work together when it wants to get a job done, when Members focus on resolving issues rather than sound bites for the nightly news. I was pleased for example, to have worked with Senators Bennett, Hatch, Dodd, and many other on complex computer issues in the Y2K readiness bill, which we were able to pass without objection in the Senate. 
It is unfortunate that sometimes when Congress quietly and effectively gets its job done, there is little press interest. So, for a moment I want to draw attention to the child nutrition bill, which Congress passed by working together. 
I want to pull everyone's attention away from the maelstrom to thank Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and their staffs for a job well done on the child nutrition bill. 
At conference with the House, I asked that this child nutrition bill be named in honor of Congressman Bill Goodling. The motion was immediately and unanimously accepted. For years he has worked to improve these programs. This will be his last reauthorization effort and we will miss his touch and his leadership the next time around. 
I want to also thank Lynn Selmser who has been Chairman Goodling's chief nutrition advisor for years. She has worked hard on these issues and deserves a great deal of credit. 
The Democratic conferees, Congressman Martinez of California and Congressman Bill Clay of Missouri, and their staffs, greatly contributed to this effort and kept the interests of children front and center. 
On the Senate side we worked together as a team. That is an even greater compliment than normal considering all the other issues facing the country. 
Of course, Chairman Lugar set the bipartisan course and carefully included all of us in the process. He has extended to me every courtesy and is a great chairman who is tough but fair to all Members. His chief counsel, Dave Johnson, has done, as he has always done in the past, an outstanding job from a legal and policy standpoint. 
I switched places with my good friend Senator Harkin a couple years ago. I took his job as ranking member on the nutrition subcommittee and he took mine as ranking member on the full Agriculture Committee. Senator Harkin is a fighter for children and these programs and Iowa should be proud of his accomplishments. 
Mark Halverson, his chief counsel on the committee, has been his nutrition advisor for years and handles these matter with great skill. 
Senator McConnell is chairman of the nutrition subcommittee and we have worked together for years to help improve and strengthen these programs. I was pleased that the Kentucky and Iowa child care pilot projects were made permanent by this bill. Dave Hovermale has done a superb job on these issues. 
The third Republican Conferee, Senator Cochran, is also the Chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. That is a lot of clout and it was well used to strengthen these child nutrition programs. I want to compliment Senator Cochran's agriculture staff person, Hunt Shipman, who has worked on these issues for years and has done a tremendous job. Senator Cochran, with my full support when I was chairman, helped to create the School Food Service Management Institute. I am pleased that this bill increases funding for that Institute and makes it permanent. 
I want to also thank Ed Barron of my staff who has advised me on nutrition issues and legislation for almost twelve years. I know that Senators on both sides of the aisle seek his advice on nutrition legislation. 
I also want to thank Michelle Barrett, who is on my staff, for helping out regarding these nutrition issues.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that we have been able to achieve passage of a bill that will help protect children from sexual predators. 
As the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is the responsibility of Chairman Hatch and myself to schedule legislation for consideration by the Committee and to draft changes, if warranted. Many bills never are scheduled for committee votes, and as the legislative session draws to a close, it becomes increasingly important that any bills brought to the Senate Floor adequately address concerns raised, to improve their chances for enactment. At this stage of the legislative process, even one senator can prevent passage of an ill-considered or controversial bill. Passage today of the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute to H.R. 3494 is due to the efforts of those members who have worked to resolve the legitimate concerns raised by the original bill we received from the House. 
In the case of H.R. 3494, the Chairman and I, joined by Senator DeWine. worked hard to bring forward a bill that was both strong and sensible and that would have a chance to win enactment in the short time remaining in the legislative session. 
Unlike some who may just want to score political points, we actually want to enact this bill to protect children, something that I worked hard to do as a prosecutor, when I convicted child molesters in the state of Vermont. We wanted to bring forward a bill that could pass. 
The problem area is the original House bill as it reached the Committee centered on its unintended consequences for law enforcement, regulation of the Internet, and important privacy rights that have nothing to do with child pornography. 
As I have said before, the whole world watches when the United States regulates the Internet, and we have a special obligation to do it right. 
The goal of H.R. 3494, and of the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute, is to provide stronger protections for children from those who would prey upon them. Concerns over protecting our children have only intensified in recent years with the growing popularity of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Cyberspace gives users access to a wealth of information; it connects people from around the world. But is also creates new opportunities for sexual predators and child pornographers to ply their trade. 
The challenge is to protect children from exploitation in cyberspace while ensuring that the vast democratic forum of the Internet remains an engine for the free exchange of ideas and information. 
The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine version of the bill meets this challenge. While neither version is a cure-all for the scourge of child pornography, the substitute is a useful step toward limiting the ability of cyber-pornographers and predators from harming children. 
The bill has come a long way since it was passed by the House last June. Significant objections were raised by civil liberties organizations and others to provisions in the original H.R. 3494, and we worked hard on a bipartisan basis to ensure that this bill would pass in the short time remaining in this Congress. 
I thank the Chairman and Senator DeWine, and other members of the Committee, for working together to address the legitimate concerns about certain provisions in the House-passed bill, and to make this substitute more focused and measured. Briefly, I would like to highlight and explain some of the changes we made, and why we made them. 
As passed by the House, H.R. 3494 would make it a crime, punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment, to do nothing more than `contact' a minor, or even just attempt to `contact' a minor, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. This provision, which would be extremely difficult to enforce and would invite court challenges, does not appear in the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute. In criminal law terms, the act of making contact is not very far along the spectrum of an overt criminal act. Targeting `attempts' to make contact would be even more like prosecuting a thought crime. It is difficult to see how such a provision would be enforced without inviting significant litigation. 
Another new crime created by the House bill prohibited the transmittal of identifying information about any person under 18 for the purpose of encouraging unlawful sexual activity. In its original incarnation, this provision would have had the absurd result of prohibiting a person under the age of consent from e-mailing her own address or telephone number to her boyfriend. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute fixes this problem by making it clear that a violation must involve the transmission of someone else's identifying information. In addition, to eliminate any notice problem arising from the variations in state statutory rape laws, the Senate bill conforms the bill to the federal age of consent--16--in provisions regarding the age of the identified minor. The Senate bill also clarifies that the defendant must know that the person about whom he was transmitting identifying information was, in fact, under 16. This change was particularly important because, in the anonymous world of cyberspace, a person may have no way of knowing the age of the faceless person with whom he is communicating. 
Another provision of the House bill, which makes it a crime to transfer obscene material to a minor, raised similar concerns. Again, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill lowers the age of minority from 18 to 16--the federal age of majority--and provides that the defendant must know he is dealing with someone so young. This provision of the Senate bill, like the House bill, applies only to `obscene' material--that is, material that enjoys no First Amendment 
protection whatever--material that is patently offensive to the average adult. The bill does not purport to proscribe the transferral of constitutionally protected material. 
The original House bill would also have criminalized certain conduct directed at a person who had been `represented ' to be a minor, even if that person was, in fact, an adult. The evident purpose was to make clear that the targets of sting operations are not relieved of criminal liability merely because their intended victim turned out to be an undercover agent and not a child. The new `sting' provisions addressed a problem that simply does not currently exist: No court has ever endorsed an impossibility defense along the lines anticipated by the House bill. The creation of special `sting' provisions in this one area could unintentionally harm law enforcement interests by lending credence to impossibility defenses raised in other sting and undercover situations. At the same time, these provisions would have criminalized conduct that was otherwise lawful: It is not a crime for adults to communicate with each other about sex, even if one of the adults pretends to be a child. Given these significant concerns, the `sting' provisions have been stricken from the House Leahy-DeWine substitute. 
Another concern with the House bill was its modification of the child pornography possession laws. Current law requires possession of three or more pornographic images in order for there to be criminal liability. Congress wrote this requirement into the law as a way of protecting against government overreaching. By eliminating this numeric requirement, the House bill put at risk the unsuspecting Internet user who, by inadvertence or mistake, downleaded a single pornographic image of a child. While we support the concept of zero tolerance for child pornography, the inevitable result of the House language in overriding the earlier congressional definition would be to chill the free exchange of information over the Web by making users fearful that, if they download illegal material by mistake, they could go to jail. 
More importantly, this provision could also inadvertently harm law enforcement interests by chilling those who inadvertently or mistakenly come upon child pornography from bringing the material to the attention of law enforcement officers. Technically, under the House-passed bill, these law-abiding citizens would be subject to criminal liabiilty. 
Efforts to avoid these unintended consequences, while promoting zero tolerance of child pornography, could not be resolved in the time constraints facing the Committee. However, our bipartisan efforts to draft workable language have borne fruit. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Sessions amendment accommodates the objective of `zero balance' for child pornography, but permits a narrow affirmative defense for certain defendants who, in good faith, destroyed the prohibited material or reported it to law enforcement authorities. With this amendment, we have achieved zero tolerance without unintended consequences for innocent Internet users and for law enforcement. 
The House bill would have given the Attorney General sweeping administrative authority to subpoena records and witnesses investigations involving crimes against children. This proposed authority to issue administrative subpoenas would have given federal agents the power to compel disclosures without any oversight by a judge, prosecutor, or grand jury, and without any of the grand jury secrecy requirements. We appreciate that such secretary requirements may pose obstacles to full and efficient cooperation of federal/state task forces in their joint 
efforts to reduce the steadily increasing use of the Internet to perpetrate crimes against children, including crimes involving the distribution of child pornography. In addition, we understand that some U.S. Attorneys' Offices are reluctant to open grand jury investigations when the only goal is to identify individuals who have not yet, and may never, commit a federal (as opposed to state or local) offense. 
The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute accommodates these competing interests by granting the Department a narrowly drawn authority to subpoena the information that it most needs: Routine subscriber account information from Internet Service Providers (ISPS), which may provide appropriate notice to subscribers. 
The new reporting requirement established by H.R. 3494 would also create new problems. Under current law, ISPs are generally free to report suspicious communications to law enforcement authorities. Under H.R. 3494, ISPs would be required to report such communications when they involve child pornography; failure to do so would be punishable by a substantial fine. 
In addressing this issue, the Chairman, Senator DeWine and I are committed to eradicating the market of child pornography, believing that child pornography is inherently harmful to children. ISPs that come across such material should report it, and, in most cases, they already do. We must tread cautiously, however, before we compel private citizens to act as good Samaritans or to assume duties and responsibilities that are better left to law enforcement following statutory defined procedures to safeguard privacy and ensure due process. 
The ISPs have cooperated in refining this provision of the House bill to make it more workable. Particular consideration was given to the appropriate standard for triggering a duty to report. We wanted to make the bar sufficiently high to discourage ISPs from erring on the side of over-reporting every questionable image. Over-reporting would overwhelm law enforcement agencies with worthless investigative leads and make it more difficult for them to isolate the leads worth pursuing. Over-reporting would also jeopardize the First Amendment rights of Internet users, while needlessly magnifying the administrative burden of the ISPs.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a time when Senators say goodbye to Senators who are leaving, and I was privileged, in 1974, to be elected with a very special class of Senators, a very large class of Senators--nearly a dozen--who came to this body. We developed personal friendships. Of that class, there are only four left: The distinguished senior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn; the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Ford; the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers; and myself. Each of the other three have announced their plans to retire this year. In some ways I feel like the lonely person who is given the chore to turn out the lights after everybody else leaves, because I will be the last of the class of 1974. 
I am going to speak of each of them, but I wish to speak now and to give tribute to a great statesman, a person who is recognized as a true American hero and a very good friend of mine, John Hershel Glenn, Jr. 
As I said, we both arrived in the Senate at the same time in 1974. There was a big difference, however. I came here as a 34-year-old unknown county prosecutor from rural Vermont. John Glenn arrived here as a living American legend. We have served together now for 24 years and it is with the fondest memories that I recollect his time here. I remember the very first day I met him. The two of us had gone over to see the legendary Jim Eastland, President pro tempore of the Senate. That is probably the only time, then or since, I have ever seen John Glenn look at all nervous, was going in to see Senator Eastland. Senator Glenn was nervous. I was terrified. There is a big difference. 
But John Glenn will be remembered here in the Senate as a man who advocated a role for Government in daily life, but he never stopped trying to make Government more efficient. He is one of our leading experts on science and technology. He has always been a tireless advocate for Government-sponsored scientific and health research. He brought tremendous intellect and dedication to the task of preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I remember when the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a wasteful nuclear arms race, John Glenn was a voice of reason and moderation. 
He has used his seat on the Armed Services Committee to advocate for our men and women in uniform, while at the same time looking out for wasteful spending. I remember, when I and others began to have doubts about the costly B-2 bomber--$2 billion a plane--that I read papers and memos about it. John Glenn went out and flew it, then came back and said its cost outweighed its benefits. I credit him for saving the taxpayers a lot of money. 
He used his position in the Governmental Affairs Committee to expose waste in Government and to clean up the Nation's nuclear materials production plants. 
In his conduct here in the Senate, John has always been nonpartisan, polite, accommodating, but always true to his beliefs. His personality reminds me of Longfellow's words, `A tender heart; a will inflexible.' 
It is hard for us to think of John Glenn before he was a national hero, but not so long ago he was a smalltown boy like many of us. He was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, OH. He grew up in the tiny town of New Concord, OH. But, like millions of Americans, his life was forever changed by World War II. 
Many of us know the details of what makes John Glenn a hero, but I want to repeat them for my colleagues. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, he was commissioned in the Marines Corps. He served as a fighter pilot in the South Pacific. He stayed in the Marines, and when the Korean War started, John Glenn requested combat duty. He ended up flying 149 combat missions in both wars. How good a pilot is our colleague from Ohio? In the last 9 days of fighting in Korea, he downed three Chinese MiG fighters in combat along the Yalu River. 
In July 1957, he set a speed record from Los Angeles to New York, the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed. 
An avid pilot to this day, John has over 9,000 hours of flight time in a variety of aircraft. To put that statistic in perspective, to equal that mark you would have to fly 8 hours a day, every day of the year, for 3 years. 
Probably the flight that I remember the best, the one I enjoyed as much as any, was when John Glenn and I flew to the northeast kingdom of Vermont in a small float plane at the height of glorious fall foliage. John and Annie Glenn were staying with Marcelle and I at our farm in Middlesex, VT. John had borrowed the plane from a friend of mine in Vermont. We flew up and set down in one of those little Vermont ponds with the fall foliage around it. There happened to be a trapper's convention there. Some of the people there were calling him Colonel Glenn, not Senator Glenn. They kind of put up with me being there, but he was the hero. 
Of course I do remember also the look on John and Marcelle's and Annie's faces when we landed in Montpelier Airport in a heavy crosswind. John turned to me after he taxied up and said, `You know, I have never been so frightened landing anything in my life,' which almost stopped my heart to hear him tell it. But when we got out of the plane, John was wearing--this is accurate now--a skunk-skin cap which the trappers had given him. 
He stepped out of the airplane with me shaking and quivering behind him. Annie turned to Marcelle and says, `Marcelle, I told you we never should have let those boys go off by themselves.' 
We all know what happened in a far more dramatic time when John strapped himself into a tiny capsule on top a gigantic tube of volatile fuel on February 20, 1962. When he landed 4 hours 55 minutes later, John Glenn not only became the first American to orbit the Earth, but he boosted the psyche of our Nation in a way not seen equaled before or since. 
Cicero said a man of courage is also full of faith. It should be said that John Glenn is a man who puts all his faith in God. 
All his accomplishments here in the Senate, in the cockpit, in the capsule, all pale before the one true constant in John Glenn's life, and that is the love he shares with his beautiful wife Annie. They are truly a couple for the ages and role models for all of us. Married for 55 years, they have two wonderful children, John David and Carolyn Ann, whom we all know as Lyn. 
When the space shuttle Discovery surges into space later this month, the cabin will be cramped with the seven astronauts aboard. But sitting with John in spirit, as she has for so many years, will be Annie. They are truly inseparable. No matter how fast or far he travels, she is always with him. 
Mr. President, later this month the eyes of the Nation and the world will focus on Cape Canaveral, FL. We will watch as a marvelous machine, built by Americans, flown by an international crew, roars into the heavens in the name of science, and on board will be our colleague from Ohio, a great Senator, an expert pilot and extraordinary American hero, my friend, John Glenn. I intend to be there to cheer him on. 
Once again, as he has done in so many ways over the years, John Glenn will make us turn our eyes toward the heavens, and like all who will be there, I will say, `Godspeed, John Glenn, and thank you.'

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Y2K bill demonstrates successful bipartisanship and cooperation, and how well Congress can work together when it wants to. Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, Senators Hatch, Bennett, Dodd, Thompson, Kyl and I, along with others, have worked with the Administration and the House of Representatives to create and pass this legislation. I thank them for their hard work and dedication to this issue. 
Four-hundred and forty-nine days from now, millions of computers controlling our air traffic, recording stock and credit card transactions, running electric and telephone systems, tracking bank deposits and monitoring hospital patients may crash in befuddlement. All of this is due to the short-sighted omission of a couple of digits, a one and a nine, from computer chips. Passage of this bill is a signal to the world that by acting now, we can work together to avoid these problems. 
The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act will not eliminate the millennium bug--regrettably, no legislation could do that. However, it will greatly increase the chances that industry, university and government experts will work cooperatively to come up with the solutions. 
One of the scariest aspects of the Y2K bug has been the silence of businesses and industries in the face of this common enemy. Liability concerns have muted industry experts, dashing the best hopes for developing fixes for this problem. The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act was designed to overcome this isolation and create a free flow of constructive information. 
The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act will encourage the sharing of knowledge and working together to create solutions. This bill does not give companies liability protection for their products or services. Rather, for a limited time it will provide adjusted procedures for the exchange of Year 2000 information. This is our best bet to ensuring that services and products will continue operating after midnight on December 31, 1999. 
This bill also includes a provision I proposed that will assist consumers, small businesses and local governments. It charters a national information clearinghouse and website as a starting point to provide rapid and accurate information about solving Y2K problems. This will be a needed tool for small businesses, local governments and citizens so they can prepare for the millennium. 
I want to thank the President and Vice President for their foresight in this issue, and the corporate leaders who worked together with us to get this done. Major industries--from telecommunications, electric, computer, transportation, energy, health, insurance and many others--pitched in and listened to each other and worked together. I congratulate and thank Senators for their unanimous support for this measure. It is reassuring to know that even in the midst of other dramas, Congress can come together to tackle fundamental issues confronting our national economy and security. I look forward to the President signing this important legislation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that last night the Senate took up and passed H.R. 3332. 
I first introduced my domain name study bill, S. 1727, on March 6, 1998. It was cosponsored by Senator Ashcroft on May 21, 1998 and passed the Senate on June 26, 1998 as an amendment to S. 1609, Senate legislation to authorize the Next Generation Internet program. The House passed a very similar domain name study bill on September 14, 1998 as part of H.R. 3332, its legislation to authorize the Next Generation Internet program. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out a substitute amendment to S. 1727 on September 17, 1998 that was identical to the domain name study language that is in H.R. 3332. Now, with the Senate passage of H.R. 3332, the domain name study language will be presented to the President for his signature into law. 
The Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study legislation that is incorporated into H.R. 3332 authorizes the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects on trademark rights of adding new generic top level domain names (gTLDs), and related dispute resolution procedures. 
When I first introduced this bill in March, it was, in part, a response to the Administration's Green Paper released on January 30, 1988, on the domain name system (DNS), which suggested the addition of five new generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs). 
Although adding new gTLDs, as the Green Paper proposed, would allow more competition and more individuals and businesses to obtain addresses that more closely reflect their names and functions, I was concerned as were many businesses, that the increase in gTLDs would make the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or dilution more difficult. In addition, increasing the number of gTLDs without an efficient dispute resolution mechanism had the potential of fueling litigation and the threat of litigation, with an overall chilling effect on the choice and use of domain names. 
The Green Paper properly raised the important questions of how to protect consumers' interests in locating the brand or vendor of their choice on the Internet without being deceived or confused, how to protect companies from having their brand equity diluted in an electronic environment, and how to resolve disputes efficiently and inexpensively. It did not, however, answer these complex and important questions. Dictating the introduction of new gTLDs without analyzing the impact that these new gTLDs would have on trademark rights and related dispute resolution procedures seemed like putting the cart before the horse. 
The Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study bill is intended to put the horse back before the cart. We should understand the effects on trademark rights of adding new gTLDs and 
related dispute resolution procedures before we move to add significant numbers of new gTLDs. Since its introduction in March, groups such as ATT, Bell Atlantic, Time Warner, the International Trademark Association, the Information Technology Industry Council, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Domain Name Rights Coalition, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, amongst others, have endorsed this legislation reflected in the Leahy-Ashcroft domain name study bill. 
The Administration's White Paper, released on June 5, 1988, backed off the Green Paper's earlier suggestion to add five new gTLDs. Instead, the White Paper proposes that the new corporation would be the most appropriate body to make decisions as to how many, if any, new gTLDs should be added once it has global input, including from the study called for in the Leahy-Ashcroft domain name bill. Specifically, the White Paper calls upon the World Intellectual Property Organization, inter alia, to `evaluate the effects, based on studies conducted by independent organizations, such as the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, of adding new gTLDs, and related dispute resolution procedures on trademark and intellectual property holders.' 
I commend the Administration for the deliberate approach it has taken to facilitate the withdrawal of the U.S. government from the governance of the Internet and to privatize the management of Internet names and addresses. We should have a Hippocratic Oath for the Internet--that before we adopt any new regimen that affects the Internet, we should make sure we are doing no harm to this dynamic medium. 
In order for the WIPO study to be able to evaluate the effects, based on studies conducted by independent organizations, such as the NRC, of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures on trademark rights, the Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study legislation in H.R. 3332 instructs the NRC to release an interim report that can be considered before the release of the March 1, 1999 WIPO study. I believe it beneficial, however, for the final report of the NRC to still be released after the WIPO study, so that the NRC can take into account the results and recommendations offered by the WIPO study and offer its comments on the WIPO study. 
One might ask whether the NRC report is necessary, given the fact that WIPO will also be doing a study. I believe that the answer is a resounding `yes'. Since the Internet is an outgrowth of U.S. government investments carried out under agreements with U.S. agencies, major components of the DNS are still performed by or subject to agreements with U.S. agencies. Examples include assignments of numerical addresses to Internet users, management of the system of registering names for Internet users, operation of the root server system, and protocol assignment. although U.S. government management of the Internet's most basic functions will soon be phased out, it is still not clear who will be running the new nonprofit corporation which, according to the Administration's White Paper, will oversee the domain name system. Moreover, the U.S. leads the world in the creation and dissemination of intellectual property. Given the U.S. interests that are at stake and the uncertainty in who will run the domain name system and how it will affect U.S. stakeholders, I think it important that a U.S. entity examine the issue of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures on trademark rights. As important as it is for WIPO to benefit from an objective U.S. entity's perspective on this matter, I also think that an objective U.S. entity should be tasked with considering whatever recommendations are issued by WIPO. 
I am therefore pleased that the Senate passed H.R. 3332 last night with the Leahy/Ashcroft domain name study bill.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today submitting a Concurrent Resolution expressing the sense of Congress regarding measures to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. 
This resolution is cosponsored by Senator Dodd, who is the ranking member of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee and among the most knowledgeable Members of Congress on Mexican affairs, Senator Feinstein, Senator Bingaman, Senator Jeffords, Senator Feingold, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bumpers, Senator Boxer, Senator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, Senator Murray, Senator Wyden, Senator Harkin, and Senator Mikulski. 
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi is today introducing an identical resolution in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, the purpose of this resolution is to convey our support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Chiapas that has been simmering since the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Since then, and despite attempts at negotiations, the situation remains explosive. Scores of innocent people, mostly impoverished Indians, have been killed. Thousands have fled their homes and are living in squalid conditions, made unbearable by the recent flooding. 
This resolution does not attempt to take sides or to dictate an outcome. The situation in Chiapas is a complex one that has social, ethnic, economic and political dimensions. It is a manifestation of years of Mexican history. It is for the Mexican people to resolve. 
But despite its complexities, there is no doubt that the indigenous people of Chiapas have been the victims of centuries of injustice. Most do not own any land and they live--as their parents and grandparents did--in abject poverty. The Zapatista uprising was a reflection of that injustice and despair, and the political 
tension and violence of recent years has only exacerbated their plight. 
To his credit, President Zedillo has called for a resumption of negotiations and has visited Chiapas several times. Recently, his government invited Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, to visit Mexico to discuss the Chiapas situation. I welcome that. But there remains a deep distrust between the two sides, and no sign that the government's strategy is working. This resolution calls on our Secretary of State to encourage the Mexican Government and the Zapatistas to support negotiations that address the underlying causes of the conflict, to achieve lasting peace. 
Mr. President, this resolution is not meant to embarrass or interfere. It is to convey our concern about the people of Chiapas, and the urgent need for concrete progress to resolve a conflict that has cost many innocent lives and which threatens the economic and political development of our southern neighbor. 
Many Senators may not know the history of the Chiapas conflict. After the 1994 uprising, the Zapatistas and the government tried to resolve the conflict peacefully. Those negotiations collapsed in 1996 when the Mexican Government walked away from a partial agreement which would have given the inhabitants of Chiapas greater rights. 
Since then the situation has gotten worse. Last December, Mexican paramilitary forces killed 45 unarmed civilians in the village of Acteal. In June, two police officers and eight villagers died when Mexican soldiers and police clashed with Zapatista supporters. There are now tens of thousands of Mexican soldiers who patrol the roads in and out of Chiapas in armored vehicles. They patrol the skies in low flying helicopters. They surround the impoverished communities of Zapatista supporters, who, not surprisingly, see the government as their enemy. On top of that, there are armed paramilitary groups who have been responsible for some of the worst atrocities. 
The dissolution of the National Mediation Commission after the resignation of its President, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, has further impeded efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully. 
I regularly receive reports of violence or harassment directed against human rights monitors, including American citizens, who have been summarily expelled from Mexico for activities that amount to nothing more than criticizing the policies of the Mexican Government. 
One case I have followed closely involves an American priest who lived in Chiapas for some 19 years. He was arrested, driven to the airport, accused of engaging in illegal political activity on the basis of anonymous, unsubstantiated allegations, and summarily expelled. Efforts by myself, the American Ambassador, and the Department of State to correct this injustice have been entirely unsuccessful. The Mexican Government has consistently misrepresented the facts in his case. 
Despite President Zedillo's repeated calls for renewed dialogue with the Zapatistas and their supporters, and despite the fact that the Zapatistas do not pose a credible threat to the Mexican Government, the Mexican Government's actions have not improved the situation. The government seems to believe that it can solve the problem by simultaneously threatening and holding out promises to Zapatista supporters, even though they live in the same miserable conditions as their parents, their parents' parents, and their grandparents' grandparents, and they deeply distrust the government. 
Mr. President, the United States and Mexico share many interests. We have worked together to address concerns on both sides of the border. I have no doubt that the government and the Zapatistas can solve this problem, if they want to. But we must also recognize that violence and instability in Mexico directly affect United States economic and security interests, and human rights abuses, wherever and however they occur, deserve our attention. 
This Resolution reflects a balanced approach. Neither side in the conflict is blameless. To resolve it peacefully, both must want peace and be willing to take steps to create the conditions that make it possible for good faith negotiations to succeed, and then sit down at the table together. 
The Resolution urges the Secretary of State to ensure that the United States is not contributing to the political violence, by reaffirming current law which limits assistance and exports of equipment only to Mexican security forces who are primarily involved in counter-narcotics activities and who do not commit human rights abuses. 
It calls on the Mexican Government to respect the rights of American citizens and human rights monitors in Mexico. 
Mr. President, some may ask why we are submitting this Resolution today, when this conflict has been simmering for years. One reason is that after all this time the problem is no closer to being solved. It has gotten worse, not better. The recent flooding has caused an urgent, humanitarian crisis among displaced people in Chiapas who are struggling to survive. And last week's elections showed, not surprisingly, that fully half the people in Chiapas have no faith in the political process. 
In short, the status quo is unacceptable. The violence is unacceptable. The lack of any meaningful peace process is unacceptable. There is no reason why so many civilians have died. There is no reason why the causes of the conflict cannot be openly discussed and effectively addressed. 
This Resolution sends a message to the Mexican Government, the Zapatistas, our own administration and the international community that an intensified effort is needed urgently to resolve the conflict peacefully. 
Mr. President, I want to thank the other Senators who have cosponsored this resolution

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to add my own support to promoting electronic commerce and keeping it free from new Federal, State or local taxes. I am a cosponsor of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, S. 442. 
In ways that are becoming increasingly apparent, the Internet is changing the way we do business. More than 50 million people around the world surf the net--50 million. And more and more of these users turn to the World Wide Web and the Internet to place orders with suppliers or to sell products or services to customers or to communicate with clients. 
The Internet market is growing at a tremendous pace. Over the past 2 years, sales generated through the web grew more than 5,000 percent. In fact, in a recent Business Week article, electronic commerce sales are estimated to reach $379 billion by the year 2002, pumping up the Nation's gross domestic sales by $10 to $20 billion every year by 2002. 
And I see it in my own State of Vermont. On my home page on the web, I have put together a section called `Cyber Selling In Vermont.' It is a step-by-step resource guide for exploring how you can have on-line commerce and other business uses of the Internet. It has links to businesses in Vermont that are already cyberselling. 
As of today, this site includes links to web sites of more than 100 Vermont businesses doing business on the Internet. They range from the Quill Bookstore in Manchester Center to Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse in Newport. 
For the past 3 years, I have held annual workshops on doing business on the Internet in my home State. I have received a tremendous response to these workshops from Vermont businesses of all sizes and customer bases, from Main Street merchants to boutique entrepreneurs. 
At my last Doing Business on the Internet Workshop in Vermont, we had these small business owners from all over our State. They told how successful they have been selling on the web. They had such Main Street businesses as a bed and breakfast, or in one case a wool boutique, and a real estate company. One example is Megan Smith of the Vermont Inn in Killington. She attended one of my workshops. Now she is taking reservations over the net, reservations not just from Vermont, but from throughout the country. So cyberselling pays off for Vermonters. 
Now Vermont businesses have an opportunity to take advantage of this tremendous growth by selling their goods on line. I have tried to be a missionary for this around our State, because I believe the Internet commerce can help Vermonters ease some of the geographic barriers that historically have limited our access to markets where our products can thrive. 
The World Wide Web and Internet businesses can sell their goods all over the world in the blink of an eye, and they can do it any time of the day or night. 
As this electronic commerce continues to grow--for even a small State like mine; we can see it all over the country--I hope we in Congress can be leaders in developing tax policy that will nurture this new market. I followed closely the Internet Tax Freedom Act since Senator Wyden introduced it last summer. I want to commend the senior Senator from Oregon for his leadership on cyber tax policy. 
More than 30,000 cities and towns in the United States are able to levy discriminatory sales on electronic commerce. Because of that, we need this national bill to provide the stability necessary if this electronic commerce is going to flourish. 
We are not asking for a tax-free zone on the Internet. If sales taxes and other taxes would apply to traditional sales and services under State or local law, then those taxes would also apply to Internet sales under our bill. But the bill would outlaw taxes that are applied only to Internet sales in a discriminatory manner. 
We do not want somebody to kill these businesses before they even begin because they think it is some way they can pluck the money out of the pockets of those who are using the Internet. We should not allow the future of electronic commerce--electronic commerce that can greatly expand the markets of even our Main Street businesses--we should not allow it to be crushed by the weight of multiple taxation. Without this legislation, they would have faced multiple taxation, and a lot of these Internet businesses now creating jobs, now flourishing, now adding to the commerce of our States would have been wiped out of business. 
This legislation creates a temporary national commission to study and recommend appropriate rules for international, Federal, State, and local government taxation of transactions over the Internet. This also will help us very, very much. 
The commission would submit its findings and recommendations to Congress within the next 18 months. With the help of this commission, Congress should be able to put a tax framework in place to foster electronic commerce and protect the rights of state and local governments when the three-year moratorium ends. 
During my time in the Senate, I always tried to protect the rights of Vermont state and local legislators to craft their laws free from interference from Washington. Thus, the imposition of a broad, open-ended moratorium on state and local taxes relating to the Internet in the original bill gave me pause. I certainly agreed with the goal of no new state and local taxation of online commerce, but the means were questionable. 
I believe those questions have been fully answered by the changes made to this legislation during its consideration in the Commerce and Finance Committees. 
I want to commend Senators Burns, Kerry, McCain, Moynihan and Roth for working with Senator Wyden, the sponsor of the original bill, to craft a substitute bill that protects the free flow of online commerce while accommodating the rights of state and local governments. 
Today there are more than 400,000 businesses selling their sales and services on the World Wide Web around the world. This explosion in web growth has led to thousands of new and exciting opportunities for businesses, from Main Street to Wall Street. The Internet Tax Freedom Act will ensure that these businesses, and many others, continue to reap the rewards of electronic commerce. 
Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax Freedom Act to foster the growth of online commerce and urge my colleagues to support its swift passage into law.

Mr. LEAHY. I yield myself such time as I may need. 
We heard discussion about the Ninth Circuit. There was a suggestion that it is reversed all the time. 
In the year ending March 31, 1997, they decided 8,701 matters; the year ending March 31, 1996, 7,813 matters; in 1995, 7,955 matters. Well, 99.7 percent of those matters were not overturned.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been suggested that if a court is overturned by the Supreme Court, that people ought to start asking whether those judges should be thrown out. And one Senator said, `Suppose we were overturned like that, how long would we last here in the Senate?' Well, it seems to me that the U.S. Senate voted very strongly--84 Senators voted for the so-called Communications Decency Act even though it was obviously unconstitutional. That went to the Supreme Court and was overturned. 
A majority of the U.S. Senators voted for the line-item veto--again, blatantly unconstitutional but popular back home. That was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Eighty-five percent of the people, according to a poll, said they wanted some form of the Brady bill. This Senate voted for that overwhelmingly, knowing that it was probably unconstitutional. That was overturned by the Supreme Court. 
I can think, since I have been here, of a number of times when this body went pell-mell forward on a number of bills because it was so popular to vote for them. Many times I found myself as a lone dissenter on matters that went to the U.S. Supreme Court and were then overturned as unconstitutional. 
The same Senators who criticize judges who from time to time have an opinion reversed by a higher court ought to be careful with respect to what they advocate. If that standard were applied to Senators should all Senators who voted for a bill that gets overturned as unconstitutional have to resign? Maybe not the first time they vote for something declared unconstitutional; maybe they shouldn't have to leave the first time, because everybody is allowed a mistake. If they did it a second time, do they have to go then? I come from a tolerant State. I belong to a religion that believes in redemption and forgiveness. So we will let them get away with two. 
We are in the baseball season. Suppose they voted for three unconstitutional bills because they were popular but they get overturned as unconstitutional. Well, we are now considering perspectives beyond religion and politics, we are going to baseball. Three times, three strikes--are you out? Let's be a little careful when we use some of these analogies about who should or should not serve on a court depending on how many times they get reversed. 
Senators may not want to go back and ask how many times they voted for something, how many times they gave wonderful speeches in favor of something, how many times they sent out press releases, sent feeds back to their TV station, maybe used them in their reelection ads, and then, guess what? The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that legislation as unconstitutional. 
Especially, I say to some of my friends on the other side, when the majority of those voting to declare those laws unconstitutional were Republican members of the U.S. Supreme Court, reported by Republican Presidents, and extolled as great conservatives. In each one of the cases I have referenced, I agreed with them. They were the true conservatives. What they wanted to conserve was the Constitution of the United States. 
Sometimes when we want to stand up here and tell how conservative we are, we ought to say: Are we conservative with regard to the Constitution of the United States? Are we prepared to conserve the U.S. Constitution? 
I recall one day on a court-stripping bill on this floor years ago an effort was made to pass a court-stripping bill, a bill to withdraw jurisdiction from the courts over certain matters of constitutional remedies, because the polls showed how popular it would be. One Friday afternoon, three Senators stood on this floor and talked that bill into the ground. 
I was proud to be one of those three Senators. As I walked out with the other two--one, the Senator from Connecticut, then an independent, Senator Lowell Weicker; the third Senator who had joined with us to talk down that court-stripping bill, my good friend, now deceased, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Senator Goldwater put his arms around the shoulders of both of us, and we were both a little bit taller than he, and said, `I think we are the only three conservatives in the place.' 
I can't speak for Senator Weicker, how he might have felt about that; I took it as a heck of a compliment--not because I go back and claim to be a conservative in my politics back home. I only claim to be a Vermonter, doing the best I can for my State. When I stand up for the U.S. Constitution, as I have so many times for the first amendment, I do it because I try to conserve what is best in our country. 
Professor William Fletcher is a fine nominee. He is a decent man. He was first nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, May 7, 1995, over 3 years ago. I don't know of any judicial nominee who has had to endure the delay and show the patience of this nominee. He was nominated May 7, 1995. We are only a few months away from 1999. 
I have spoken on many occasions about how the Republican Senate is rewriting the record books in terms of delaying action on judicial nominees, but Professor Fletcher's 41 months exceeds the 33-month delay in the consideration of the nomination of Judge Richard Paez and Anabelle Rodriguez; or the 26 months it took to confirm Ann Aiken; or the 24 months it took to confirm Margaret McKeown; or the 21-month delay before confirmation of Margaret Morrow and Hilda Tagle who found, unfortunately, in this Senate, that if you are either a woman or a minority, you seem to take a lot longer to get through the Senate confirmation process. 
In the annual report on the judiciary, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court observed:  
Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994. 
He went on to note: 
The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down. 
Mr. President, 3 1/2 years is a long time to examine a nomination and to leave a judgeship vacant. Even at the pace of the U.S. Senate, 3 1/2 years is long enough for us to make up our mind. 
Around Mother's Day in 1996, the Judiciary Committee did report the nomination of Professor Fletcher to the Senate, but that year the majority, Republican majority, decided not to vote on any nominees to courts of appeals, so the nomination was not considered by the Senate. The committee vote, though, in 1996 was more than 2-1 in favor, including Senator Hatch, Senator Specter, Senator DeWine, and Senator Simpson. This year, the vote was delayed until past Mother's Day. The vote was taken May 21, 1998. The committee's second consideration of the nominee resulted in a vote of 2-1. 
I know some do not like Judge Betty Binn Fletcher. They do not agree with her decisions. In our Federal judicial system, there are mechanisms for holding judges accountable. There are panels of judges at the courts of appeals. There are en banc considerations. There is ultimately the controlling authority of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Fletcher's decisions are subject to review and reversal, just like every other judge. 
No one should turn their anger with Judge Betty Fletcher into a reason to delay or oppose the appointment of Professor William A. Fletcher. No one should try to get back at Judge Betty B. Fletcher through delay of the confirmation of her son. 
Senate Republicans have continued their attacks against an independent Federal judiciary and delayed in filling longstanding vacancies with qualified persons being nominated by the President. Professor Fletcher's nomination has been a casualty of their efforts. Forty-one months--41 months--and two confirmation hearings have been enough time for examination to bring the Fletcher nomination to a vote. Professor Fletcher is a fine person and an outstanding nominee who has had to endure years of delay and demagoguery as some chose to play politics with our independent judiciary. 
Professor Fletcher has the support of both Senators from California. The ABA gave him the highest rating. He is supported by many judges and lawyers and scholars from around the State, the Ninth Circuit, and the country. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, and many other Republican Senators who have continued to support this fair-minded nominee. 
I look forward to Senate action this afternoon and I look forward to the fact that he will be confirmed. 
Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as is the Chairman, I am a member of the VA/HUD Subcommittee that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs. He knows my personal concern about the situation facing our veterans in New England. The Appropriations Committee added $278 million in this conference report for veterans medical care, a significant increase over the President's budget request. It was my understanding that a portion of this increase will go to New England. Am I correct in that assumption?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America's founders recognized and valued the creativity of this nation's citizens to such an extent that intellectual property rights are rooted in the Constitution. Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution states that 
The Congress shall have power . . . [t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. 
The Continental Congress proclaimed, 
Nothing is more properly a man's own than the fruit of his study.' 
Protecting intellectual property rights is just as important today as it was when America was a fledgling nation. 
It is for this reason I am pleased that the Senate has today passed the Conference Report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), H.R. 2281. 
Title I of the DMCA will implement the two World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) copyright treaties. These treaties will fortify intellectual property rights around the world and will help unleash the full potential of America's most creative industries, including the computer software, publishing, movie, recording and other copyrighted industries that are subject to online piracy. By insuring better protection of the creative works available online, the DMCA will also encourage the continued growth of the Internet and the global information infrastructure. It will encourage the ingenuity of the American people, and will send a powerful message to intellectual property pirates that we will not tolerate theft. 
I should note that there are provisions in Title I that address certain technologies used to control copying of motion pictures in analog form on video cassette recorders which were not part of either the original Senate or House DMCA bills. These provisions establish certain requirements only for analog videocassette recorders, analog videocassette camcorders and professional analog videocassette recorders. It is my understanding that these provisions do not establish any obligations with respect to digital technologies, including computers or software. 
It is also my understanding that the intent of the conferees is that these provisions neither establish, nor should be interpreted as establishing, a precedent for Congress to legislate specific standards or specific technologies to be used as technological protection measures, particularly with respect to computers and software. Generally, Congress should not establish technology specific rules; technology develops best and most rapidly in response to marketplace forces. 
Title II of the DMCA will limit the infringement liability of online service providers. This title is intended to preserve incentives for online service providers and copyright owners to cooperate to detect and address copyright infringements that occur in the digital networked environment. 
Title III will provide a minor, yet important, clarification in section 117 of the Copyright Act to ensure that the lawful owner or lessee of a computer machine may authorize an independent service provider, a person unaffiliated with either the owner or lessee of the machine, to activate the machine for the sole purpose of servicing its hardware components. 
Title IV will begin to update our nation's copyright laws with respect to library, archives, and educational uses of copyrighted works in a digital environment. It includes provisions relating to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks and the Register of Copyrights, and clarifies the role of the Copyright Office. It also addresses the assumption of contractual obligations related to the transfer of rights in motion pictures. Finally, this title creates a fair and efficient licensing mechanism to address the complex issues facing copyright owners and users of copyrighted materials as a result of the rapid growth of digital audio services. 
Title V, the `Vessel Hull Design Protection Act,' creates a new form of sui generis intellectual property protection for vessel hull designs. By adoption of this title, however, the Conferees wisely took no position on the advisability or propriety of adopting broader design protection for other useful articles. Indeed, when broad industrial design legislation was considered by the Congress in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of legitimate concerns were raised about the effects such legislation would have, particularly on the cost of auto repairs. Establishing narrow protection for vessel hulls in the conference report should not be interpreted as signaling support, or setting a precedent, for broader design protection that could negatively affect the ability of consumers to obtain economical, quality auto repairs. 
The Senate today is passing a balanced and important package. Certain issues that the House had included in the version it passed on August 4, 1998, were eliminated to allow consideration of the rest of the package in a timely manner. 
One of the issues dropped was that of database protection. Title V of the House passed DMCA bill created a new federal prohibition against the misappropriation of databases that are the product of substantial investment, with both civil remedies and criminal penalties. The argument for enhanced database protection is that legal rulings and technological developments have eroded protections against database theft. Companies may be able to copy significant portions of established databases and sell them, avoiding the substantial cost of creating and verifying the databases themselves. I appreciate that the threat to U.S. databases has been magnified because database protection laws recently implemented in European Union countries will not be available to U.S. publishers unless comparable legislation is enacted in the U.S. 
I have therefore been and continue to be supportive of legislation to provide database producers with adequate protection from database piracy. 
I am also sensitive, however, to the concerns about the House-passed database bill that were raised by the Administration, the libraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific community. The Department of Justice, in a memorandum dated July 28, 1998, concluded that the House passed database bill, H.R. 2652, which was later incorporated in Title V of the House DMCA, raised difficult and novel constitutional questions. 
The Department of Commerce has also advised me that while the Administration supports legal protection against commercial misappropriation of collections of information, the Administration has a number of concerns with H.R. 2652, including that the Constitution imposes significant constraints upon Congress' power to enact legislation of this sort. 
Just this week, the Department of Commerce told me in a letter that:  
Given the critical importance of implementing the WIPO treaties, and the short time remaining in the Session, we urge the Conferees to focus on issues germane to these treaties, rather than unrelated matters. 
Although there was not enough time before the end of this Congress to give this important issue due consideration, it is my hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will promptly commence hearings on the issue and move expeditiously to enact further legislation on the matter at the beginning of the 106th Congress. The work that the Committee did this year on the issue should be viewed as a beginning, and we are committed to making more progress as quickly as possible. 
The legislation that the Senate passed today is the culmination of several years' work, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that the appropriate copyright protections are in place around the world to foster the enormous growth of the Internet and other digital computer networks. 
Much of the credit for this legislation is due to the hard work and dedication of the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. This is another example of when we work together, we get good things done. It was also a pleasure to serve on the Conference with Senator Thurmond, former Chairman the Senate Judiciary Committee and a force in his own right. 
The Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee--Chairman Hyde and Congressman Conyers--and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property--Chairman Coble and Congressman Frank--deserve particular recognition and praise for their fine work. Although Congressman Frank was not on the Conference Committee, his tremendous efforts on behalf of the WIPO implementing language as well as on the other matters in the DMCA are very much appreciated. Congressman Goodlatte and Berman also contributed considerable time and talent to the benefit of all who participated in the process. 
Although I had not previously had the pleasure of working on WIPO with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Commerce Committee--Chairman Bliley and Congressman Dingell--or the Chairman of the Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, Chairman Tauzin, I would like to acknowledge their significant contributions to the final package. 
The staff of all of the Conferees deserve special recognition. Manus Cooney, Edward Damich, Troy Dow, Garry Malphrus, Mitch Glazier, Debbie Laman, Robert Raben, Bari Schwartz, David Lehman, Ben Cline, Justin Lilley, Andy Levin, Mike O'Rielly, and Whitney Fox spent countless hours on this bill, when it was pending in Committee, on the floor and, finally, in conference. Without their labor and talent, we would not be here today considering the DMCA. 
The DMCA also reflects the recommendations and hard work of the Copyright Office. Specifically, Marybeth Peters, Shira Perlmutter, David Carson, Jesse Feder, Carolina Saez, Sayuri Rajapakse, Rachel Goslins and Jule Sigall were invaluable on this legislation. The Copyright Office was there at every step along the way--from the negotiation of the WIPO treaties to the negotiations and the drafting of the implementing legislation and the other issues in the DMCA. Given their expertise in copyright law, they will play a significant role in the implementation of the legislation, particularly with regards to the rulemaking on the circumvention of technological measures that effectively control access to a copyrighted work and the studies mandated by the bill. 
The Clinton Administration deserves praise for the role it played in making this legislation a reality. I would especially like to thank Secretary Daley, Andy Pincus, Ellen Bloom, Jennifer Conovitz and Justin Hughes of the Department of Commerce, as well as Brian Kahin and Thomas Kalil for all of their hard work on the DMCA. 
From my perspective, those who deserve the most thanks are my Judiciary Committee staff who have assisted me during the hearings, debates, negotiations, and conference on this bill. Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell and Marla Grossman have worked tirelessly to ensure that this bill was well crafted and lived up to its promise. 
This legislation is an important step for protecting American ingenuity and creative expression. It addresses the needs of creators, consumers and commerce in the digital age and well into the next century. I am proud that the Senate has passed this legislation today. 
Mr. President, so Senators will know, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah and I spent enormous amounts of time on this piece of legislation working to get us to this point. We both share great concerns about the database part. We understood that we would not be able to get the bill passed had that stayed in the bill. 
The distinguished Senator from Utah and I will work between the time we go out and the time we come back in January to put together database legislation. There will be a strong effort, I know, on my side of the aisle, as there will be on his. We hope the Senate will be able to vote on that and the House, too, early next year. I say this because I do not want anybody to think that this has now disappeared because the rest of the legislation has gone through. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate will pass the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, S. 2022, sending it to the President for his signature into law. 
I am proud to join Senator DeWine in supporting our bipartisan legislation to authorize comprehensive Department of Justice grants to every state for criminal justice identification, information and communications technologies and systems. I applaud the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for his leadership. I also commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Leader for their strong support of the Crime Identification Technology Act. 
I know from my experience in law enforcement in Vermont over the last 30 years that access to quality, accurate information in a timely fashion is of vital importance. As we prepare to enter the 21st Century, we must provide our state and local law enforcement officers with the resources to develop the latest technological tools and communications systems to solve and prevent crime. I believe this bill accomplishes that goal. 
The Crime Identification Technology Act authorizes $250 million for each of the next five years in grants to states for crime information and identification systems. The Attorney General is directed to make grants to each state to be used in conjunction with units of local government, and other states, to use information and identification technologies and systems to upgrade criminal history and criminal justice record systems. 
Grants made under our legislation may include programs to establish, develop, update or upgrade---- 
State, centralized, automated criminal history record information systems, including arrest and disposition reporting; 
Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; 
Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize fingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible with systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of Investigation; 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index (III); 
Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact; 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility determinations; 
Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and communicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, prosecution, and corrections; 
Non-criminal history record information systems relevant to firearms eligibility determinations for availability and accessibility to the NICs; 
Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting of dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI and to promote the compatibility with, and integration of, court systems with other criminal justice information systems; 
Ballistics identification programs that are compatible and integrated with the ballistics programs of the National Integrated Ballistics Network (NIBN); 
Information, identification and communications programs for forensic purposes; 
DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes; Sexual offender identification and registration systems; Domestic violence offender identification and information systems; 
Programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal justice purposes including youth service employees and volunteers and other individuals in positions of trust, if authorized by federal or state law and administered by a government agency; 
Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide statistical and research products including incident-based reporting systems and uniform crime reports; 
Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and programs; and 
Multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional communications systems to share routine and emergency information among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 
Let me just give a couple of examples from my home State of Vermont that illustrate how our comprehensive legislation will aid state and local law enforcement agencies across the country. 
The future of law enforcement must focus on working together to harness the power of today's information age to prevent crime and catch criminals. One way to work together is for State and local law enforcement agencies to band together to create efficiencies of scale. For example, together with New Hampshire and Maine, the State of Vermont has pooled its resources together to build a tri-State IAFIS system to identify fingerprints. Our bipartisan legislation would foster these partnerships by allowing groups of States to apply together for grants. 
Another challenge for law enforcement agencies across the country is communication difficulties between Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials. In a recent report, the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice concluded that law enforcement agencies throughout the Nation lack adequate communications systems to respond to crimes that cross State and local jurisdictions. 
A 1997 incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border underscored this problem. During a cross border shooting spree that left four people dead including two New Hampshire State Troopers, Vermont and New Hampshire officers were forced to park two police cruisers next to one another to coordinate activities between Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers because the two States' police radios could not communicate with one another. 
The Vermont Department of Public Safety, the Vermont U.S. Attorney's Office and others have reacted to these communication problems by developing the Northern Lights proposal. This project will allow the northern borders States of Vermont, New York, New Hampshire, and Maine to integrate their law enforcement communications systems to better coordinate interdiction efforts and share intelligence data seamlessly. 
Our legislation would provide grants for the development of integrated Federal, State, and local law enforcement communications systems to foster cutting edge efforts like the Northern Lights project. 
In addition, our bipartisan legislation will help each of our States meet its obligations under national anti-crime initiatives. For instance, the FBI will soon bring online NCIC 2000 and IAFIS which will require States to update their criminal justice systems for the country to benefit. States are also being asked to participate in several other national programs such as sexual offender registries, national domestic violence legislation, Brady Act, and National Child Protection Act. 
Currently, there are no comprehensive programs to support these national crime-fighting systems. Our legislation will fill this void by helping each State meet its obligations under these Federal laws. 
The Crime Identification Technology Act provides a helping hand without the heavy hand of a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach. Unfortunately, some in Congress have pushed legislation mandating minute detail changes that States must make in their laws to qualify for Federal funds. Our bill rejects this approach. Instead, we provide the States with Federal support to improve their criminal justice identification, information and communication systems without prescriping new Federal mandates. 
Mr. President, I am also pleased we are passing, as title II of this bill, the Federal-State `III' Compact for exchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes. This Compact is the product of a decade-long effort by federal and state law enforcement officials to establish a legal framework for the exchange of criminal history records for authorized noncriminal justice purposes, such as security clearances, employment or licensing background checks. 
Since 1924, the FBI has collected and maintained duplicate state and local fingerprint cards, along with arrest and disposition records. Today, the FBI has over 200 million fingerprint cards in its system. These FBI records are accessible to authorized government entities for both criminal and authorized noncriminal justice purposes. 
Maintaining duplicate files at the FBI is costly and leads to inaccuracies in the criminal history records, since follow-up disposition information from the States is often incomplete. Such a large central database of routinely incomplete criminal history records raises significant privacy concerns. 
In addition, the FBI releases these records for noncriminal justice purposes (as authorized by Federal law), to State agencies upon request, even if the State from which the records originated or the receiving State more narrowly restricts the dissemination of such records for noncriminal justice purposes. 
The Compact is an effort to get the FBI out of the business of holding a duplicate copy of every State and local criminal history record, and instead to keep those records at the State level. Once fully implemented, the FBI will only need to hold the Interstate Identification Index (III), consisting of the national fingerprint file and a pointer index to direct the requestor to the correct State records repository. The Compact would eliminate the necessity for duplicate records at the FBI for those States participating in the Compact. 
Eventually, when all the States become full participants in the Compact, the FBI's centralized files of state offender records will be discontinued and users of such records will obtain those records from the appropriate State's central repository (or from the FBI if the offender has a Federal record). 
The Compact would establish both a framework for this cooperative exchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes, and create a Compact Council with representatives from the FBI and the States to monitor system operations and issue necessary rules and procedures for the integrity and accuracy of the records and compliance with privacy standards. Importantly, this Compact would not in any way expand or diminish noncriminal justice purposes for which criminal history records may be used under existing State or Federal law. 
Overall, I believe that the Compact would increase the accuracy, completeness and privacy protection for criminal history records. 
In addition, the Compact would result in important cost savings from establishing a decentralized system. Under the system envisioned by the Compact, the FBI would hold only an `index and pointer' to the records maintained at the originating State. The FBI would no longer have to maintain duplicate State records. Moreover, States would no longer have the burden and costs of submitting arrest fingerprints and charge/disposition data to the FBI for all arrests. Instead, the State would only have to submit to the FBI the fingerprints and textual identification data for a person's first arrest. 
With this system, criminal history records would be more up-to-date, or complete, because a decentralized system will keep the records closer to their point of origin in State repositories, eliminating the need for the States to keep sending updated disposition information to the FBI. To ensure further accuracy, the Compact would require requests for criminal history checks for noncriminal justice purposes to be submitted with fingerprints or some other form of positive identification, to avoid mistaken release of records. 
Furthermore, under the Compact, the newly-created Council must establish procedures to require that the most current records are requested and that when a new need arises, a new record check is conducted. 
Significantly, the newly-created Council must establish privacy enhancing procedures to ensure that requested criminal history records are only used by authorized officials for authorized purposes. Furthermore, the Compact makes clear that only the FBI and authorized representatives from the State repository may have direct access to the FBI index. 
The Council must also ensure that only legally appropriate information is released and, specifically, that record entries that may not be used for noncriminal justice purposes are deleted from the response. 
Thus, while the Compact would require the release of arrest records to a requesting State, the Compact would also ensure that if disposition records are available that the complete record be released. Also, the Compact would require States receiving records under the Compact to ensure that the records are disseminated in compliance with the authorized uses in that State. Consequently, under the Compact, a State that receives arrest-only information would have to give effect to disposition-only policies in that State and not release that information for noncriminal justice purposes. Thus, in my view, the impact of the Compact for the privacy and accuracy of the records would be positive. 
I am pleased to have joined with Senators Hatch and DeWine to make a number of refinements to the Compact as transmitted by to us by the Administration. Specifically, we have worked to clarify that (1) the work of the Council includes establishing standards to protect the privacy of the records; (2) sealed criminal history records are not covered or subject to release for noncriminal justice purposes under the Compact; (3) the meetings of the Council are open to the public, and (4) the Council's decisions, rules and procedures are available for public inspection and copying and published in the Federal Register. 
Commissioner Walton of the Vermont Department of Public Safety supports this Compact. He hopes that passage of the Compact will encourage Vermont to become a full participant in III for both criminal and noncriminal justice purposes, so that Vermont can `reap the benefits of cost savings and improved data quality.' The Compact is also strongly supported by the FBI and SEARCH. 
We all have an interest in making sure that the criminal history records maintained by our law enforcement agencies at the local, State and Federal levels, are complete, accurate and accessible only to authorized personnel for legally authorized purposes. This Compact is a significant step in the process of achieving that goal. 
I know that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Reno's leadership, has made it a priority to modernize and automate criminal history records. Our legislation will continue that leadership by providing each State with the necessary resources to continue to make important efforts to bring their criminal justice systems up to date. 
Mr. President, the Crime Identification Technology Act will ensure that each State has the resources to capture the power of emerging information, communications and record-keeping technologies to serve and protect all of our citizens.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief on this. There was another unanimous consent request just now to which the distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska objected. I join in that objection. The Senator from Nebraska is a distinguished veteran. In fact, he is the only person I have ever served with in either body that has been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He is a servant of his country in every sense of the word. 
Mr. President, the reason we were objecting is not that people would hesitate to vote on this, but a 2-hour proposal is not realistic. We are dealing here with a proposal to amend the Constitution of the United States. That is something that, as Madison put it, should be reserved for `certain great and extraordinary occasions.' 
This is a serious issue--one deserving of our full attention, our most thoughtful consideration, and our most serious debate. Instead, we are asked to consider this at the most hectic time of the entire legislative calendar--at the end of a session when the attention of Senators quite properly is focused on passing the necessary appropriations bills so that we will not once again shut down the Federal Government. This is inappropriate timing. I might say that it is entirely unnecessary. 
This amendment was reported by the Judiciary Committee on June 24, over 3 months ago. The committee report was sent to the Senate on September 1, over a month ago. This amendment could have been brought up at any time. 
I ask, why is it being proposed to be brought up now? It would be nothing less than irresponsible for us to consider it in the short, hectic time line that is available. As if this matter could be made worse, we are asked to consider it not only during 2 hours of debate, but also when one of our most distinguished colleagues, also a distinguished veteran of World War II and of the Korean conflict, Senator Glenn, necessarily is absent on a dangerous and important project on behalf of the Nation. 
Frankly--I don't want to interrupt the conversation going on to the right of me, Mr. President. So I will withhold for a moment.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
No one has fought harder for the flag than John Glenn. No one has fought harder than he to protect the Bill of Rights. It shocks and really offends me that the proponents of this amendment would take advantage of his absence to debate this proposal as he embarks once again in harm's way in the service of the United States. 
I am astounded to have something as important as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States called up at this late date in the session. We are less than a week away from adjournment. We have important work to do--work that cannot wait. And to call this up seems even less responsible when you consider the restraint of some of our other Members. 
This is not the only constitutional amendment pending before the Congress. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, have worked long and hard on an amendment to the Constitution to deal with the rights of victims of crime. While I have not supported that amendment and very much am for a statutory approach to that important issue, I know that it was propounded in a responsible fashion. Both Senator Kyl and Senator Feinstein came to the floor just a few days ago, on September 28, to acknowledge that as much as they support the amendment, there simply is not time left in the session to consider it properly. 
The Senator from Arizona made this point: `It has been very difficult in the waning days of the session to get floor time to take up even the most mundane of bills, because the Senate is very much concentrated on getting the appropriations bills passed so that we can fund the Government.' He went on to note: `We understood that for something as important as amending the Constitution we want to do it right. The last thing Senator Feinstein and I would ever do is hurry an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to try to push this through without an adequate debate without giving everyone an opportunity to have their say.' 
The last thing we would ever do, as these two distinguished Senators said, is to hurry an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Frankly, that should be the last thing any U.S. Senator should do--Republican or Democrat. But to ask to consider an amendment to the Constitution that would for the first time in our history cut back on the First Amendment and to propose that the Senate do so under a 2-hour time agreement would be just that. It comes across as just politics. 
The sponsor of this amendment, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, told reporters last Friday that he did not have the votes to win it, that this amendment was not going to pass. If it is not going to pass, why are we even being asked to bring it up as a constitutional amendment in these waning days? It is because it is not a question of passing this amendment that the request is being made. It is to get some material for a campaign commercial. It is for a sound bite, for 30-second attack ads, politics at its worst. It has less to do with passing an amendment than with avoiding things that we should be doing, like HMO reform, or protecting the Social Security system, or protecting veterans' health care. 
In the closing days of a session, where Congress has not passed a budget, which was required to be passed by April 15, where both sides flirt with the idea of what might happen with another Government shutdown, we should be completing the matters that must be completed this week. 
Obviously, there will be amendments that may come up from all sides for political points. But the one place that should be off limits for such political points is the Constitution of the United States--this short and powerful document that holds the greatest democracy history has ever known together. We should not trivialize it by talking about a 2-hour debate to amend it. 
Mr. President, even as we speak here today, this Congress is facing a major test of our Constitution just down the hall in the other body. This is a test that no matter how one looks at it, no matter what position one takes, whether that of special prosecutor Starr, that of the President, or that of anybody else, the American people, no matter how they feel about this, have some sense that the bedrock of our country is our Constitution, and somehow the Constitution, if upheld by 535 people, men and women who are sworn in a most solemn oath to uphold that Constitution, that somehow the Constitution will pull us through. 
Mr. President, having said that, I believe that no matter how much politics may or may not get played, that in the end the American people will be justified in relying on us and the Constitution. But we do not give them hopes in that if we in turn trivialize the Constitution. 
At one time this year, I am told, there were over 100 amendments filed in the Congress to the Constitution--over 100 amendments. Somehow some feel that Congress should be considering over 100 amendments and asking this great country to consider 100 amendments to its Constitution. 
Mr. President, the genius of our Constitution and the reason why this democracy has been able to survive is that we have been very careful about amending it--extremely careful about amending it, because we like the integrity of it, the consistency of it, and in some ways the comfort of a Constitution that we know so well. 
So we should never hurry through an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. We should never try to push one through without an adequate debate. We should never try to do it without giving everyone an opportunity to have their say. Especially today, Mr. President, with the crisis the country faces, we of all people--the Members of the U.S. Senate--should make it very clear to the country that we revere the Constitution, and that, whatever else we may get involved in with regard to politics, the Constitution will not be part of that. 
There are over a quarter billion Americans--over a quarter of a billion Americans. Only 100 of us get the opportunity to serve in this Chamber at any time. The seat I now hold, in the last 58 years only two Vermonters have held this seat. I am one of the two in 58 years. It is a great privilege. Frankly, it is one that humbles me every day when I come to work. I still feel the same thrill coming up this Hill and coming into this Chamber as I felt when I was a day away from being a 34-year-old prosecutor in Vermont and was the junior-most Member of the U.S. Senate. 
Part of that thrill is to know that it is a rare opportunity, a rare privilege, an honor that I have never been absolutely sure I deserve, but one I cherish, given to me by the people of Vermont to represent them and to speak as one of the 100 voices for this country, 
in full knowledge that there will be somebody else outstanding at this seat who will also represent my State of Vermont and the United States. But I hope that they will carry with them the same reverence for the Constitution that I feel I carry. There will be times to amend the Constitution. We did it after the tragic death of President Kennedy to allow for the succession of a Vice President. Time showed the necessity for it and the American public came together and knew the need for it. 
But let us make it very clear how we feel about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, as the 100 who hold this responsibility, so that the American people know that if we are going to change our Constitution, we will do it with real debate and real consideration, and all 100 of us will be able to stand up on this floor and vote. 
Now, the entire Senate has known--in fact, the Nation has known--for weeks that Senator Glenn would be unavailable this week, and certainly that alone would be a reason not to bring this up now. Senator Glenn is one of the most distinguished Americans of all time. He obviously should have a chance to vote on this. So I am glad the Senator from Nebraska has lodged the objection he did. I concur with it. I have voted on this proposed constitutional amendment before. I am not afraid to do so again. But the First Amendment, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights deserve more than cursory attention. 
Let us all make it clear to the people of this country that the Constitution stands first and foremost. We serve here only for the time our States allow us to serve. The Constitution predated us and will be here after us. 
I see the distinguished majority leader once again in the Chamber, and so I will yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, I have worked on each one of these pieces of legislation so much. There are times when I have attempted to pull out what little bit of hair I have left, and, frankly, I hope we can move this. I will personally go to anybody who is lodging objection to see what I can do to clear it up, because I absolutely concur with the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, that this is something which should be moved forward; we want to move it forward. I hope I can tell the distinguished majority leader within a few minutes we do have it cleared.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am delighted that the Senate is finally considering the Copyright Term Extension Act. 
Copyright has been the engine that has traditionally converted the energy of artistic creativity into publicly available art and entertainment. Historically, government's role has been to encourage creativity and innovation by protecting rights that create incentives for such activity through copyright. 
On July 1, 1995, the European Union issued a directive to its member countries mandating a copyright term of 20 years longer than the term in the U.S. As a result, the E.U. will not have to guard American works beyond the American term limit, whereas European works will have 20 years more security and revenues in the marketplace. 
The songwriter Carlos Santana put it eloquently in his statement submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee three years ago on this subject, `As an American songwriter whose works are performed throughout the world, I find it unacceptable that I am accorded inferior copyright protection in the world marketplace.' 
His reasons are as relevant today as the day he made that statement. The 1998 Report on Copyright Industries in the U.S. Economy issued by the International Intellectual Property Alliance indicates just how important the U.S. copyright industries are today to American jobs and the economy and, therefore, how important it is for the U.S. to give its copyright industries at least the level of protection that is enjoyed by European Union industries. 
The Report indicates that from the years 1977 through 1996, the U.S. copyright industries' share of the gross national product grew more than twice as fast as the remainder of the economy. During those same 20 years, job growth in core copyright industries was nearly three times the employment growth in the economy as a whole. These statistics underscore why it is so important that we finally pass this legislation today. 
I cosponsored the original Senate copyright term legislation, the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995, S. 483. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on that bill on September 20, 1995. At that hearing, we heard the testimony of Marybeth Peters, Register of Copyrights, and Bruce Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office. We also heard testimony of Jack Valenti, President and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, Alan Menken, a composer and lyricist, Patrick Alger, President of the Nashville Songwriters Association International, and Peter Jaszi, Professor at American University, Washington, College of Law. That bill was favorably reported to the Senate, and the Committee filed its report, Senate Report No. 104-315, on May 23, 1996. 
Alert to the possibility that copyright term extension could impose unintended costs, I, along with Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Brown and Simpson, asked Marybeth Peters, Register of Copyrights, and Daniel Mulhollan, Director of Congressional Research Service, to conduct a study and issue a report to Congress on the financial implications of copyright term extension. The Congressional Research Service issued its report on February 17, 1998, and the Copyright Office issued its report February 23, 1998. 
This Congress, I introduced the Copyright Term Extension Act, S. 505, on March 20, 1997, along with Senators Hatch, D'Amato, Thompson, Abraham and Feinstein. Despite the merits of passing copyright term extension legislation, the bill has been held hostage to other matters far too long. In the global world of the next century, competition in the realm of intellectual property will reach a ferocity even more ruthless than it is today. Congress should equip American creators with a full measure of protection for their copyrighted works, else U.S. intellectual property owners are reduced in their reach and their effectiveness. I am therefore pleased that the Senate is finally considering the Copyright Term Extension Act, and I urge its passage.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently a publication from St. Michael's College in Winooski Park, Colchester, VT, profiled Professor Edward Pfeifer. Dr. Pfeifer is referred to as `Historian Ed Pfeifer, '43.' I have always thought of Ed Pfeifer as the special mentor I had in college and the man who did so much to shape my thinking and my life after college. 
He was the kind of professor who not only helped you learn, but taught you to want to learn. He would find students he could mentor and introduce them to the joys of learning. Fortunately, I was one of those students and I have benefited from his help every day since. 
Ed and his wife, Joan, are now retired in Vermont. One of the great pleasures Marcelle and I have is when we end up in the same place with them, ranging from events at St. Michael's, to meeting in the grocery store near our own home in Vermont.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my very good friend, Robert Lanctot, died after a courageous bout with cancer. Bob, and his wife Betty, were two very special friends of my wife and I. 
When I first ran for the Senate in 1974, Bob helped me in an area of the state where no Democrat could ever expect to get votes. Everybody told him I couldn't win, but he persevered and not only did I win, but went on in subsequent elections to carry the area significantly. I have always felt that a large part of that was do to Bob Lanctot.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge all Members to keep in mind the necessity to have a strong sense of history in whatever position they take on this matter. It is not something that is done for a 30-second spot on an ad, nor is it something that is done to determine the fate of any one of us in an election whether this year or subsequent years. Whatever we do affects the history and the course of the greatest democracy history has ever known. 
In that regard, I believe Members will be wise to take the time to read an op-ed piece written by former President Gerald Ford from the New York Times on Sunday, October 4. After reading it, I was impressed enough to pick up the phone and call President Ford and speak to him at some length. 
I had the privilege, when I was first a Member of the Senate, of serving with President Ford. I got to know him then. On many occasions in the 20 or so years since, I have been able to be with him or talk with him or seek his advice. I think what he says here is, again, very worthwhile. It may not be something that each Member would agree with. I find a great deal of merit in it. Again, President Ford speaks not only of the history involved, but of the country and of his own long experiences as a Member of the House. I commend every one of us to read President Ford's op-ed piece.

Mr. LEAHY. Yes, I do agree. 
It is my understanding that USDA collects substantial fees from those bison ranchers and processing firms for Federal inspection. It is my understanding that this fee is set yearly by USDA and that it is approximately $41 per hour. I believe that these fees directly impact thousands of small ranchers who belong to the National Bison Association.

Mr. LEAHY. We have bison ranchers in my state and in every other State in the country. I agree with the Senator that while we are looking for policies and programs that help small farmers and ranchers, we look carefully at all other actions that could make a difference. I believe that the issue of inspection fees charged bison producers should be explored by the Department of Agriculture, and that the Department should provide us with their analysis of this impact early in 1999.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if ironies were flowers the area inside the Washington beltway would be covered with fields of flowers sprouting out of every square inch of land. 
I am surprised that many of the same Senators who say they want farmers to receive higher income for what they produce strongly oppose the same for other farmers if the product is not produced in their home states. 
Many Senators have recently spoken on the floor about the disaster facing their farmers. Some have likened it to losses caused by natural disasters such as Hurricanes. Regarding this farm disaster, their biggest concern is the huge loss in farm income. The culprit this time is low prices and the loss of farm income. 
In speech after speech many complain that their farmers face low prices--and thus low income. And, as is so often said, farmers do not want welfare they want higher income for their labors. These Senators assert that farmers do not just want a handout--they want higher prices so they can earn an reasonable income and stay in business. 
Whether the commodity is wheat, soybeans, corn, or other feedgrains we hear time and time again that prices are too low--and thus their farmers may go out of business. 
There is a sense of great panic in the farm community. It is real. I am advised that farm income in some areas has been reduced by 98 percent. I have been moved by many of the compelling descriptions of the agony faced by these farm families. I am concerned about this even though my home state of Vermont is not as directly affected. 
Thomas Paine made an interesting comment about these situations which is still as true today as is was in 1776. He said: `Panics, in some cases, have their uses. . . . their peculiar advantage is, that they are the touchstone of sincerity and hypocrisy, and bring things and men to light, which might otherwise have lain forever undiscovered.' 
There is indeed a touch of hypocrisy in this crisis. Some, including some at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, see the loan deficiency payments as a great solution. If prices drop below a target price the farmers get the difference between their market price and this target price. If prices increase above a certain level then the farmers cannot receive this cash payment. Recently I twice voted for these proposals along with every Democratic Senator save one. 
I do think this approach is a good idea and I hope in the end it is included in any continuing resolution we work out. It is important that any income relief in the resolution be targeted to 1998 year crop production and that it go to producers, not mere landowners. 
Many strongly support this approach for commodities produced by their farmers. However, if the benefit is to be provided to farmers not producing their commodities some turn a deaf ear. This is an unfortunate irony--some will not listen to the very arguments they use to support additional income to their farmers if other commodities are involved. I voted for their solution even though it is of little benefit to my home state of Vermont. Turning a deaf ear toward farm problems in other areas of the country raises a lot of concerns. 
The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is the perfect example. The major benefit of the compact is to provide income to farmers when milk prices are low--income is not provided to farmers when prices rise past a certain point. The amount of the payment a farmer gets depends on how far milk prices are below the target price. You could simply repeat those two sentences but substitute the word `corn,' `soybeans' or `wheat,' or whichever commodity, for `milk' and you have described how the loan deficiency payment system works. 
Many certainly want this benefit for their commodities. Some Senators would rather their farmers get a check for increased `freedom to farm payments' instead of cash payments called loan deficiency payments. In this way these Senators provide cash to feedgrains producers to make up for the fact that farm prices are so low. Either way, almost all Senators want farmers to receive some additional cash payments. And farms families deserve this. 
But try to apply this system to milk prices and many Members of Congress and some in the Administration say `no.' 
This is a major issue for me since more than 70 percent of all farm income in my state is from dairy. Vermont is first in the nation in terms of the relative importance of dairy to total farm income. This is why the Compact is crucial to me. 
Dairy farmers like other farmers work hard--milking cows early in the morning, moving cows around to pasture, feeding them, worrying about veterinary bills. I wish we could all work together on this matter--all areas of the country--and support farm income for all producers. 
I freely admit that the Compact does give dairy farmers a lot more income when prices are low. It is supposed to do that--just like loan deficiency payments. We are not concealing the fact that during the first 6 months of operation OMB reported that `New England dairy farm income rose by an estimated $22-27 million . . . .' 
Several Senators from the Upper Midwest insisted that OMB do a study on the effects of the Compact. The OMB report is called the `The Economic Effects of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.' I will be quoting a lot from that study that those Senators wanted in this floor statement. 
As a little background, the Interstate Dairy Compact Commission with 26 delegates appointed by the six governors is authorized to determine a `target price'--$16.94/cwt in this case. Under the Compact language approved by the six states any state can opt-out temporarily--until a later date that the state determines--or opt-in and receive that additional income for producers. The Compact is voluntary, it is up to each state. 
As I just pointed out in this respect, when prices are low the effect of the Compact is similar to the loan deficiency payments made under marketing loan programs in that, roughly speaking, producers get the difference between a `capped' target amount and the current price. When farm prices are high, no cash payments are made to producers under the Compact. 
Why is this additional income for dairy farmers as justifiable as additional income--whether in the form of loan deficiency payments or increased freedom to farm payments--for feedgrain farmers? The answer is simple--it keeps their families on the farm. All farmers deserve to earn a decent income for their families. 
This additional income to farmers in New England based on the Compact has kept farmers in business. For example, news articles have focused on how in Connecticut and Vermont the rate of farm loss is much less than before the Compact went into effect. Before the Compact, OMB reports that New England suffered a `20-percent decline' in the number of farms with milk cows from 1990 to 1996. Now, this horrible rate of attrition has stopped. I wish other states could also stop their loss of farm families. I have supported reasonable efforts to keep family farmers in business throughout our country and will insist on that in any continuing resolution. 
It is clear that efforts to keep dairy farmers in business will become more critical over time since, as OMB reports, `the Farm Bill also calls for the termination of many elements of USDA's current dairy program by January 2000.' Also, dairy producers do not receive any so-called `freedom to farm payments" for milk production and the milk support program will be terminated in the year 2000. 
Also, since dairy farmers sell a perishable fluid product that needs refrigeration they are not able to hold product off the market until they can get a better price. Feedgrains can be and are stored to get a better price--indeed the government will even give you a loan based on the value of the grain you are storing. This provides farmers with cash to pay bills--this program is not available regarding the production of milk. 
Of course, by taking this grain off the market this can have the effect of increasing grain prices. FAPRI has provided Congress with information on these anticipated increases in grain prices based on the marketing loan program. 
One disadvantage to increasing the caps in marketing loan programs, or increasing freedom to farm payments, is that it costs taxpayers a bundle--in this case several billion dollars. I voted for the marketing loan proposals twice because I think it is worth it to increase farm income in Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri and a number of other states. While marketing loan programs do not benefit New England dairy farmers, I have always felt that farmers should stick together and help each other out. I wish more Members of Congress felt that way. 
I am very willing to work with my Colleagues from the Upper Midwest to try to figure a way so that all of us can work together. But I will insist on one thing--that our goal should be to protect income for dairy farmers and to keep farmers in business. I do have some ideas that I think we can all agree upon and want to sit down with my Colleagues from the Upper Midwest, and around the country, to work something out. 
I will support reasonable programs that benefit their farmers, as I do farmers in others states and as I do for other commodities. 
As long as I am on the subject of the Compact I want to make a few additional points about how well it is working. 
First, I want to thank many of the Members of Congress who want to support farm income for all farmers--not just farmers producing feedgrains. I am very pleased that the Compact will get a short extension in the appropriations bill. Some opponents have begun complaining that it is included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. It was included in the House bill and is now included in the Conference Report. 
I am very pleased with this since the 1996 farm bill created a three-year Compact pilot project for the Northeast. However, long delays in implementing the Compact by USDA have cut that three-year period down to less than two years. That is not what the Congress had in mind when it passed a three-year time period in 1996. I am pleased that this Appropriations Bill will extend the Compact at least until September 30, 1999, so that the Congress can find out how well it has served farmers. Even with this extension, the time-period is less than Congress set forth in 1996. 
It is interesting that one of my distinguished Colleagues blasted the Compact on the Senate floor by saying that dairy farmers have not seen positive benefits as a result of the compact. What surprises me about this statement is that most dairy farmers would say that a significant increase in their income over a six-month period was a `positive benefit.' 
Maybe things are different in the Upper Midwest but New England farmers like this increase in income and consider higher income a positive benefit. It could be that since New England only produces three percent of the fluid milk in the nation that an increase of $22 million to $27 million in income over a six month period, according to OMB, is not considered large by Upper Midwest standards. 
I also disagree with the complaint that under the Compact `consumers have been hurt by higher prices.' OMB has an answer for that which proves the value of the Compact. OMB reported after an initial increase in prices at some stores just as the Compact was implemented that: `New England retail milk prices by December [the sixth month after implementation] returned to the historical relationship to national levels, being about $0.05 per gallon lower.' 
So, OMB has concluded that consumer milk prices are lower in New England than the rest of the nation. I would like to repeat that--consumer prices in New England with the Compact are lower than national levels. I would encourage a study to check out that relationship now--I am very confident that prices in New England are still lower than the rest of the nation. 
The Connecticut Agriculture Commissioner Shirley Ferris reports, `In June of 1997, the month before the Compact took effect, the average retail price for a gallon of whole milk was $2.72. This June, almost a year after the Compact took effect, the price for a gallon of whole milk is only $2.73. And the price of a gallon of 1% milk is even less expensive now than before the Compact--$.03 less per gallon than last June.' 
Consumer milk prices, as economists had predicted, are lower in the Compact region than the average for the nation. 
Another interesting assertion--that milk consumption has dropped in the compact region--was made on the Senate floor recently. This is most odd since national data shows that the rate of milk consumption has dropped more in the rest of the nation than in the Compact region. 
According to the most recent A.C. Neilson Corporation marketing research data, U.S. gallon sales of fluid milk are down 1.8 percent compared to one year ago. New England gallon sales of fluid milk, however, have decreased by only 0.7 percent. National sales of fluid milk have declined 1.1 percent more than New England sales of fluid milk. 
In another assertion it was said that `The only real winners have been the largest industrial dairies of the Upper Northeast.' First of all, I am not certain if the use of Upper refers to Maine. Second, I am not certain what the `largest industrial dairies' means since our plants are so small compared to the Upper Midwest. 
And third, under the Compact, and as confirmed by the OMB study, it is the producers of milk, the farmers, who get the increase in income under the Compact. If anyone doubts that the dairy farmers in New England did not get increased pay checks someone should randomly call them on the phone and see if they really got the checks. I certainly have not heard complaints that the paychecks were lost in the mails. 
My distinguished Colleague also said that the Compact puts `traditional dairy farms' outside the region `at a competitive disadvantage.' OMB reports just the opposite. But again, you do not need an OMB report. Simply pick up the phone and call some dairy producers who live near the Compact region. They are selling milk into the region to take advantage of the Compact. If Wisconsin or Minnesota switched places with New York State, farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota would do the same--sell into the Compact region to make more income. 
While I do not know for sure, I suspect that dairy producers in Wisconsin and Minnesota would like more income for all their hard labor. Vermont dairy farmers and neighboring New York dairy farmers sure do. 
OMB reports there has been `an increase in milk shipments into New England equal to 8 percent.' This is not surprising since neighboring producers get higher prices for their milk in the compact region. 
Except for this benefit for neighboring farmers living just outside the Compact region, OMB reported that `New England has little effect on dairy markets outside its region, or on national prices or trends. . . . Its shipments outside the region in the form of cheese or milk are small.' 
Opponents of the Compact have constantly repeated that it would be a `trade barrier' on sales into New England. I could point to many statements to this effect on the floor. 
I predicted before the Compact was implemented, on the other hand, that since the law required that anyone could sell into the region and since the law required that these sellers get the benefit of the Compact, that there would be increased sales into the region. 
I was correct--and the evidence reported by OMB shows that neighboring farmers get the benefit of the higher Compact price and thus there has been an increase of sales into the region of 8 percent. 
This Compact has thus increased trade. Something that increases trade is not usually called a trade barrier. 
As an interesting footnote OMB reports that the Compact commission decided to provide additional money for New England WIC programs so that more eligible infants, children and pregnant women would be able to participate than would have participated without the Compact. The OMB report states that the `Compact could support a small increase in participation during the demonstration period.' The Commission has recently decided to provide additional funding to the school lunch programs. 
I also want to address the surplus production issue. As background, note that if New England regional milk production decreases less--or increases more--than the national rate, the farm bill requires that the Commission reimburse the federal government for the cost of Commodity Credit Corporation purchases of any `surplus production' that might occur. 
This year the Commission will pay a reimbursement as determined by the Secretary. Very favorable conditions in New England and low feedgrain prices and very unfavorable weather conditions throughout much of the rest of the country created this shift even though there was decrease--2,000 fewer--in cows milked from April to June 1998. 
As these relatively very unfavorable weather conditions in the rest of the country subside I expect that New England's rate of production will once again grow at a lower rate than the rest of the country--especially with the drop in cows milked in New England. Also note that almost all of the CCC purchases were of milk product from other regions of the country. 
To provide some perspective, I also wanted to mention that OMB reports that in 1996, `New England accounted for 2.93 percent of the Nation's milk production and 2.9 percent of its milk cows.' 
As the OMB report shows if other states had a dairy compact, farmers in those states could receive a significant increase in income. So why are some supporting billions' worth of increases in payments to farmers producing nondairy commodities but are opposed to increases in farm income to dairy farmers? 
The answer is easy. Sir Walter Scott knew many years ago that: `Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.' 
Corporate opponents of the Compact have tried to argue that this was a fight between consumers and farmers. The OMB study proves that consumer prices are lower in New England than the average for the rest of the country. So that is a false argument. 
The fight is actually between large manufacturers of milk products--large multinational corporations--and farmers. Manufacturers of any product, not just manufacturers of cheese or ice cream, want to buy their inputs as cheaply as possible. 
How do we know that? As with the answers to many questions all you have to do is follow the money. Who is buying ads and time to distort the truth? Who is staffing up to fight the Compact? And who mostly wants the Compact defeated? 
It certainly isn't farmers in areas that border the Compact region. They take advantage of the Compact's open invitation to trade--and make more money selling into the Compact region. 
It certainly isn't consumers since they get lower prices than the average for the rest of the nation. It certainly isn't farmers living in the region since they have gotten a significant boost in farm income. 
To find out the answer one just has to look at lobbying reports that have to be filed in Washington. Who funded efforts and hired people to oppose the Compact? 
Groups representing the large manufacturers of milk products--that's who. The International Dairy Food Association for example. Their members, like any manufacturers, want to buy their inputs at low cost. 
One of their members, Kraft, which is owned by a large tobacco company, wants to pass a bill that will allow them to buy milk at less than the price set by milk marketing orders through something called forward contracting. This could greatly increase their profits. 
They also oppose the dairy compact. The Compact has producers selling milk at more than the level set by milk marketing orders. Under the Dairy Compact, producers receive an over-order premium which means that they get more money than the minimum set by the order, not less. 
So why was there ever a concern about consumer prices increasing in the Compact region? Prices should have never increased. 
The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times discussed this in news articles about retail store price gouging. GAO raised the issue in 1991 and is looking at it now. 
We do know that retail prices for milk are often over double what farmers get for their milk--nationwide. Think about that. 
Lets look at the time period just before the compact took effect--and pick Vermont as the sample state. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, in `Are Grocers Getting Fat by Overcharging for Milk?,' beginning in November, 1996, the price that farmers got for their milk dropped by almost 25 percent--35 cents or so per gallon. Store prices stayed high which locked in a huge benefit to stores selling to consumers. 35 cents a gallon is a significant increase in benefits to retail stores. 
Comparing November 1996, to June 1997, the price farmers got for their milk dropped 35 cents a gallon, and stayed low, but the prices stores charged for milk stayed about the same. 
I have always contended that Dairy Compacts can help reduce this retail store price inflation by stabilizing the price that farmers get for milk--thus reducing the need for stores to build in a safety cushion to protect themselves in case it costs more for them to purchase milk. 
Without a compact, the price farmers get for their milk can vary significantly. These variations in price are passed through to stores by co-ops and other handlers. Yet stores prefer not to constantly change prices for customers so they build in a cushion. But this huge profit margin can be reduced by Compacts which means that Dairy Compacts will save consumers money and provide more income to farmers. 
Unfortunately, the OMB study is based on very limited information from USDA. USDA only gave OMB price information from 6 stores in New England--and only in two cities where it was announced in press accounts, in advance, that retail prices would go up even though store and wholesaler costs had dropped 35 cents per gallon. 
Even in light of this OMB concluded that after 6 months, retail store prices in the compact region of New England were 5 cents lower than the rest of the nation. 
New England newspaper accounts of the implementation of the Compact were very interesting. For example, the July 1, 1997, the Portland Press Herald, Portland, Maine, points out that `Cumberland Farms increased the price of whole milk by four cents but dropped the price of skim by a penny' when the Compact was implemented. 
Also, they note that `At Hannaford's Augusta store, Hood milk--a brand-name product--was selling for $2.63 a gallon, while the Hannaford store brand was selling for $2.32.' 
Also, `Shaw's increased its price by about 20 cents a gallon in [parts of] the five other New England states but kept the price the same here [in Maine].' 
The June 26, 1997, Boston Globe and the June 27, Providence Journal pointed out before the Compact was implemented that one of the chains signaled a price increase. A spokesman for Shaw's Supermarkets, Bernard Rogan, is quoted as saying that milk prices will go up next week 
The June 30, Boston Globe reported that `The region's major supermarkets are raising their milk prices 20 cents a gallon, ignoring arguments that their profit margins are big enough to absorb a new price subsidy for New England dairy farmers that takes effect this week.' 
As OMB discovered, after six months this initial signaled increase, described above, was being subjected to competitive pressures and that consumer prices in New England were on average lower than the rest of the nation. 
Studies of prices charged in stores in Vermont, for example, show that the most important factor in the price of milk is the brand and the store. In cities and towns in Vermont the variation in price among stores was in the 50 cents to one dollar range. In other words, in the same town the price of a gallon of milk varied greatly and still does. 
These store variations, and variations through the use of store coupons, dwarf any possible impact of the compact. 
Also note that reports have indicated that the dairy case is the most profitable part of a supermarket. The product profitability of fluid milk is $16.46 per square foot, whereas regular grocery items return only $2.32 per square foot. This information is from testimony of Professor Andrew Novakovic, on April 10, 1991, before the Committee on Agriculture of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
All other food expenditures dwarf how much income that consumers spend on fluid milk. The savings consumers can achieve through buying `on sale' or house-brand items, or through using discount coupons, far exceed typical changes in the price of fluid milk. Only 3 percent of the average household's total expenditures on food go for fluid milk. This information is from an article called `Food Cost Review,' 1995, from the Economic Research Service of U.S.D.A. 
Note also that OMB reported that the Northeast has the Nation's second highest cost of dairy production ($14.27 per cwt in 1996) and its milk generated the lowest returns per cwt after expenses. OMB found that a smaller proportion of New England farms are competitive than in other regions. Net average returns per cow in Vermont are $350 per year and in Wisconsin are $460 year. OMB determined that the Compact generated about $70 more in annual income per cow. 
So why all the fuss about the compact and who is generating it? 
For one, Kraft, the international milk manufacturing giant, opposes the compact. Kraft's annual U.S. sales exceed $16 billion. They are owned by Phillip Morris, the tobacco giant. 
Perhaps the writer Ben Johnson said it best: `Whilst that for which all virtue now is sold, And almost every vice--almighty gold.' 
IDFA, which receives funding from Kraft which is owned by big tobacco, went on a spending spree. One big staff acquisition was from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. The very person who led Public Voice's press attack on the Compact was negotiating for a job with the milk manufacturers who opposed the Compact. 
Lobbying registration forms show the whole sad story. 
In June 1996, the Senior Vice President for Programs at Public Voice publicly defended his organization from charges that its analysis was influenced by corporate contributions.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I tell my friend from Mississippi, we discussed, last night, what we were trying to do, as he knows. The Senator from Arizona has been most helpful in trying to help this along, to get the antinepotism bill up, but also have the time to do the Fletcher nomination. 
What I understand the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Arizona want to do is to get something locked in so we can take care of both those. 
There were some who wanted a rollcall vote on the nepotism bill. Is the distinguished leader saying it would be easier for his scheduling if there was not one? I came to this conversation late; I apologize.

But we do want a specific time for a vote on the Fletcher nomination, and I rely on the distinguished leader to work this to a time convenient for scheduling. It is, of course, with the understanding that there will be a time set down for a vote on Mr. Fletcher that we would be able to reach an agreement.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Arizona. As he knows, I have opposition to this bill coming forward. I am not in favor of the bill. It will pass, I understand, but I am not in favor of it. 
I know of no problem created by the appointment of judges who are from the same family. Indeed, the three historical example of which I am aware lead me to the opposite conclusion. Justice David Brewer served with his uncle Justice Stephen Field on the United States Supreme Court after being appointed by President Harrison in 1890. Learned and his cousin Augustus Hand served together in the Southern District of New York and on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Richard and Morris Arnold are brothers currently serving on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. All served with distinction. 
I do not know why the country should be deprived of the judgment and wisdom of someone because a relative proceeded him or her to the bench. We have had relatives serve simultaneously in government before and now. Should one of the Levin brothers or Hutchinson brothers not serve in Congress? Should one of the Breyer brothers be barred from the federal bench? For that matter, should federal judges be prohibited who are related to Senators who recommend them to the President and then voted for their confirmation? 
I believe that S. 1892 is an unnecessary and unwise bill. Moreover, it could lead to appointment barriers against daughters and nieces of current judges. With people living longer and women as well as men having been practicing law and entered public service in the last decades, I fear that the prohibition envisioned by the bill will serve as yet another barrier to keep qualified women from being appointed to the bench. This may be an unintentional consequence of the bill, but a likely consequence nonetheless. 
Senator Kyl's bill is intended to do what section 458 of title 28, United States Code, does not; namely, prohibit the appointment to a federal court of a relative of a judge already serving on that court. The bill would amend the law to add a prohibition against the appointment of a person to a federal court on which a first cousin or closer relative of that nominee was an active or senior judge. 
In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson appointed Augustus Hand to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York where he joined his distinguished first cousin and close friend Judge Learned Hand. In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge elevated Judge Augustus Hand to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where he rejoined his cousin Judge Learned Hand, who had been elevated three years before. Had the Kyl bill been in force, neither of these appointments would have been in accordance with law. 
The service of the Hand cousins on the Second Circuit was central to the development of the law in our Circuit and to its reputation as the finest federal appellate court in the country. 
More recently, just six years ago in 1992, President George Bush appointed Judge Morris Arnold to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where he joined his brother Judge Richard Arnold on that court. In our confirmation proceedings, a number of Senators commented favorably on the fact that Judge Arnold was joining his distinguished brother. 
When it was a brother being nominated by a Republican President, the familial relationship was seen as a plus, a benefit for the public. Now that we have a Democratic President nominating a son to join a bench that has included his mother, a new danger of possible appearance of conflict of interest is being conjured up as an excuse to delay and oppose confirmation of a distinguished scholar and decent person. 
I worry that we are raising something that we don't need to raise. I realize this affects Professor Fletcher's appointment. But I think we may have legislated beyond where we need to legislate. 
There are problems with the appointment of judges to the federal judiciary, but nepotism in the appointment of judges does not appear to be one of them. After all, it is the President who nominates and the Senate that consents. If we really wanted to do something about the evils of nepotism, we would prohibit Presidents from nominating their relatives or the Senate from confirming theirs. Other judges, relatives or not, do not have a role in the appointment process. 
The bigger problem with respect to the judiciary is the assault on the judiciary by the Republican majority and its unwillingness to work to fill longstanding vacancies with the qualified people being nominated by the President. Professor Fletcher's nomination has been a casualty of the Republican majority's efforts. Forty-one months and two confirmation hearings have not been enough time and examination to bring the Fletcher nomination to a vote. 
Professor Fletcher is a fine person and an outstanding nominee has had to endure years of delay and demagoguery as some choose to play politics with our independent judiciary. The Ninth Circuit continues to function with multiple vacancies among its authorized judgeships, although we have five nominees to the Ninth Circuit pending before the Senate for periods ranging from four to 41 months. Two await hearings, one awaits a Committee vote, and two have been on the Senate calendar awaiting final action for many months. 
This is too reminiscent of the government shutdown only a couple of years ago and the numerous times of late when the Republican congressional leadership has recessed without completing work on emergency supplemental and disaster relief legislation, on the federal budget, campaign finance reform, comprehensive tobacco legislation, the patient bill of rights and HMO reform. 
In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned that vacancies would harm the administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly declared: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' 
Once this bill is acted upon by the Senate, the Senate will finally be allowed to turn its attention to the longstanding nomination of Professor Fletcher. I have said from the outset of Senator Kyl's effort that I would not hold up consideration of his bill but that I wanted an opportunity to note my opposition to it and to vote against it. Indeed, it was Senator Kyl who held his bill over for a week before it was considered before the Judiciary Committee. 
Despite the Committee reporting of the bill on May 21, 1998, the majority did not propose consideration of S. 1892 until Monday of this week, October 5, 1998. I responded without delay that I was prepared, as I had been all along, to enter into a short time agreement to be followed by a vote on the bill. Consistent with that undertaking I have noted my opposition and am prepared to vote. 
Madam President, I am willing to yield the remainder of the time and go to a vote.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, five years ago, Mr. Irving Gross of Londonderry, Vermont returned to his father's birthplace, Skierniewice, Poland for the first time. During his trip he visited the city's Jewish cemetery. Like many other Jewish cemeteries in Poland, Skierniewice's had been destroyed by the Nazis and ravaged by time. The grounds were unkempt and monuments and headstones were broken, overturned or missing completely. 
Today, through the efforts of Mr. Gross, Mr. Tadeusz Zwierzchowski, a former member of the Polish underground and a Skierniewice resident, and local Skierniewice authorities, the cemetery has been rehabilitated. It now stands as a memorial to the Polish Jews who perished under Nazi persecution and serves as a powerful reminder to the residents of Skierniewice of the vibrant Jewish culture that once enriched their city and their lives. 
Mr. President, I would like to recognize all those who participated in this important effort to commemorate the role of the Jewish people in Polish culture and their plight during the Holocaust. In bearing witness to the past, the residents of Skierniewice have made a valuable contribution to their city's future.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is delayed in a committee of conference, but I understand that he has no objection to this side beginning on this nomination. I also notify colleagues that if we reach a point where neither side has further members wishing to speak on the nomination, it is going to be the intention of the managers to yield back whatever time we have. I mention that so that people understand that it is possible that this rollcall may occur sooner than 20 minutes from now. 
Mr. President, at long last, this day has finally arrived. Senate confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor has been stalled for 7 long months without any explanation or justification. I have spoken on behalf of this outstanding nominee more than a dozen times. In fact, the most recent time was Monday of this week. I hope that now those who have had the secret hold on this nomination will come forth and claim `credit' for preventing this qualified nominee from helping end the emergency that has confronted the Second Circuit since March. Throughout all the time that there have been secret holds that have kept her nomination from going forward, she has been denied her rightful seniority on the court as others have gone forward. It has not been the Senate's finest hour. 
I recall the glowing statement of support from Senator Moynihan to the Judiciary Committee at her hearing back in September 1997, a year ago. I appreciate, as well, the strong statement Senator Moynihan made to the Senate on behalf of this outstanding nominee this summer when her nomination was being stalled. I very much appreciate the efforts he has made on behalf of this outstanding nominee. He has been persistent in his support and in seeking to bring this nomination to the floor without delay. As members of the minority party, that has been a very, very difficult task. 
Along with a number of Senators, I wrote to the majority leader on April 9, 1998, urging `prompt and favorable action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor.' We noted then the judicial emergency that had to be declared by Chief Judge Winter of the Second Circuit. 
Since March 23, he has had to cancel hearings and proceed with three-judge appellate panels that contain only one Second Circuit judge. That crisis is continuing. 
What is happening is when they have these three-judge panels, only one of the judges is from the Second Circuit. They have to bring judges from elsewhere, or retired judges to hear cases. 
Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination has taken over 15 months in spite of the emergency that plagues the Second Circuit. 
We have seen the strong support for this nominee from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and from the Puerto Rican Bar Association, the Hispanic National Bar Association, and many other bar associations around the country. We have received literally thousands of letters of support for this nominee. 
Late this summer, a column in the Wall Street Journal noted that Judge Sotomayor was being held up on the Republican side of the aisle because of speculation that she might one day be considered by President Clinton for nomination to the United States Supreme Court. This was confirmed by a report in the New York Times on June 14. 
As I said earlier, this has not been the Senate's finest hour. 
How disturbing and how shameful: trying to disqualify an outstanding Hispanic woman judge by an anonymous hold. Here is a highly-qualified Hispanic woman judge who should have been confirmed to help end the crisis in the Second Circuit more than seven months ago. 
How petty, how mean, how wrong to cost this judge the seniority she should have had on the Second Circuit by someone anonymously holding her up on the other side of the aisle. 
I note very clearly for the Record that every time the question of her nomination came forth, it has been made clear that every single Democrat said they were prepared to go forward with her nomination. Every single Democrat said they would vote for her. 
When she is confirmed as I fully expect she will be, she will be only the second woman and second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit. Judge Sotomayor is a source of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women everywhere. 
Judge Sotomayor is a highly qualified nominee who was confirmed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She rose from a housing project in the Bronx to attend Princeton University and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the New York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. 
She has been a fine District Court Judge. It was Judge Sotomayor who issued a key decision in 1995 that brought an end to the work stoppage in major league baseball. She applies the law. In this, as in her other decisions, Judge Sotomayor followed the law. That is what judges are supposed to do. There is no basis for a charge that she is or will be a judicial activist. 
In his annual report on the judiciary this year on new Year's Day, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.* * * `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.' 
Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees in the 104th and 105th Congresses, the Senate is shirking its duty. When those nominees are women or members of racial or ethnic minorities, this is especially disturbing. 
Today, after holding this nomination for seven months on the Senate calendar, the Senate will finally get a chance to vote on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. I look forward to our taking action to confirm this outstanding nominee. 
Mr. President, obviously I am not going to put this in the Record. But I would just note that this two-foot stack of papers contains some of the letters from distinguished lawyers and distinguished bar associations from all over this country--from prosecutors and defense attorneys alike; from people who do appellate work and those who do not; from every spectrum of the bar. These are all letters from people who support the nomination of Judge Sotomayor. These are people who can now finally get a response, a response indicating that this superb candidate is finally being considered by the Senate, that the anonymous holds are no longer being allowed to restrain her nomination, and that the Senate finally walked out into the daylight to vote. I have every confidence that vote will be a favorable one and that she will finally be confirmed--even though she was unjustly denied the seniority she would have gotten had the confirmation gone forward on schedule. 
Mr. President, I understand there is no one else seeking to speak on either side. And I have been told by the Republican side that I have permission to yield back their time. I yield their time. I yield our time. We are prepared to vote.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased with the Chairman in offering this important legislation, the Improvements to International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998, to combat international crime. 
Crime and terrorism increasingly have an international face. The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are just the most recent reminders of how vulnerable we are to terrorist attacks. In a shockingly brutal attack, more than 250 men, women and children, were murdered in cold blood. Among those 250 victims were 12 of our fellow citizens. And none of us can forget that it was only a short time ago that there was another assault right here at home, in the Capitol itself. 
With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with ease. They can transfer funds with a push of a button, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans here and abroad. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with it. 
This bill does exactly that, not with sweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by law enforcement. The bill offers tools and protection to investigators and prosecutors, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international criminals and terrorists now enjoy. 
I initially introduced some of the provisions of this bill as early as April 30, 1998, in the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs Act in Prisons of 1998 with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein, and Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden many of these provisions set forth in the bill on behalf of the Administration in S. 2303, the International Crime Control Act of 1998. I again included almost all of the provisions in another major anti-crime bill, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998, on September 16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, and Torricelli. 
It is a particular pleasure now to be able to draw from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete, very important improvements that can enjoy bipartisan support, and which I hope and trust can be enacted into law, even in the short time remaining in this session. All of these provisions enjoy the full support of the Administration, and each of them is a law enforcement priority. 
The bill would criminalize murder and other serious crimes committed by organized crime against U.S. nationals abroad, and against state and local officials who are working abroad with federal authorities on joint projects or operations. 
The bill also protects our maritime borders by providing realistic sanctions for vessels that fail to `heave to' or otherwise obstruct the Coast Guard. No longer will drug-runners be able to stall or resist Coast Guard commands with impunity. 
The bill also increases our authority to exclude from entry into our country international criminals and terrorists, including those engaged in flight to avoid prosecution, alien smuggling, or arms or drug trafficking under specific circumstances. At the same time, we ensure that the Attorney General has full authority to make exceptions for humanitarian and similar reasons. 
The bill includes important money laundering provisions. At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on anti-terrorism, FBI Director Louis Freeh noted the importance of money laundering laws as a tool in stopping not only international drug kingpins, but also international terrorists, such as Usama bin Laden, the multi-millionaire terrorist who has been linked to the recent embassy bombings. 
The bill has two important provisions aimed at computer crimes: it provides expanded wiretap authority, subject to court order, to cover computer crimes, and also gives us extraterritorial jurisdiction over access device fraud, such as stealing telephone credit card numbers, where the victim of the fraud is within the U.S. 
We cannot do it all alone, however. This bill facilitates international cooperation by allowing our country to share the proceeds of joint forfeiture operations, to encourage participation by those countries. It streamlines procedures for executing MLAT requests that apply to multiple judicial districts. Furthermore, the bill addresses the essential but often overlooked role of state and local law enforcement in combating international crime, and authorizes reimbursement of state and local authorities for their cooperation in international crime cases. The bill helps our prosecutors in international crime cases by facilitating the admission of foreign records in U.S. courts. Finally, the bill would speed the wheels of justice by prohibiting international criminals from being credited with any time they serve abroad while they fight extradition to face charges in our country. 
These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. They are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I must close with a special thanks to my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. It has been pleasure to work closely with him to craft a bipartisan bill that will accomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure place.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 2, 1998, in a statement I made on the Senate floor, I attributed the creation of the Dodge Development Center and Veterans Assistance Office in Rutland, Vermont to Chapter One of the Vietnam Veterans Association, also located in Rutland. I need to clarify for the record that, although some of the early members of VVA Chapter One were part of the very early stages of the idea, VVA, Chapter One was not responsible for the development, founding, or creation of the center. 
Years of hard work went into organizing community involvement, volunteer labor and donations, fundraising, remodeling, and furnishing that has resulted in the establishment of the only homeless shelter just for veterans in Vermont--the Dodge Development Center. I want to congratulate the people primarily responsible for this accomplishment. They are: Robert Rummel, Paul Albro, Cynthia Turrell-Burns, Peggy Gibbud, Jeff Hatch, Clark Howland, Gene Miner, Tom Neary, Lance Warner, and Tim Beebe. There were also dozens of volunteers and community members who helped them make this dream come true. 
I thank them for their persistence. They have worked through many funding and permitting hurdles over the years. On Veteran's Day this year, they will dedicate the center and open the doors of the shelter to homeless veterans. Again, I want to congratulate them and thank them for their determination.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate considers possible amendments to the Vacancies Act, we have occasion to focus on the Senate's advice and consent role for all presidential nominations and the American people have an opportunity to review how well, or how badly, this Senate has fulfilled that constitutionally-mandated role. 
It is important to explore ways to help the Executive Branch improve the process by which the President nominates, the Senate confirms and then the President appoints people to serve in important positions within the executive and judicial branches of our federal government. Indeed, I have often joined with Senator Byrd to defend the authority of the Senate on this issue and to protect the Senate's role against the executive encroachments by way of excessive use of the recess appointment power. 
I recall when the Reagan and Bush administrations were abusing the power of recess appointment and note, by contrast, how sparingly President Clinton has used that constitutional authority. I am advised that while President Reagan made 239 recess appointments in 8 years and President Bush made 78 recess appointments in 4 years, President Clinton has used his recess appointment power only 45 times over the last 5 years. 
I also recall how President Clinton acted with great restraint last year when he and the Attorney General joined to appoint Bill Lann Lee the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights rather than using his power to make that a recess appointment. 
Let us focus on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. He was initially nominated to head the Civil Rights Division in July 1997. At the end of 1997, that nomination got caught up in one of the narrow, partisan-driven whirlwinds that hit Washington every now and then. The result was that the nomination became a victim of the anti-affirmative action lobby and was denied a vote by the full Senate. Bill Lee was mischaracterized last fall as a wild-eyed radical and as someone ready to impose an extreme agenda on the United States. He was misportrayed as a supporter of quotas. The Republican majority demonized this fine man and killed his nomination by denying him a Senate vote. 
After looking at Bill Lee's record, I knew he was a man who could effectively lead the Civil Rights Division, enforce the law and resolve disputes. I reviewed his record of achievement and saw a practical, problem solver and noted last year that no one who has taken the time to review his record could call him an idealogue. I recognized that Bill Lee would be reasonable and practical in his approach to the job, and that he would be a top-notch enforcer of the Nation's civil rights laws. 
Bill Lann Lee has been serving for almost 10 months now as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and he has established a solid track record. He is doing an outstanding job for all Americans. I have had a chance to take a close look at what he has been doing while serving as the acting head of the Civil Rights Division. What I find is a record of strong accomplishments. I see professionalism and effective problem solving. I find him enforcing the law in a sensible and fair manner. 
Accordingly, I urge the Senate finally to consider the nomination of Bill Lann Lee and to confirm him to this important post. The President renominated Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division on January 29 of this year. Given his outstanding performance over the past 10 months, I urge the Senate to show him the fairness of a vote on his nomination. I am confident that when Senators consider his nomination and review his record, a majority of the United States Senate will vote to confirm this outstanding nominee. 
It is to raise this matter to the attention of the American people and for action by the Senate, that I have filed an amendment to the Vacancies Reform Act bill to provide for a vote on the longstanding nomination of Bill Lann Lee before the Senate ends this year's session. 
As we consider how to improve the Vacancies Act, the Senate would do well to consider its lack of action on the many outstanding nominations that the President has sent to us over the past several years on which the Senate has taken no vote. In addition to unprecedented delays in the consideration of judicial nominations--46 judicial nominations are pending and 22 are on the Senate calendar--there have been a number of executive branch nominations who have been denied consideration and a vote for many, many months. 
Bill Lann Lee is an example. He was first nominated for the important position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights on July 21, 1997, over 14 months ago. When no Senate vote was taken on his nomination last year, he was renominated on January 29, 1998. For the past 8 months his nomination has, again, been bottled up in committee. 
This is an historic nomination. Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian-American to head the Civil Rights Division. He deserves to be confirmed by the Senate and to be accorded the full measure of recognition for all that he has achieved and all that he is doing on behalf of all Americans. 
The Senate was denied the opportunity to vote on that nomination before adjournment in 1997. With one notable and courageous exception, the Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee would not report the nomination to the Senate so that the Senate could vote whether to confirm this outstanding nominee. Although the Republicans have a majority in the Senate, they have been unable to pass legislative proposals to undermine the nation's commitment to equal opportunity and civil rights. As a result, the Republican majority decided to stall the Lee nomination without a vote as a trophy to its extremist factions. This nomination could not be defeated in a fair up or down vote, so they determined to avoid that Senate vote altogether and at all costs. 
I understand that Senator Durbin, a thoughtful member of both the Senate Government Affairs Committee, from which this bill emerged, and the Senate Judiciary Committee, which refused to report the Lee nomination to the Senate for action, has filed a series of amendments to the Vacancies Reform Act to begin to deal with this aspect of the problem--Senate inaction on nominations. I will study those proposals with great interest. 
I was disappointed this year that the Senate Judiciary Committee repeatedly postponed and eventually canceled hearings regarding the performance of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department under the leadership of Bill Lann Lee. I was disappointed because such a hearing would have offered us a chance to look at the outstanding on-the-job performance of our Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
Over the past 10 months, the Division has focused most intensely on three areas of the law: violations of our Nation's fair housing laws, enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (`ADA'), and cases involving hate crimes. Bill Lee and his team of civil rights attorneys have made advances in each of these areas of the law. 
The Division has resolved a number of housing discrimination cases over the past few months, including the following: An agreement was reached with two large New Jersey apartment complexes resolving allegations that the defendants had discriminated against potential renters based on family status and race. 
A housing discrimination case in Michigan was settled involving an apartment manager who told black applicants that no apartments were available at the same time that he was showing vacant apartments to white applicants. An agreement was also reached with the second largest real estate company in Alabama, which had been steering applicants to agents and residential areas based on race. 
The Civil Rights Division has also focused on educating the public about the ADA and enforcing it where necessary. These cases have included: resolution of a case in Hawaii to allow those who are vision impaired to travel to the State without having to quarantine their guide dogs for four months in advance of arrival; 
a consent decree with the National Collegiate Athletic Association so that high school athletes with learning disabilities have the opportunity to compete for scholarships and participate in college athletics; an agreement with private hospitals in Connecticut to ensure patients who are deaf have access to sign-language interpreters; and assistance to the State of Florida to update their building code to bring it into compliance with the ADA. Florida joins Maine, Texas and Washington State in having a certified building code thereby ensuring better compliance with the ADA by architects, builders and contractors within the State. 
The Civil Rights Division has also resolved several hate crimes cases over the past 7 months, including:  
In Idaho, six men pleaded guilty to engaging in a series of racially motivated attacks on Mexican American men, women and children, some as young as 9; in Arizona, three members of a skinhead group pleaded guilty to burning a cross in the front yard of an African American woman; and in Texas, a man pleaded guilty to entering a Jewish temple and firing several gun shots while shouting anti-Semitic slurs. 
The Division has also been vigorously enforcing its criminal statutes, including: indictments against three people in Arkansas charged with church burning; guilty pleas by 16 Puerto Rico correctional officers who beat 22 inmates and then tried to cover it up; cases arising from Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14, being lured to the U.S. and then being forced into prostitution; and guilty pleas from 18 defendants who forced 60 deaf Mexican nationals to sell trinkets on the streets of New York. Out of concerns about slavery continuing in the U.S., Bill Lann Lee has created a Worker Exploitation Task Force to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Department of Labor. I commend the Acting Assistant Attorney General for putting the spotlight on these shameful crimes. 
Other significant cases which the Civil Rights Division has handled in the past few months include the following: several long-standing school desegregation cases were settled or their consent decrees were terminated, including cases in Kansas City, Kansas; San Juan County, Utah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Japanese-Latin Americans who were deported and interned in the United States during World War II finally received compensation this year. Lawsuits in Ohio and Washington, D.C. were settled to allow women access to women's health clinics. 
The record establishes that Bill Lann Lee has been running the Division the way it should be run. Here in Washington, where we have lots of show horses, Bill Lee is a work horse--a dedicated public official who is working hard to help solve our Nation's problems. I commend him and the many hardworking professionals at the Civil Rights Division. 
Bill Lee has served as acting head of the Civil Rights Division for 10 months now. Given the claims made by many in the Senate last fall that Mr. Lee would lead the Division astray, you might expect that he would be in the headlines every day associated with some extreme decision. Instead, we have seen the strong and steady work of the Division--solid achievements and effective law enforcement. 
A few weeks ago, I received a letter from Governor Zell Miller of Georgia that is emblematic of the record that Bill Lee has established. Governor Miller discusses Bill Lee's efficient and effective ability to settle an action which involved Georgia's juvenile detention facilities. He notes that he was not exactly a fan of the Civil Rights Division before Bill Lee came along and writes that he `was fearful that Georgia would be unable to get a fair forum in which to present our position, and that we would once again be compelled to engage in protracted and expensive litigation.' Governor Miller writes that his fears were unfounded, that the parties engaged in `intensive and expeditious negotiations' and reached a fair agreement. Governor Miller also notes: 
I have indicated to Mr. Lee both personally and publicly that he and his staff treated Georgia with professionalism, fairness, and respect during our negotiations. Under the direction of Bill Lann Lee, what began as a potentially divisive and litigious process was transformed into an atmosphere where the State was able to have its case heard fairly, resulting in a reasonable agreement benefiting all parties. This is the way in which the Civil Rights Division should operate in its dealings with the states, and I am pleased to commend Mr. Lee and his staff for their efforts in this matter. 
The Acting Assistant Attorney General continues to build on his reputation as a professional and effective negotiator, who routinely earns praise from opposing parties. I had high expectations for Bill Lann Lee when he was nominated and I have not been disappointed. He is doing a terrific job. It is time for the Senate to end his second-class status and confirm him. 
We need Bill Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times. It is wrong for the Senate to ignore his nomination any longer and a shameful slight to him, to his family and to all who care about fairness and equal rights. 
I remember vividly when Mr. Lee appeared at his confirmation hearing almost one year ago. He testified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He understood that as the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division his client is the United States and all of its people. He told us poignantly about why he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all when he spoke of the treatment that his parents received as immigrants. 
Mr. Lee told us how in spite of his father's personal treatment and experiences, William Lee remained a fierce American patriot, volunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II and never lost his belief in America. He inspired his son and Bill now inspires his own children and countless others across the land. Mr. Lee noted: 
My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society. 
Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father and mother taught him. I continue to work to end the ugliness of Senate inaction on his nomination. If opponents want to distort his achievements and mischaracterize his beliefs, let them at least have the decency to engage in that debate on the floor of the Senate so that this longstanding nomination can be acted upon--either vote it up or vote it down, but vote on it. His career of good works and current efforts should not be rewarded with continued ugliness. Such treatment drives good people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate. I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the nation. In this case, I am afraid that the Senate has shown no conscience. 
Bill Lann Lee is a man of integrity, of honesty and of fairness. Born in Harlem, to Chinese immigrant parents, he has lived the American dream and stayed faithful to American values. He has done nothing to justify the unfair treatment by the Senate. 
As a child he worked in his parents' laundry after school. He went on to graduate magna cum laude from Yale College and to obtain a law degree from Columbia University. Bill Lann Lee has spent his life helping others--helping them to keep their jobs, to keep their homes, to have a chance at a well-earned promotion and to raise healthy children. 
As western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a public interest law firm founded by Thurgood Marshall in 1939, Mr. Lee litigated hundreds of cases ranging from employment discrimination claims to efforts to ensure probation offices are widely dispersed throughout Los Angeles to ensuring that poor children are tested for lead poisoning. His extensive experience and renowned skill at settling cases has served him well as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. 
Most impressive is the array of former opposing counsels and parties who support Mr. Lee's nomination. In addition to Governor Miller, consider the words of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan: Our `negotiations could not have concluded successfully without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise.' I believe Mayor Riordan's enthusiastic support and assurance that Mr. Lee has `practiced mainstream civil rights law' should carry some weight. 
Mr. Lee is a top quality candidate. He has all the essential qualities for this job--a legal career devoted to top-notch civil rights work, an outstanding degree of integrity and a commitment to practical solutions. This year he also has a proven track record as the Acting Assistant Attorney General. 
No one can argue that the President has sent to us a person not qualified by experience to lead the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee's record of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor and when he said to this Committee that quotas are illegal and wrong and that he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about his resolve to do what is right. The Senate should vote on this outstanding nominee. He is the right person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. We need his proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times. 
Unfortunately, last year's consideration of this outstanding nominee took a decidedly partisan turn when the Speaker of the House chose to intervene in this matter and urge the Senate Republican Leader to kill this nomination. In his unfortunate letter, Speaker Gingrich unfairly criticized Mr. Lee and accused him of unethical conduct. The allegations of wrongdoing carelessly lodged against Mr. Lee are contradicted by the Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, as well as the Vice-President of the Los Angeles Police Commission, T. Warren Jackson, the Assistant City Attorney, Robert Cramer, and the City Attorney, James K. Hahn, but the damage had been done. 
I recall when times were different. I recall when charges were raised against Clarence Thomas and the Judiciary Committee held several days of additional hearings after that nomination had already been reported by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. There was a tie vote in Committee on the Thomas nomination, which would not have even been reported to the Senate had we not also voted virtually unanimously, with six Democrats joining seven Republicans, to report the Thomas nomination to the floor without recommendation. Of course, ultimately the nomination of Judge Thomas to become Justice Thomas was confirmed by the Senate. 
It remains my hope that the Senate will now give Bill Lann Lee the same fairness that we showed Clarence Thomas and allow his nomination to be voted upon by the United States Senate. It would be ironic if, after the Senate proceeded to debate and vote on the Thomas nomination--one that included charges that he engaged in sexual harassment--the Republican leadership prevented the Senate from considering a nominee because he has worked to remedy sexual harassment and gender discrimination. 
After consultation with Senators, the President acted after Congress's adjournment last fall to name Bill Lann Lee the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The President then followed through on his commitments and renominated this distinguished civil rights attorney and public servant on January 29, 1998. This Senate is now approaching adjournment, again, and, again, the Senate is not voting whether to confirm or reject this nomination. The President has fulfilled his end of the bargain and acted with restraint and respect in this regard. The Senate has done nothing with respect to this nomination but ignore it. So, when we criticize this President for not sending up nominees fast enough, let us not forget that the Senate has now had ample opportunity for over two years to act on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee and the Senate has not. 
Last year, I was honored to stand on the steps to the Lincoln Memorial, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke 35 years ago and inspired the nation toward the promise of equality. I heard our colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein speak about the continuing struggle to provide equal opportunity to all Americans. I took inspiration from the wisdom of Rep. John Lewis whose compass is ever true on these matters. We heard Rep. Maxine Waters declare in no uncertain terms the support of the Congressional Black Caucus for Bill Lann Lee, Representative Patsy Mink take pride in reiterating the support of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus and Representative Xavier Becerra add the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 
I heard Justin Dart, a dedicated public servant who worked with President's Reagan and Bush, declare that people with disabilities support Bill Lann Lee and Representative Bob Matsui recount the dark days before the civil rights laws when his family had to suffer the indignity of internment because of the Japanese ancestry. 
Just last week when Congress presented Nelson Mandela with the Congressional Gold Medal, we drew upon the American tradition of Lincoln, King and so many who labored long and sacrificed much in the struggle toward equality for all Americans. We honored that past last week. We could extend it today by taking up and voting upon the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. I call upon the party of Lincoln to be fair to Lee and vote on this nomination. 
Let the Senate debate and vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe he will be confirmed and will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will subside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each child--girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, regardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual orientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to live the American dream.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I alert my colleagues that I will speak a very short time. I am going to talk about a UC that I would have proposed but will not propose today but will explain why. 
Earlier this month, the Republican majority came to the floor, unfortunately without prior warning, to propound a unanimous consent request for consideration of the Hatch-Sessions juvenile justice bill, S. 10. I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama here on the floor now. The UC was proposed late on Thursday afternoon. Unfortunately, it was after Senators had been informed there would be no more votes. In fact, I had already left for home in Vermont. We were unaware that they might want to proceed to S. 10 on Thursday. 
My concern is that there had been a year of inaction on the bill. I had tried to propose some additional changes to the bill, which was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997, but I was unable to get any response from the other side of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee on that. There was also no attempt to get a response from this side of the aisle on the proposed UC. 
I mention this because the failure of this Congress to take up and pass responsible juvenile crime legislation does not rest with the Democrats. And it is not going to be cured by any kind of a procedural floor gimmick. 
Over the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at hearings on several occasions about my concerns with the legislation. At the same time, I have expressed my willingness to work with the chairman of the full committee in a bipartisan manner to improve the juvenile crime bill. 
I am not alone in my criticisms and in wanting to see changes in the bill. It has been criticized by virtually every major newspaper in the United States. It has been criticized by national leaders ranging from Chief Justice Rehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund. The National District Attorneys Association, and other law enforcement agencies have also written me with their concerns about this bill. 
I have also heard from numerous State and local officials across the United States, including the National Governors' Association, the Council of State Governments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. All of them have expressed concerns about the restrictions this bill would place on their ability to combat and prevent juvenile crime effectively. 
In short, S. 10, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, is a bill laden with problems--in fact, so many that at last count the bill had lost nearly a quarter of the Republicans who signed on as cosponsors since its introduction. 
The unanimous consent request that was proposed by the other side of the aisle, I believe, was patently unfair. It would have limited debate of juvenile justice and other crime matters. It would have permitted the Republicans to offer a substitute to their own bill but not allowed Democrats the same opportunity. The only additional amendments in order under their plan would be five on each side. 
We just received from the chairman of the Judiciary Committee the day before yesterday, September 23, the latest version of S. 10 which contains over 100 different changes, but the Republicans want to limit us to 5 amendments. That is not a bipartisan effort to improve this bill. 
While I appreciate that we are short of time in this Congress, and I understand why the Republican leadership would like to limit the number of amendments the Democrats may offer, of course, the decision to bring the bill up at the end of the Congress is that of the majority. I have no problem with that. 
But we have worked diligently to pare down the amendments that the Democrats plan to offer to S. 10 from 64 to the 25 substantive amendments which I would have put in a proposed UC. Keep in mind what I said, also, that just a couple days ago we were handed the latest version from the other side with over 100 changes. We are talking about cutting Democratic amendments from 64 to 25 substantive ones that address the substantial criticisms leveled at this bill. I want to assure that Senate consideration of this legislation is fair, full, and productive. I do not appreciate, frankly, what appears to be almost a procedural ambush to move this bill forward in a way that allows consideration of all changes from the other side but very few from this side.

Mr. LEAHY. No, no. I tell my friend from Alabama, this is what I would propose. I already stated that. And I have informed the floor staff on the Republican side that I would not make the unanimous consent request to this proposal at this time. Anyone who has known me for 24 years here knows I would never do this. I would not propose a unanimous consent request on a day when everybody has taken off already to the various airports or home. But I am putting into the Record, so that Senators can read it on Monday, what would have been my proposal if we were able to make it. I would not seek to ambush the other side. I have not done that in 24 years, and I am not about to start now.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about the responsibility of Congress considering the referral from Kenneth Starr. 
I am deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. This process is fast losing credibility. It is enough off track that the national interest, which should be our paramount concern, is suffering. It is enough off track that our institutions of government--the Congress, the Presidency, and the Constitution itself--may suffer damage that will linger long after we are all gone from the scene. The way we handle this responsibility, the character of our own institution is also at stake. 
America, look where we are. The President has misused his office. Kenneth Starr is leaving in his wake a body of debris that will bring down the entire independent counsel law. And now that this matter is on our doorstep, we in the Congress increasingly risk, through our actions, undermining the public's faith and trust in our own institution of our own national government. 
In these early stages of this inquiry into the actions of the President of the United States, it is time we ask whether we, ourselves, are on the verge of becoming not part of the solution but, instead, part of the problem, by harming our national interests and further eroding the public's confidence in their government. 
Should we be disappointed and offended and angered by the President's conduct? Certainly we should be. As a father, a husband, as an American, and as someone who knows this President and supports the good he has done for the Nation, I am appalled and saddened by this episode. 
These are difficult days in Washington and they are difficult days for the Nation. But this is a time when the Congress must rise above partisanship and look beyond short-term political objectives. We must consider what best serves the common good of the American people. 
Four tenets must guide Congress' proper handling of the referral from Mr. Starr: We should put the national interests first in all of our considerations. Secondly, proceedings should be structured and enjoined to be as bipartisan as possible. Third, we must be fair. And fourth, we must move toward resolving this controversy as promptly as possible. 
Early statements by the House leadership point in the right direction, but these have been overtaken by events and actions. I have noted on many other occasions my respect for Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and John Conyers, ranking Democratic member of that committee. These two distinguished leaders have the wisdom and experience to work together for the good of the country and to construct a fair, bipartisan process. It does not augur well for such a process, however, that unilateral decisions and party-line votes already have become the norm, and the House has paid little attention to ensuring fairness in its initial decisions and actions. 
The past several weeks have not been reassuring. The other body has yet to determine what rules and procedures should govern their actions, how our traditional notions of due process and fundamental fairness will be guaranteed, and how to prevent this process from degenerating into a partisan exercise. The House only now is beginning to examine the precedence and bipartisan actions of the House Judiciary Committee that considered the impeachment of President Nixon. In effect, they have put the cart before the horse. 
Perhaps the meeting yesterday involving the House leadership will yield some progress. It is time for leaders in the House and the Senate, leaders from both parties, people of good will who put the national interests first, to reconsider how this matter is being handled and where it is headed. 
A partisan train seems to be rolling out of the House station in a decidedly political direction. Perhaps it is too much to hope that Members, in the midst of reelection efforts, would view this matter through any prism other than their own campaigns or prospects for majority control in the Congress and the presidential election in 2000. The public is wondering whether this Congress can do anything serious now that election season is upon us. 
Congress risks undermining the public's trust in our institutions of our national government. We must consider what best serves the common good of the American people and our national interests. This is a time when Congress must rise above partisanship and look beyond short-term political objectives. 
Like Dwight Eisenhower before him, my friend and former colleague Senator Dole used his Farewell Address to the Senate in 1996 to warn of an impending danger to the Nation. He chose to speak about a fundamental lesson he learned in his years in Washington: that people of both parties must work together. He reminded Senators that we represent all our constituents--Republicans, Democrats, and independents. 
On any consideration of proceedings to inquire into the possible impeachment of the President of the United States, as on matters of such overriding significance as the declaration of war or amending the Constitution, all Members of Congress must be mindful of the Nation's interests and the potential for harm that can be caused by pursuing narrow partisan goals. 
We have already seen personal criticism of the President while he was overseas on a trip to Russia and Ireland. On Monday, the videotape of the President's appearance before one of the Starr grand juries was broadcast over the airwaves, even while the President of the United States was making a major address before the United Nations on international terrorism--one of the greatest current threats to our Nation's security and to stability around the world. These rash acts harm the Nation and they harm the international standing of the United States. Such actions may help the political fortunes of some in Congress, but they ignore the precedent of past Congresses where criticisms of the President were put on hold during those periods when he represents the United States in issues with other countries. 
The national interest would not be served by a divided House membership proceeding to punt this matter to the Senate while they crossed their fingers and hoped for the Senate to bail them out of an ill-considered finding. The national interest should not be hostage to months of meandering through an undefined partisan process that leads inexorably to impasse. A lengthy, partisan impeachment inquest would serve no national purpose but only lead to a year of balkanized polarization that would poison a generation of relationships across the aisle in Congress and even across the Nation. 
A fundamental lesson I learned as a practicing lawyer and that was reinforced when I served as the State's Attorney for Chittenden County, in my work as a U.S. Senator, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and now as its ranking member, is that fairness in a process is critical to the result of that process. The process must be fair for the American people to find it credible. If it is not fair, the American people will not find it credible. 
One measure of a prosecutor's fairness is fulfilling the duty to disclose exculpatory evidence. That aspect of fairness has constitutional implication in criminal matters. Now, weeks after the allegations have saturated the public media, we find buried in the thousands of pages of documents, transcripts and appendices that Ms. Lewinsky, the principal witness upon whom Mr. Starr relies for his charges, volunteered at the conclusion of her testimony before the grand jury that `no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.' Neither Mr. Starr, nor the lawyers working for him, felt any duty of fairness to ask this critical question. It was left to an anonymous juror who felt an obligation to the real issue at the heart of this matter. 
One measure of the credibility of the House's proceedings will be whether it achieves the balance and fairness that so far has been lacking in the work of Mr. Starr's office. 
An independent counsel does not have the checks and the accountability that enforce judgment and discretion in other prosecutors in this country. Wielding that enormous authority, therefore, it is incumbent upon an independent counsel to discipline himself with discretion and judgment. Unfortunately, in this matter, it is by this juncture quite clear that the report from Mr. Starr is an advocate's brief, intended to persuade, rather than the balanced presentation that should be the hallmark of such a somber exercise. 
And, again, this makes it all the more important that the House exercise independent judgment and provide the balance and fairness that is lacking from the work of a zealous band of prosecutors. 
I am concerned that the same House that is charged with this awesome responsibility is the body that is being asked to hold the Attorney General of the United States in contempt for having sought to protect the investigative process in connection with the ongoing campaign finance investigation. 
I participated in a lengthy meeting with Senator Hatch, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Burton, Mr. Waxman, and the Attorney General on this matter on September 2. The Attorney General extensively consulted with us in a sincere effort to allow congressional oversight without compromising the ongoing investigation. In spite of the efforts she made to satisfy any legitimate congressional oversight interest, and despite the lack of any basis to charge contemptuous conduct, the House persists in its efforts to pressure and sanction. 
This effort and the lack of balance it signals do not bode well for the House's other tasks. 
I recall, as well, that it was not too many months ago in this same Congress that Republican leaders in the House were urging that impeachment be used as a device to intimidate federal judges when they rendered decisions that a Republican Member did not like. Impeachment should not be used as a partisan, ideological bludgeon in any context. That is not the proper use of this important constitutional authority. Such comments, at a minimum, complicate the task at hand. 
Nor is it reassuring to read accounts of meetings, on the other side of the aisle, in this body, where partisan litmus tests on this matter are being applied to those chairing committees in the Senate. 
There are few matters of such possible significance that may come before Congress as the matter of a President's fitness to serve. 
The people of the United States elected William Jefferson Clinton to the Presidency in 1992 and reelected him in 1996. He and the Vice President are the only people serving anywhere in the Nation in any office who were elected by the entire country. 
Under our Constitution, the Senate is charged with the ultimate responsibility to act as the jury in connection with any charges that the House were to deem worthy of impeachment. 
Never in our history as a country has the Senate convicted a President of an impeachable offense. Only in the tumultuous times following the Civil War has the Senate been through the ordeal of a Presidential impeachment trial. 
Mr. President, I am honored to have been elected by the people of Vermont to serve as their United States Senator. In our history, only 20 other Vermonters have had the privilege to hold the seat I now have representing our State. I am proud to serve as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I appreciate my limited role in the Senate and in our government. I cannot take lightly being asked to judge whether a President, elected by the people of the United States, ought to be removed from office by an act of the Congress of the United States. 
Now, the search for blame is a practiced congressional skill. It always bears fruit--sometimes bitter fruit. But the acceptance of our own solemn responsibility is more difficult. We must discharge our duties by serving the national interest, not by appealing to partisan or even public passions. 
Let our actions not compound the Nation's anguish, harm the common good, nor further shake the public's faith in our institutions of self-government. These institutions have served this country well for over 200 years, in accordance with our Constitution, which has been a guidepost for that time. Our Constitution has survived because good men and women have stood up when needed to make sure it survives. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield back the remainder of my time.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to continue my strong objections to proposed Federal Communications Commission rules that could rob states and communities of the authority to decide where unsightly telecommunications towers should be built. 
I am one of five Senators who voted against the Telecommunications Act of 1996. One of my fears was that the will and voice of states and local communities would be muzzled if that bill became law. Unfortunately, with the passage and implementation of the Telecommunications Act, my fears have been confirmed. 
Mayors and citizens in Vermont towns and in towns across this nation are outraged that they have little control over the construction of these towers. This is especially troubling when communications technology is advancing so rapidly that large towers may become obsolete. 
For example, some wireless phone providers offer the older analog wireless service. That is now being replaced by digital phone service in many parts of the nation. Analog providers could provide towerless service to towns by using an array of small antennas, instead of a large tower. Phone companies prefer to build one large tower with its switching equipment because that is cheaper than the switching equipment needed to control an array of small antennas. However, if a town does not want its landscape ruined with a tower, I think the company should be required to offer service through these smaller antennas. 
Second, for companies offering the `newer' digital wireless phone service, other technologies are eliminating the need for large towers. The Iridium Corporation will offer phone service throughout the United States in the near future that is based on more than 60 low-earth-orbit satellites. Over time, this will provide a satellite communications link from any place in the world, even where no tower-based system is available. 
In areas of the United States outside the range of cellular coverage the Iridium phone will connect you directly to the Iridium satellite network. Emergency communications--911 and disaster assistance--will be greatly aided with this development. 
Hospitals, ambulances and other emergency service providers will be linked together by satellite directly from a hand held phone. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that this service will cost more than regular cell phone service. However, they also report that other competitors and more efficiencies of scale are likely to bring down costs over time. 
In addition, I have previously discussed how the towerless PCS-Over-Cable technology provides digital cellular phone service by using small antennas rather than large towers. These small antennas can be quickly attached to existing telephone poles, lamp posts or buildings and can provide quality wireless phone service without the use of towers. This technology is cheaper than most tower technology in part because the PCS-Over-Cable wireless provider does not have to purchase land to erect large towers. 
Since there are viable and reasonable alternatives to providing wireless phone service through the use of towers, I think that towns should have some say in this matter. And I think that mayors, town officials and local citizens will agree with me. 
Why should a large tower be forced on a town when wireless phone service can be provided without using a tower? Indeed, many argue that towerless phone service is much better in a disaster situation. During New England's ice storm, I am told that some towers collapsed. Tornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes can destroy large telephone towers. But satellite phone service would not be affected by these disasters. Also, the PCS-Over-Cable technology is much less likely to be out of service for large areas during a disaster as compared to wireless phone service provided by large towers. 
In addition, other advances in communications technology may also make towers obsolete even faster than anticipated. 
This is one reason why I am so concerned about the federal government taking away the power of local communities to control where these towers are located. When big, unsightly towers are proposed to be located in the wrong place, towns should be able to just say no. And if the rules proposed by the FCC are implemented, towns will be further marginalized and even lose their input as to where the towers are placed. 
As I have said before, I do not want Vermont turned into a pincushion, with 200 foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain and in every valley. I have heard from many Vermonters, as well as town leaders and citizens from across the country, who are justifiably afraid that they are losing control over the siting, design, and construction of telecommunications towers and related facilities. They feel that state and local concerns are being sacrificed to the interests of a small part of the telecommunications industry that uses large towers. 
Today I continue in my commitment to the preservation of state and local authority. I am joined by Senators Jeffords, Hutchinson, Moynihan, Feingold, Gregg, Moseley-Braun, Sarbanes, Dodd, and Cleland in introducing legislation which would repeal the authority of the FCC to preempt state and local regulations affecting the placement of new telecommunications towers. This legislation expands and improves upon S. 1350, which I introduced one year ago. 
Vermont communities and the state of Vermont must have a role in deciding where towers are going to go. They must be able to take into account the protection of Vermont's scenic beauty. This is true for other states as well. 
In fact, by requiring the companies to work with Vermont towns, acceptable alternative locations of towers, acceptable co-location of antennas on existing towers, or the use of alternative towerless technology, could be suggested. This would be much better than allowing any company to just come in willy-nilly and plop down towers next to our backyards. 
In my view passage of this bill will actually promote better emergency phone service, better phone service in disasters and the more advanced digital wireless phone service. 
The bill I am introducing today will mandate that states and towns cannot be ignored in the spread of telecommunications towers. This bill will recognize that states and towns do have choices in this cellular age. 
This bill also incorporates the concerns of the aviation industry. The Federal Aviation Administration presently does not have authority to regulate the siting of towers. Airport officials work with local governments in the siting of towers. Silencing local governments will have a direct effect on airline safety, according to the representatives of the airline industry that we have heard from. 
In a comment letter responding to the FCC's proposed rule, the National Association of State Aviation Officials attacked preemption on the grounds that it `is contrary to the most fundamental principles of aviation safety * * * the proposed rule could result in the creation of hazards to aircraft and passengers at airports across the United States, as well as jeopardize safety on the ground.' I cannot think of anyone who would want towers constructed irrespective of the negative and potentially dangerous impacts they may have on airplane flight and landing patterns. 
Make no mistake. I am for progress, but not for ill-considered, so-called progress at the expense of Vermont families, towns and homeowners. Vermont can protect its rural and natural beauty while still providing for the amazing opportunities offered by these technological advances. 
To deprive states of the ability to protect their land from unsightly towers is wrong, and the FCC rules should not stand. My legislation would reaffirm that states have a role to play in where telecommunications towers are placed and providing alternates to wireless providers.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 1301. Senator Durbin and Senator Grassley have worked together to mold a bipartisan bill that seeks to correct abuses in the bankruptcy system while preserving access to it for honest debtors. Every American agrees with the basic principle that debts should be repaid. The vast majority of Americans are able to meet their obligations. But, for those who fall on financial hard times, bankruptcy should be available in a fair and balanced way. 
Unfortunately, more and more Vermonters and more and more Americans are filing for bankruptcy. The numbers are disturbing. While the unemployment rate keeps going down and inflation remains low, the nation's personal bankruptcies keep going up. Thus, this rise in bankruptcy filings has occurred at the same time that we enjoy a robust economy. If fact, Vermont's unemployment rate hit a 10-year low just the other day. Vermont's personal bankruptcy rate increased by about 40 percent for each of the last two years. 
Still, Vermont was ranked next to last among the 50 states in personal bankruptcy filings last year. In most other states, personal bankruptcy rates increased even more dramatically while unemployment rates declined. I do not know all the answers why more and more Americans are filing for bankruptcy. I think some may be abusing the system. I think most are not. My guess is that stagnant wages and more consumer credit card debt are the primary reasons. 
Where there are abuses in the bankruptcy law, we should move to correct them. I believe that this bill does that by establishing standards for bankruptcy judges to consider with respect to Chapter 7 and 13 filings and by discouraging bad-faith repeat filings. This bill also includes better bankruptcy data collection procedures so that we can learn more about the root causes of the recent rise in bankruptcy filings. Accurate data will also allow us to better evaluate the impact of this reform legislation. 
But we must also remember that bankruptcy serves as a safety net for many of our constituents. Those who use bankruptcy are the most vulnerable of the American middle class. They are older Americans who have lost their jobs or are unable to pay their medical debts. They are women attempting to raise their families or secure alimony and child support after a divorce. They are individuals struggling to recover from unemployment. This bankruptcy reform bill protects them. 
As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminate abuses in the system, we need to remember the people who use the system, both the debtor and the creditor. We need to balance the interests of creditors with those of middle class Americans who need the opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial burdens. 
Unfortunately, the House-passed consumer bankruptcy reform bill requires an arbitrary means testing of debtors to be eligible for Chapter 7 filings. Many bankruptcy practitioners and bankruptcy judges predict that the radical means-testing requirements in the House bill would swamp the bankruptcy process with a flood of new litigation over a debtor's filing status. Indeed, the Congressional Budge Office estimates that H.R. 3150 would cost taxpayers up to $16 million a year for new bankruptcy judges and other court administrative expenses. Moreover, CBO estimates that the House bill would impose new private sector mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, of at least $100 million on our economy. We need balanced bankruptcy reform, not more unfunded mandates and costs to taxpayers. 
The House bankruptcy reform bill also fails to adequately protect our most vulnerable citizens--our children. More than one-third of the one million annual bankruptcies involve spouse and child support orders. But the House bill proposes profound changes to the bankruptcy code for spouse and child support obligations by placing them on a equal footing with some consumer debt. As a result, custodial parents and ex-spouses may have to fight in court against the deep pockets of corporate lenders with little chance of success. This is unacceptable for America's children. 
I believe that the Senate version of the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 1301, carefully balances the competing interests of debtors and creditors. The bankruptcy reform bill passed by the House of Representatives, H.R. 3150 is not a balanced piece of legislation. The Administration has promised a veto if the House bill were to be adopted by Congress. 
I have already spoken to the other Senators who will serve on a House-Senate bankruptcy reform conference about holding firm to the Senate bill in conference. If we want to enact balanced bankruptcy reforms into law this year, the Senate bill is that measure. If this Congress wants to enact consumer bankruptcy reforms into law, then the conference report must be along the lines of S. 1301. I am glad to report that a majority of the Republicans who will serve on the conference with Senator Durbin and me agree. I expect that we will strongly support the Senate position and prevail in conference. 
I hope that the Senate will adopt this bipartisan bill that corrects the abuses in the bankruptcy system without unfairly penalizing women and children who depend on child support and alimony, as well as older Americans and small business owners. 
I want to take a moment to commend Senator Durbin for his leadership and for working to reform our bankruptcy system in a fair and balanced manner. Senator Durbin has served as a most effective manager of this important measure. He has been informed and exercised good judgment at every turn. He has met every challenge and maintained the bipartisanship that made this possible. Without his extraordinary efforts, there would be no bankruptcy reform legislation being considered for final passage by the Senate. 
I also commend Senator Grassley. I know that is has not always been easy for him to keep this legislation on course. I know that some in his caucus have criticized his efforts to be fair and to continue to work in a bipartisan fashion. I am glad that he did not succumb to that bad advice. Senator Grassley and I have worked together for many years. We agree on many things and we have disagreed on some. I congratulate him for his outstanding efforts as the principal author, subcommittee chairman and floor manager of this bill. He has done a fine job and created a measure for which he deserves our thanks. In this effort I have tried to be constructive--even foregoing offering an important amendment to this particular bill, at Senator Hatch's request. 
I also want to applaud the work of the staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee principally responsible for this bill: Victoria Bassetti and Anne McCormick with Senator Durbin, and Kolan Davis and John McMickle with Senator Grassley. Each worked hard on this very complex issue and helped craft a fine piece of bipartisan legislation. They were here late into many nights and worked ceaselessly for the public interest. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act. It is a bill that the Senate should pass.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been working diligently along with Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, Harkin, and Lieberman to get this measure considered and passed by the Senate. It an important measure to America's future. 
Along with all the Democratic cosponsors of the bill, I signed on to offering our patent bill as an amendment to this bankruptcy bill. I helped provide an opportunity for this amendment in the unanimous consent agreement accepted by the Senate on Friday September, 11th. It is long past time for the Senate to consider this patent reform legislation. 
Unfortunately, Republican opposition to the bill has prevented Senate consideration for more than a year. This is another example of how secret, anonymous holds on the Republican side are preventing important legislation from being considered by the Senate. I deeply regret that those same Republican objections have now succeeded in preventing our Republican cosponsor, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, from even offering this amendment to the bill in the amendment spot that we had reserved for that purpose. I believe that there is strong support for this measure. I cannot guarantee that all 45 Democratic Senators will vote for it, but I do know that no Democrat has prevented or is now preventing its consideration. 
I want to thank Secretary Daley and the Administration for their unflagging support of effective patent reform. Our patent bill would be good for Vermont, good for American innovators of all sizes, and good for America. Unfortunately, the Republican majority or some secret minority of that Republican majority will not allow patent reform to proceed.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard from scores of Vermonters lately who are steaming mad. They have been told by their home satellite signal providers they are going to lose some of their home network satellite channels just as the new TV season starts. They have every right to be upset, because it is within the ability of Congress to unmuddle the mess that satellite viewers are facing. The public has every reason to expect Congress to get its act together to do that, and to do it quite promptly. 
Under a court order, thousands of viewers, many of them living in my home State of Vermont, are going to be cut off from receiving TV stations. These are TV stations, incidentally, that they are paying to receive. We have 65,000 home satellite dishes in Vermont. The court order directly affects only those subscribers who signed up for service after March 11, 1997, but most subscribers are being warned by the signal providers they are going to soon lose several of the network channels they now receive, several of the network channels they expected to receive, several of the network channels they are paying to receive. 
In a rural State like mine, there are many, many areas where the only way you can receive television is by satellite dish. This huge policy glitch is intruding right now into hundreds of thousands of homes throughout the country. It is a royal mess, and Congress and the FCC need to fix it. 
I introduced a bill in March of this year with Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee so we could try to resolve this issue before it became a major problem. We have tried since then to push Congress to find a solution. But many viewers have lost their signals already. We are trying to get these bills passed in the next couple of weeks to restore service and to keep other households from losing their satellite TV signals, not just in Vermont but in every State in this country. 
I am pleased Senator Hatch and I have worked out arrangements with the chairman of the Commerce Committee and other Senators who have been active on this issue, including Senators DeWine and Kohl, and what we have worked out significantly raises the prospect that Congress can soon pass a bill to prevent the cutoff of thousands of viewers this month and in October. The good news is that we hope and believe that all Senators can support our approach. 
Our legislation would keep signals available to Vermonters and subscribers in other States until the FCC has a chance to address these issues by the end of next February. Our legislation will direct the FCC to address this problem for the future. In fact, our proposal ultimately will mean, as technology advances, that Vermonters will be able to receive satellite TV for all Vermont full-power TV stations, and viewers in other States will be similarly protected. Where this helps all of us is that this effort will eventually promote head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers. 
The goal is to provide satellite TV viewers at home in Vermont with more choices, more channel selections, and at lower rates. The evidence is so clear from our hearings: In the areas of the country where there is full competition between cable providers, rates to customers are considerably lower. The same is going to be true when there is greater effective competition between cable providers and satellite signal providers. Over time, the effort will permit satellite TV providers to offer a full selection of local TV channels to viewers--even those living near Burlington, VT, where local signals are now blocked. 
I live about 25 miles from Burlington. I get 1 1/2 channels. There are three stations, three network stations, in Burlington. But because I am out on the side of a mountain, I get 1 1/2 channels. Under the rules they are talking about, I would not be allowed to get satellite TV to have those same networks. It is ridiculous. It defies reality. But our legislation will cure that. 
Under current law, those families have to get their local TV systems over an antenna. If their situation is like mine, it does not give you a clear picture. These bills we now have before us will remove that legal limitation that prohibits satellite carriers from offering local TV signals to viewers. 
What we want is this: That over time, satellite carriers will have to follow the rules that cable providers have to follow, which means they will have to carry, in our case, all local Vermont TV stations--and the same in other States. In addition, Vermont stations will be available over satellite to many areas in Vermont like my own that today are unserved by satellite or by cable. And the second major improvement offered through our legislation is satellite carriers that offer local Vermont channels in their mix of programs will be able to reach Vermonters throughout our State. 
People who have spent money on satellite dishes do not know how this thing could become as fouled up as it is. Frankly, I do not either. But I do know that we can correct it, and our legislation will. It is time for this Congress to step up to the plate and solve this policy nightmare. It is now at the door of countless homes, not only in Vermont but throughout the country. Constituents should know they should not have to take, `Well, not now,' as an acceptable answer. We have plenty time left in this Congress to correct this. 
I commend Senators Hatch and McCain for the leadership they have shown in solving this problem. I am going to continue working with them and I think we are going to get somewhere. I certainly hope we are going to get somewhere, because I don't want to have to tell my neighbors that the Congress has so much time for so many other things but cannot take some time to fix something that directly affects so many hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in October of 1996, I was privileged to participate in a conference in Ottawa hosted by Canada's Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy. I was there with Tim Rieser of my staff who has done so much work on the issue of banning landmines. We were also accompanied by Bobby Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, a man who was way ahead of most of us in pushing for a ban on antipersonnel landmines. 
The purpose of the conference in 1996 was to chart a strategy culminating in a global treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. The Ottawa process was conceived of by Canada and a number of other governments that were fed up with the failure of previous efforts to seriously deal with the mine problem. 
Over 70 governments and dozens of nongovernmental organizations accepted Minister Axworthy's invitation to Ottawa. At that conference, to the surprise of everyone present--but certainly to my delight--Minister Axworthy took the courageous step of challenging the world's governments to return in a year's time to sign a treaty that would accomplish nothing less than a total ban on antipersonnel landmines. 
It was that bold challenge which enabled the international community to finally move from rhetoric to action. In December 1997, just barely over a year later, 122 governments returned to Ottawa to sign a treaty banning the production, transfer, and use of antipersonnel mines forever. 
During the previous year, the United States had refused to participate in the treaty-drafting process. In fact, some U.S. officials dismissed the Ottawa process as a `sideshow.' They predicted that without U.S. support, the Canadian effort would eventually run out of steam. They predicted that this treaty would never take effect. 
In fact, Mr. President, the opposite happened. A few days ago, Burkina Faso, one of so many African countries whose people have been maimed and killed by landmines, became the 40th state to deposit its papers of ratification with the United Nations, triggering the 6-month period before the treaty formally comes into force. 
What many once dismissed as a naive and far-fetched dream is now a reality. In fact, today the treaty has some 129 signatories, including every NATO country, except the United States and Turkey, and every Western Hemisphere country, except the United States and Cuba. 
Mr. President, this is a historic achievement. It is, I am told, by far the shortest period of time that any humanitarian law or arms control treaty has come into force. It is indicative of the tremendous sense of urgency and determination that has grown around the world to stop the carnage caused by landmines. 
But more than anything, it is a tribute to Minister Axworthy, the Government of Canada, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, landmine survivors, and all the other governments, the U.N. Secretary General, and U.N. agencies like UNICEF and UNDP. It indicates the commitment of people like the late Princess Diana, Queen Noor of Jordan, the former coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, Jody Williams, and so many others who have worked so hard to end this scourge. 
The treaty's significance is in its simplicity. It establishes a new, unambiguous international norm. The 20th century saw large portions of the globe contaminated by landmines. Two days ago, a process was formally set in motion to reverse that legacy in the first years of the next century. It is a gift to the next generation, and generations beyond. 
The treaty is a beginning. There are still many millions of mines buried in the ground waiting to be triggered by an innocent footstep or a curious child. Many of the treaty's signatories were once producers, exporters and users of landmines. They are no longer. The parties to the treaty have also pledged to get rid of the mines in the ground, and the United States, to its credit, and many other governments and organizations are already hard at work at demining. 
I had hoped that the United States would be among the 40 original parties to the treaty. That was not to be, but I have no doubt that the United States will yet sign, and I resolve to work with the administration to reach that goal as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, I have traveled throughout the world and have seen the damage caused by landmines. I have been impressed by the dedication of Tim Rieser in my own office who has given so much of himself to this. My wife is a registered nurse, and she has gone into the hospitals and to the clinics run and funded by the Leahy War Victims Fund. She, too, has seen the damage caused by landmines. 
This is a weapon that is often used against civilians. It is a weapon that stays in the ground long after the peace agreements are signed, the armies have left the field and the soldiers have been disarmed. It is a weapon that waits for its victim to pull the trigger by stepping on it, stumbling on it or brushing up against it. It is a weapon that is no longer needed, certainly not by the United States, the most powerful nation on Earth. 
We have to understand that in the end, whether it is a child in Honduras, a farmer in Mozambique, or an American peacekeeper in Bosnia, we all stand to gain in a world in which landmines are banned and their use is a war crime. 
Mr. President, I have been privileged to do many things in my time as a Member of the U.S. Senate on issues that involve us both domestically and worldwide. It is hard to think of anything that has been more of a privilege than working on the landmine issue. Certainly nothing has made me more proud than authoring the first piece of legislation passed anywhere in the world banning the export of landmines--the export moratorium. 
Today, Mr. President, I compliment those who have gotten us this far. As I told Minister Axworthy when I talked to him on the phone a couple evenings ago, we would not be here if he had not made the brave, bold move that he did in Ottawa in 1996. I still recall the reaction when Lloyd Axworthy launched the treaty effort in the Fall of 1996. He said, `Let us come back in a year with a landmine treaty.' Indeed, they did. Indeed, that is where the world is now. Indeed, we are all better for it. 
Mr. President, I see nobody else seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I could not imagine anybody opposing it. I was delighted to see the distinguished senior Senator from Utah has also adopted the same idea of the Senator from Illinois. I think it is an excellent piece of legislation. 
I suspect it will pass unanimously.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard from scores of Vermonters lately who are steaming mad after being told by their home satellite signal providers that they are about to lose some of their network satellite channels. They have every right to be upset. It is within Congress's ability to un-muddle this mess, and the public has every reason to expect Congress to get its act together to do that, and to do that promptly. 
While the hills and mountains of Vermont are a natural wonder, they can also be barriers to reception of clear TV signals over-the-air with rooftop antennas. At my home in Middlesex, Vermont, we can only get one channel clearly, and lots of ghosts on the other channel we receive. We get so many ghosts on our family set that it looks like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are hitting four homeruns at a time. 
That is why Vermonters have chosen satellite reception: They cannot get a clear picture without it. 
I am gratified tonight that we are finally in a position to announce an understanding that I hope will keep satellite TV viewers from having to lose station signals this year. I am joining with both the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Chairman of the Commerce Committee on two separate bills designed fix these problems. I am certain that most Senators will be pleased with this breakthrough, and I hope we can pass this bill without objection in the Senate. 
Under a court order, thousands of viewers--many of them living in my home state of Vermont--will be cut off from receiving satellite TV stations that they are paying to receive. We have 65,000 home satellite dishes in Vermont. the court order directly affects only those subscribers who signed up for service after March 11, 1997, but most subscribers are being warned nonetheless by their signal providers that they will soon lose several network channels they now receive. 
This huge policy glitch is intruding right now into hundreds of thousands of homes. It is a royal mess, and Congress and the FCC need to fix it. 
I introduced a bill in March of this year with Chairman Hatch so that we could try to resolve this issue before it became a major problem. We have tried in the many months since then to push Congress toward a solution. Many viewers have lost signals already. We are trying to get these bills passed in the next couple of weeks to restore service and to keep other households for losing their satellite TV signals--not just in Vermont but throughout the nation. 
I am pleased that Chairman Hatch and I have worked out arrangements with the Chairman of the Commerce Committee and other Senators active on this issue, including Senators DeWine and Kohl, that significantly raise the prospects that Congress can soon pass a bill to prevent the cutoff of thousands of viewers this month and in October. We hope and we believe that all Senators can support this approach. 
This legislation would keep signals available to Vermonters and subscribers in other states until the FCC has a chance to address these issues by the end of next February. 
Our legislation will direct the FCC to address this problem for the future, and our proposal ultimately will mean--as technology advances--that Vermonters will be able to receive satellite TV for all Vermont full-power TV stations. Viewers in all states would be similarly protected. This effort eventually will promote head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers. 
The goal is to provide satellite home viewers in Vermont and across the nation with more choices and more channel selections, and at lower rates. The evidence is clear that in areas of the country where there is full competition between cable providers, rates to customers are considerably lower. The same will be true when there is greater effective competition between cable providers and satellite signal providers. 
Over time, this effort will permit satellite TV providers to offer a full selection of local TV channels to viewers--even to those living in or near Burlington, Vermont, where local signals are now blocked. 
Under current law, those families must get their local TV signals over an antenna which often does not provide a clear picture. These bills eventually will remove that legal limitation that prohibits satellite carriers from offering local TV signals to viewers. 
Over time, satellite carriers will have to follow the rules that cable providers have to follow which will mean that they must carry all local Vermont TV stations. In addition, Vermont stations will be available over satellite to many areas of Vermont that today are unserved by satellite or by cable. 
Vermonters now receive network satellite signals with programming from stations in other states. In other words, they may get a CBS station from another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate. 
By allowing satellite providers to offer a wider variety of programming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be able to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing with satellite carriers. Cable will continue to be a highly effective competitor with its ability to offer extremely high-speed Internet connections to homes and businesses. 
The second major improvement offered through our legislation is that satellite carriers that offer local Vermont channels in their mix of programming will be able to reach Vermonters throughout our state. The system will be based on regions called Designated Market Areas, or DMAs. Vermont has one large DMA covering most of the state--the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA, and two smaller ones in southeastern Vermont--the Albany-Schenectady-Troy DMA includes Bennington County--and in southwestern Vermont, where the Boston DMA includes Windham County. 
Using current technology, signals would be provided by spot-beam satellites using some 150 regional uplink sites throughout the nation to beam local signals up to two satellites. Those satellites would use 60 or so spotbeams to send those local signals, received from the regional uplinks, back to satellite dish owners. High-definition TV would be offered under this system at a later date. This system is likely to take two to three years to be put into full operation. In the meantime, another company called EchoStar may provide some local-into-local service in some parts of the country. 
Under the bill that Senator Hatch and I introduced in March, this spotbeam technology would mean that home owners with satellite dishes in downtown Burlington, and in every county in Vermont except Windham and Bennington, would receive all the full-power TV stations in the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA, including PBS stations. Bennington residents would receive the stations in the Schnectady-Albany-Troy DMA, and Windham County residents would receive Boston signals, since they are in the Boston DMA. Over time these counties could be blended into the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA. 
Since technology advances so quickly, other systems could be developed before this bill is fully implemented that would provide similar service but using different technology. And existing systems would be accommodated under our legislation, but those systems would follow rules similar to current rules until conversion to this new technology takes place. 
It is time for this Congress to step up to the plate and solve this policy nightmare that is now at the door of countless homes across the nation. Our constituents rightly will not take `not now' as an acceptable answer. 
I commend Chairman Hatch and Chairman McCain for the leadership they have shown in solving this problem, and I look forward to continue working closely with them and with other Senators as we move this solution toward, and eventually across, the goal line.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Administration first announced the encryption policy that has been in effect for the past two years, I warned on October 1, 1996, that: 
The general outline of the Administration's plan smacks of the government trying to control the marketplace for high-tech products. Only those companies that agree to turn over their business plans to the government and show that they are developing key recovery systems, will be rewarded with permission to sell abroad products with DES encryption, which is the global encryption standard. 
The Administration announced yesterday that it is finally fixing this aspect of its encryption policy. New Administration guidelines will permit the export of 56-bit DES encryption without a license, after a one time technical review, to all users outside the seven terrorist countries. No longer will the Administration require businesses to turn over business plans and make promises to build key recoverable products for the freedom to export 56-bit DES. 
In 1996, I also raised serious questions about the Administration's proposal to pull the plug on 56-bit DES exports in two years. I warned at the time that this `sunset' provision `does not promote our high-tech industries overseas.' I specifically asked, 
Does this mean that U.S. companies selling sophisticated computer systems with DES encryption overseas must warn their customers that the supply may end in two years? Customers both here and abroad want stable suppliers, not those jerked around by their government. 
I am pleased that the Administration has also changed this aspect of its policy and adopted an export policy with no `sunset.' Instead, the Administration will conduct a review of its policy in one year to determine how well it is working. 
Indeed, while 56-bit encryption may still serve as the global standard, this will not be the situation for much longer. 128-bit encryption is now the preferred encryption strength. 
In fact, to access online account information from the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal Employees, Members and congressional staff must use 128-bit encryption. If you use weaker encryption, a screen pops up to say `you cannot have access to your account information because your Web browser does not have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128-bit encryption (the strong U.S./Canada-only version).' 
Likewise, the Department of Education has set up a Web site that allows prospective students to apply for student financial aid online. Significantly, the Education Department states that `[t]o achieve maximum protection we recommend you use 128-bit encryption.' 
These are just a couple examples of government agencies or associated organizations directing or urging Americans to use 128-bit encryption. We should assume that people in other countries are getting the same directions and recommendations. Unfortunately, while American companies can fill the demand for this strong encryption here, they will still not be permitted to sell this strength encryption abroad for use by people in other countries. 
Nevertheless, the Administration's new encryption policy announced today moves in the right direction to bolster the competitive edge of our Nation's high-tech companies, allow American companies to protect their confidential and trade secret information and intellectual property in communications with subsidiaries abroad, and promote global electronic commerce. These are objectives I have sought to achieve in encryption legislation that I have introduced and cosponsored with bipartisan support in this and the last Congress. 
I remain concerned, however, that privacy safeguards and standards for law enforcement access to decryption assistance are ignored in the Administration's new policy. These are critical issues that continue to require our attention.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know everyone is concerned about protecting this country's children from those who would prey upon them. Those concerns have intensified in recent years with the growing popularity of the internet and the world wide web. Cyberspace gives users access to a wealth of information; it connects people from around the world. But it also creates new opportunities for sexual predators and child pornographers to ply their trade. The challenge is to protect our children from exploitation in cyberspace while ensuring that the vast democratic forum of the Internet remains an engine for the free exchange of ideas and information. 
The bill that we are introducing today meets this challenge. While it is not a cure-all for the scourge of child pornography, it is a good step toward limiting the ability of cyber-pornographers and predators from harming children. 
This bill differs markedly from H.R. 3494, the child protection and sexual predator bill that the House passed last June. I should note that this bill mirrors a Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute to H.R. 3494, which passed the Judiciary Committee by unanimous consent this afternoon. 
I thank the Chairman for working with me to fix the many problems in H.R. 3494, and to make this bill more focused and measured. Briefly, I would like to highlight and explain some of the differences between the bills. 
As passed by the House, H.R. 3494 would make it a crime, punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment, to do nothing more than `contact' a minor, or even just attempt to `contact' a minor, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. This provision does not appear in the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill. The act of making contact is not very far along the spectrum of an overt criminal act: it is only the expression of a criminal intention without follow through. A simple `hello' in an internet chat room, coupled with bad intentions, would expose the speaker to severe criminal sanctions. Targeting `attempts' to make contact would be even more like prosecuting a thought crime. 
Another new crime created by the House bill prohibited the transmittal of identifying information about any person under 18 for the purpose of encouraging unlawful sexual activity. In its original incarnation, this provision would have had the absurd result of prohibiting a person under the age of consent from e-mailing her own address or telephone number to her boyfriend. We fixed this problem by making it clear that a violation must involve the transmission of someone else's identifying information. In addition, to eliminate any notice problem arising from the variations in state statutory rape laws, we lowered the age of the identified minor from 18 to 16--the federal age of consent. Finally, we clarified that the defendant must know that the person about whom he was transmitting identifying information was, in fact, under 16. This change was particularly important because, in the anonymous world of cyberspace, a person may have no way of knowing the age of the faceless person with whom he is communicating. 
I had many of the same concerns regarding another provision of the House bill, which makes it a crime to transfer obscene material to a minor. Again, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill lowers the age of minority from 18 to 16 and provides that the defendant must know he is dealing with someone so young. I would add that this provision of the bill applies only to `obscene' material, that is, material that enjoys no First Amendment protection whatever--material that is patently offensive to the average adult. The bill does not purport to proscribe the transferral of constitutionally protected material that may, however, be unsuitable for minors. Besides raising serious constitutional concerns, such a provision would also have the unacceptable consequence of reducing the level of discourse over the Internet to what would be suitable for a sandbox. 
The original House bill would also have criminalized certain conduct directed at a person who had been `represented' to be a minor, even if that person was, in fact, an adult. The evident purpose was to make clear that the targets of sting operations are not relieved of criminal liability merely because their intended victim turned out to be an undercover agent and not a child. The new `sting' provisions addressed a problem that simply does not currently exist: no court has ever endorsed an impossibility defense along the lines anticipated by the House bill. The creation of special `sting' provisions in this one area could lend credence to impossibility defenses raised in other sting and undercover situations. At the same time, these provisions would have criminalized conduct that was otherwise lawful: it is not a crime for adults to communicate with each other about sex, even if one of the adults pretends to be a child. Given these significant concerns, the `sting' provisions have been stricken from the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill. 
Another major problem with the House bill is its modification of the child pornography possession laws. Current law requires possession of three or more pornographic images in order for there to be criminal liability. Congress wrote this requirement into the law as a way of protecting against government overreaching. By eliminating this numeric requirement, the House bill puts at risk the unsuspecting Internet user who, by inadvertence or mistake, downloads a single pornographic image of a child. The inevitable result would be to chill the free exchange of information over the web. I was unwilling to accept this possibility; the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill keeps current law in place. 
Unlike H.R. 3494, the bill we are introducing today contains no new mandatory minimum sentences. I oppose the use of mandatory minimums because they take away the discretion of the sentencing judge, which can result in unjust sentences and can also induce defendants who would otherwise have pled guilty, hoping to obtain some measure of leniency from the court, to proceed to trial. 
Another problematic provision of the House bill gives the Attorney General sweeping authority to subpoena records and witnesses in investigations involving crimes against children. We should be extremely wary of further extending the Justice Department's administrative subpoena power. The use of administrative subpoenas gives federal agents the power to compel disclosures without any oversight by a judge, prosecutor, or grand jury, and without any of the grand jury secrecy requirements. That being said, the secrecy requirements may pose a significant obstacle to the full and efficient cooperation of federal/state task forces in their joint efforts to reduce the steadily increasing use of the Internet to perpetrate crimes against children, including crimes involving the distribution of child pornography. 
In addition, it appears that some U.S. Attorneys Offices are reluctant to open a grand jury investigation when the only goal is to identify individuals who have not yet, and may never, commit a federal (as opposed to state or local) offense. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill accommodates all the competing interests by granting the Department a narrowly drawn authority to subpoena only the information that it most needs: routine subscriber account information from Internet service providers. Importantly, subscribers may obtain notice from their service provider. 
The new reporting requirement established by H.R. 3494 is also troubling. Under current law, Internet service providers are generally free to report suspicious communications to law enforcement authorities. Under H.R. 3494, service providers would be required to report such communications when they involve child pornography; failure to do so would be punishable by a substantial fine. 
Of course, we are all committed to eradicating the market for child pornography. Child pornography is inherently harmful to children. Service providers that come across such material should report it, and, in most cases, they already do. We must tread cautiously, however, before we compel private citizens to act as good Samaritans or to assume duties and responsibilities that are better left to law enforcement. 
Working with the service providers, we have refined the House bill in various ways. 
First, we raised the bar for the reporting duty; a service provider has no obligation to make a report unless it has `probable cause' to believe that the child pornography laws are being violated. By setting such a high standard, we intended to discourage service providers from erring on the side of over-reporting every questionable image. This would also overwhelm the FBI and law enforcement agencies. 
Second, we provided that there is no liability for failing to make a report unless the service provider knew both of the existence of child pornography and of the duty to report it (if it rises to the level of probable cause). 
Third, we made clear that we are not imposing a monitoring requirement of any kind: service providers must report child pornography when they come across it or it is brought to their attention, but they remain under no obligation to go out looking for it. 
Fourth, we added privacy protections for any information reported under the bill. 
Fifth, we lowered the maximum fine for first offenders to $50,000; a second or subsequent failure to report, however, may still result in a fine up to $100,000. 
Thus improved, I am confident that the reporting requirement will accomplish its objectives without unduly burdening the service providers or violating the privacy rights of internet users. 
Beyond this, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill strips the House bill of various other extraneous or improvident provisions. Our bill is also free of certain add-ons that appeared in the original version offered by Senator Hatch. In particular, the original version would have opened the floodgates of federal inchoate crime prosecutions by creating a general attempt statute--making it a crime to commit each and every offense in title 18--and by making the penalty for its violation as well as for violation of the general conspiracy statute (which is now capped at 5 years) equal to the penalty for the offense that was the object of the attempt or conspiracy. The Chairman's original bill also created a new rule of criminal procedure requiring defendants to provide notice of their intention to assert an entrapment defense. 
I think there are good reasons why these ideas have been rejected in the past, both by the Congress and by the Federal Judicial Conference, and why they are opposed by business and civil liberties groups alike. At the very least, we should not usher in such radical changes to the federal criminal law without more careful consideration, after proper hearings. 
In conclusion, I commend Senators Hatch and DeWine for their efforts to address the terrible problem of child predators and pornographers. I am glad that we were able to join forces to construct a bill that goes a long way towards achieving our common goals.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is a great date in the history not only of the United States, but of all free people, and of all people who would be free. On September 17, 1787, a small group of truly remarkable Americans gathered to sign one of the greatest documents in all of human history, the Constitution of the United States. 
George Washington signed it as the President of the Constitutional Convention and deputy from Virginia. The names of other signers are familiar to all Americans: Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. Other names should be more familiar than they are, names like Morris and Pinkney and Dickinson and Rutledge. 
We owe them a great debt. They have given us a firm foundation on which has been built our great and abiding stability. Even when this Nation was torn by a terrible fight over the institution of slavery, the Constitution allowed us to recover with amazing speed, become one Nation again, and avoid the generations of smoldering conflict that afflict so many other countries. 
Our Constitution is at once solid and flexible. It can and has been amended from time to time to improve the machinery of government and to expand the rights that citizens enjoy. Throughout our history we have sought to follow Madison's wise advice to limit amendments to `certain great and extraordinary occasions.' 
In Federalist No. 43, James Madison wrote that the Constitution establishes a balanced system for amendment, guarding `equally against that extreme facility, which would render the Constitution too mutable, and that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered faults.' The Constitution is profoundly conservative, in the best sense of that word. As Madison expressed in Federalist No. 49: 
[A]s every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in government, frequent appeals would, in great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on everything and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not possess the requisite stability. 
It is remarkable that although some 11,000 constitutional amendments have been offered in our history, and more than 100 in the 105th Congress alone, the elected representatives in Congress and in the States have adopted only 17 since the original Bill of Rights. We have rejected many amendments that seemed to be good ideas at the time, but which on further reflection proved to be unnecessary. We have found that we could achieve the same results by statute, or have on sober reflection recognized that the amendments would have been mere symbolic gestures. We have avoided turning the Constitution into a mere bulletin board on which we `send a message.' We have respected it and, most importantly, we have resisted the temptation to limit the fundamental freedoms of Americans. We have rejected the temptation to erode the Bill of Rights. 
I cannot ignore the fact that Congress and the States did succumb once to what looked like a good idea without carefully considering the consequences of their action. The eighteenth amendment imposed prohibition and conjured up a swarm of gangsters, bootlegging, and wholesale disobedience of the law. It was a bad idea that had to be undone by another constitutional amendment. We should regard the eighteenth amendment as a reminder that we should go slow, and stop and consider carefully all of the implications of any change before we put it in the Constitution. 
I submit that the Constitution of the United States is a good document--not a sacred text--but as good a law as has been written. That is why it has survived as the supreme law of the land with so few alterations throughout the last 200 years. 
It has contributed to our success as a Nation by binding us together, rather than tearing us apart. It contains the Great Compromise that allowed small States and large States to join together in a spirit of mutual accommodation and respect. It embodies the protections that make real the pronouncements in our historic Declaration of Independence and give meaning to our inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
The Constitution requires due process and guarantees equal protection of the law. It protects our freedom of thought and expression, our freedom to worship or not as we each choose, and our political freedoms, as well. It is the basis for our fundamental right of privacy and for limiting government's intrusions and burdens in our lives. 
I oppose what I perceive to be a growing fascination with laying waste to our Constitution and the protections that have served us well for over 200 years. The First Amendment, separation of powers and power of the purse should be supported and defended. 
When we embarked in this Congress, we each swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That is our duty to those who forged this great document, our responsibility to those who sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution, our commitment to our constituents and our legacy to those who will succeed us. 
The Framers gave us a remarkable document, an extraordinary system of government and protections for our individual liberties. So I celebrate this day, not with the parades or fireworks of the Fourth of July, but with solemn consideration of how the Framers guaranteed our freedom through checks on government power. Most of all, I mark this day with a renewed commitment to cherish and to protect this most precious of legacies, to resist easy amendments, to resist assaults on our Bill of Rights, and to preserve the Constitution for our children and grandchildren.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering S. 2193, the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act (TLT Act), along with some important technical amendments. I wish that Congress was doing more work on intellectual property issues to maintain America's preeminence in the realm of technology. Specifically I wish we were at conference on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which would implement the World Intellectual Property Organization treaties. We should also be passing the Patent Bill, which would help America's inventors of today and tomorrow. I am glad however, at the very least, that we are at last considering the TLT Act.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join baseball fans everywhere in congratulating Mark McGwire of the Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of the Cubs on already breaking the single season home run record this year. I hope that the House will soon pass the bill that we named for another extraordinary man, who once wore number 21 for the Cardinals. Coincidentally, Curt Flood wore number 21, which is Sosa's uniform number, and played for the Cardinals, which is the team for which McGwire now plays. The Curt Flood Act, to end what is left of baseball's antitrust exemption has passed the Senate and is awaiting action by the House. Baseball's resurgence is being fueled by the outstanding efforts of a number of players should be aided by enactment of our legislation. 
I came to the Senate floor in early July to note the possibility that the single-season record for home runs might be broken this year. I noted that at this year's All-Star break, Mark McGwire had 37 homers, Ken Griffey, Jr. 35 and Sammy Sosa 33, as they headed toward Roger Maris' record 61. I urged the Senate to find inspiration in the outstanding seasons that these and other players and teams were having and to improve the Senate's effort in meeting its responsibilities with respect to judicial vacancies. 
I went on to compare the Senate's pace in confirming much-needed federal judges to Mark McGwire's home run pace. It is time for an update. Today, McGwire's season total stands at 63. Over the weekend Sammy Sosa thrilled Chicago and baseball fans everywhere by passing the marks set by Babe Ruth and Roger Maris and totaling 62. Ken Griffey, Jr., now leads the American League with 52 homers, making this first season in major league baseball history in which three players have hit as many as 50 home runs. 
Unfortunately, the Senate confirmation total is stalled at 39. As recently as 1994, the last year in which the Senate majority was Democratic, the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the Republican Senate three years to reach the century mark for judicial confirmations--to accomplish what we did in one session. As Chief Justice Rehnquist correctly observed in his year-end report last year: `The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.' 
The Senate has not even kept up with normal attrition over the past two years, let alone made a real difference in filling longstanding judicial vacancies. Both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have had to cancel hearings due to judicial vacancies. Chief Judge Winter of the Second Circuit has had to declare a circuit emergency and to proceed with only one circuit judge on their 3-judge panels. Recently, he has had to extend that certification of emergency. 
Yet in spite of that emergency, the Senate continues to stall the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. Her nomination has been stalled on the Senate calendar for over six months. Chief Judge Winter's most recent annual report noted that the Circuit now has the greatest backlog it has ever had, due to the multiple vacancies that have plagued that court. 
For a time Judge Sotomayor's nomination was being delayed because some feared that she might be considered as a possible replacement for Justice Stevens, should he choose to resign from the Supreme Court. Perhaps now that the Supreme Court term has ended and Justice Stevens has not resigned, the Senate will proceed to consider her nomination to the Second Circuit on its merits and confirm her without additional, unnecessary delay. 
When confirmed she will be only the second woman and second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit. Just as Sammy Sosa is a source of great pride to the Dominican Republic and to Latin players and fans everywhere, Judge Sotomayor is a source of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women everywhere. 
Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton University and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the New York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is strongly support by Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato. 
Ironically, it was Judge Sotomayor who issued a key decision in 1995 that brought an end to the work stoppage in major league baseball. If only the breaking of the single season home run record could signal the end of the work stoppage in the Senate with respect to her nomination. 
Instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial vacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continued and unexplained and anonymous `holds' become regular order. 
I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain the pace it achieved in the last nine weeks of the last session when 27 judges were confirmed. Instead, the Senate has confirmed only 39 judicial nominees in 24 weeks in session. Had the Senate merely maintained the pace that it set at the end of last year, the Senate would have confirmed 72 judges--not 39 judges--by now. 
Last week The Washington Post included an editorial critical of the Senate for holding nominees without a vote on the Senate calendar. It was right to do so. We have 12 qualified nominees on the Senate calendar awaiting action. Including those still pending before the Committee, we have a total of 45 
judicial nominations awaiting action, some of whom were first received over three years ago. 
The Senate continues to tolerate upwards of 74 vacancies in the federal courts with more on the horizon--almost one in 10 judgeships remains unfilled and, from the looks of things, will remain unfilled into the future. The Judiciary Committee needs to do a better job and the Senate needs to proceed more promptly to consider nominees reported to it. 
Unfortunately, the only record that the Senate is on pace to set this year with respect to judicial nominations is the record for the amount of time it takes to be confirmed once the nomination is received by the Senate. For those few nominees lucky enough to be confirmed as federal judges the average number of days for the Senate confirmation process has continued to escalate. In 1994 and 1995 judicial nominees took on average 86 or 87 days from nomination to confirmation. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 days on average. 
Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. 
Unfortunately, the time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. The average time from nomination to confirmation for judges confirmed this year is 259 days. That is three times the time it took before this partisan slowdown began in earnest. 
I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil this constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. 
The federal judiciary's workload was at least 60 percent lower than it is today when the Reagan-Bush administrations took office. The federal court's criminal docket alone is up from 28,921 cases in 1980 to 50,363 last year. That is an increase of over 70 percent in the criminal case filings in the federal courts. 
During the Reagan and Bush administrations, Democratic and Republican Senates promptly considered and confirmed judges and authorized 167 new judgeships in response to the increasing workload of the federal judiciary. While authorized judgeships have increased in number by 25 percent since 1980, the workload of the federal courts has grown by over 60 percent during the same period. That is why the prolonged vacancies being perpetuated by delays in the confirmation process are creating such strains within the federal courts. 
Unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed to newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies crisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to consider nominees to longstanding vacancies. 
In the early and mid-1980's, vacancies were between 25 and 34 at the beginning of each session of Congress. By the fall of 1983, the vacancies for the entire federal judiciary had been reduced to only 16. 
With attrition and the 85 new judgeships created in 1984, vacancies reached 123 at the beginning of President Reagan's second term, but those vacancies were reduced to only 33 within two years, by the fall of 1986. A Democratic Senate in 1987 and 1988 reduced the vacancies still further to only 23 at the end of the 100th Congress. 
It was not until additional judgeships were created in 1990 that the next significant increase in vacancies occurred and then, again, the Democratic Senate responsibly set about the task of helping fill those vacancies with qualified nominees. Although President Bush was notoriously slow to nominate, the Democratic Senate confirmed 124 nominees in President Bush's last two years and cut the vacancies in half. 
With respect to the question of vacancies, it is also important to note that in 1997 the Judiciary Conference of the United States requested an additional 53 judgeships be created and the Republican Congress has refused to consider that workload justified request. My bill to meet that request, S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, has received no attention since I introduced it over a year ago. Had those additional judgeships been created, as they were in 1984 and 1990 under Republican Presidents, current judicial vacancies would number 127 and total almost 14 percent of the federal judiciary. 
No one should take comfort from the number of confirmations achieved so far this year. It is only in comparison to the dismal achievements of the last two years that 39 confirmations could be seen as an improvement. The President has been doing a better job of sending the Senate scores of nominees more promptly. Unfortunately, qualified and capable nominees are still being delayed too long and stalled without action. 
In commending Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and the others major league players who have inspired the nation with their achievements, I pledge to continue to work for comparable achievements by the Senate in connection with judicial confirmations.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to prevent additional introductions of invasive pests. Last fall, the Northeastern states were startled by reports of an Asian longhorned beetle infestation in Brooklyn and Amityville, New York. This summer, we heard of additional infestations in Chicago and the beetle has been found in wood packing material in South Carolina, California, New Jersey and Texas. Although the beetle has been found primarily in port cities, the shipment of wood packing materials across state lines could lead to the spread of this insect into forested areas across the country. 
This beetle is a serious pest of hardwood trees in its native environment in China, where it has few natural enemies. Here, it has none. If this pest becomes established in our forests, it could turn into the gypsy moth of the 21st century. And, as we learned from the spread of the gypsy month along the East Coast, repeated introductions of the Asian Long-Horned Beetle and its spread could have a staggering economic and ecological impact on our forests. 
It also seems that the beetle has a sweet tooth--attacking mostly Norway and sugar maples. As Vermont and the Northeast begin the leaf peeping season this fall, the threat of an Asian longhorned beetle invasion has us all checking our trees for possible signs of the pest. Not only is the sugar maple the source of our world famous Vermont maple syrup, but it is also what turns our treasured Green Mountains brilliant yellow, orange and red each year. It is what attracts so many visitors to our state this time of year. The wood is also highly prized for furniture, paneling and wood flooring. 
Without immediate attention, spread of this insect into forested areas of New York, Vermont and Massachusetts could threaten the important maple sugar and fall foliage industries of the Northeast. These things can chew trees into sawdust. The last thing I want to see in my backyard is one of these bark-eating, sap-sucking intruders from Asia. 
What is even more alarming is that we do not yet have a way to treat this pest. The only way to get rid of it is by destroying all the infested trees. The best way to fight this pest, and similar non-native wood borers, is to make sure they do not get into our country in the first place. That is why I am introducing legislation today to prevent additional introductions of the beetle and other invasive pests into the United States. 
The `Invasive Pest Control Act' will stiffen the requirements for treatment of imports that use solid wood products and wood packing material like pallets and crates. It will require that these imports either be debarked, kiln-dried or fumigated, depending on size, before they enter the United States. After five years, the use of these packing materials will be prohibited. This will give importers plenty of time to find alternative materials to ship their products. It will also give us a long-term insurance policy against future pest introductions. 
I want to make clear that the Asian longhorned beetle is only one of many invasive pests that present a serious threat to our forests. Spruce bark beetle and Mediterranean pine engraver beetle are two other invasive pests that we should be concerned about. My legislation will help prevent all of these stowaways from sneaking into our ports and then into our forests. 
This legislation is only a first step in preventing future introductions of these pests. We also need to increase funding for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to increase the number of inspectors at our ports and improve shipping information on imports to track the source of these pests. We also need to launch a public awareness campaign to help detect any infestations within our country. In Vermont, we have beetle-identification cards to help the public spot the beetle in their backyards or sugarbushes. We need to do this in all the high-risk areas. 
All of these steps will help protect our forests and forest economies from the Asian longhorned beetle and other pests that could wreak havoc if they get their antennas in the door.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, joined by Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Murray, and other Democratic Senators, I am introducing comprehensive crime legislation, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998, to keep the crime rate in this country going down. Past Democratic anti-crime initiatives, such as the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, have resulted in an historic decrease in crime rates in the United States. The FBI reports that violent crime in 1996 was at the lowest level since 1989, and that the overall crime rate was lower than any year since 1984. Preliminary figures for 1997 show that serious crime dropped an additional four percent last year. These are very good numbers. 
Yet, according to recent reports in the Los Angeles Times, people still feel that crime is the number one public policy issue that needs attention. Americans still feel vulnerable to becoming crime victims, and want policy makers to do more. Thus, even with the decrease in crime rates, this is not the time to stop working on additional ways to reduce crime. Senate Democrats want to do more. We must do more to ensure that the crime rates continue their downward trend next year, the year after, and the years after that. 
The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 builds on the successful programs we have implemented in the 1994 Crime Law and addresses emerging crime problems. The bill is comprehensive. It is realistic. It is fully funded, without reaching into any cookie jars. It is designed to be enacted, without partisan or ideological controversy. In fact, the bill contains a number of initiatives that enjoy bipartisan support. We have tried to avoid the easy rhetoric about crime that some have to offer in this crucial area of public policy. Here is a chance to actually make a difference. It is a `Can Do' Act. 
The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act targets violent crime in our schools, reforms the juvenile justice system, combats gang violence, cracks down on the sale and use of illegal drugs, enhances the rights of crime victims, and provides meaningful assistance to law enforcement officers in the battle against street crime, international crime and terrorism. The Act represents an important next step in the continuing effort by Senate Democrats to enact tough, common-sense and balanced reforms to our criminal justice system. That is why the International Brotherhood of Police Officers has endorsed this bill. 
The bill has ten comprehensive titles to address crime in our schools, crime on our streets, and crime on our borders and abroad. I should note that the bill contains no new death penalties and no new or increased mandatory minimums. We can be tough without imposing the death penalty, and we can ensure certain punishment without removing all discretion from the judge at sentencing. 
Title I of the bill deals with proposals for combating violence in schools and punishing juvenile crime. This title has four subtitles dealing with assistance to schools, reform of the federal juvenile system, assisting States on prosecuting and punishing juvenile offenders and reducing juvenile crime, and protecting children from violence, including violence from the misuse of guns. 
Assistance to Schools. Americans are dismayed and grief-stricken at the recent shootings at schools across the country. While homicides at American schools have remained relatively constant in recent years, the number of students who have experienced a violent crime in school increased 23 percent in 1995 compared to 1989. We need to make sure our children attend school in a safe environment that fosters learning, not fear. 
The bill would provide COPS grants for school-based partnerships between schools and law enforcement to combat school-related crime. It contains a proposal developed by Senator Bingaman to establish a School Security Technology Center using expertise from the Sandia National Labs, and provide grants from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program enabling schools to access technical assistance for school security. 
Federal Prosecution of Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders. The bill would also make important reforms to the federal juvenile system, without federalizing run-of-the-mill juvenile offenses and ignoring the traditional prerogative of the States to handle the bulk of juvenile crime. One of the significant flaws in the Republican juvenile crime bill, S. 10, is that it would--in the words of Chief Justice Rhenquist --`eviscerate this traditional deference to state prosecutions, thereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal judiciary.' The Chief Justice has raised concerns about `federalizing' certain juvenile crimes and has urged that `federal prosecutions should be limited to those offenses that cannot and should not be prosecuted in the state courts.' The Democratic proposals for reform of the Federal juvenile justice system heed this sound advice and respect our Federal system. 
Among other reforms, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act would allow federal prosecution of juveniles when the Attorney General certifies that the State cannot or will not exercise jurisdiction, or when the juvenile is alleged to have committed a violent, drug or firearm offense. 
Prosecutors would be given sole, nonreviewable authority to prosecute as adults 16 and 17 year olds who are alleged to have committed the most serious violent and drug offenses. Limited judicial review is provided for prosecutors' decisions to try as adults 13, 14 and 15 year old juveniles, and 16 and 17 year olds, who are charged with less serious federal offenses. These juveniles are permitted under strict time limits to ask a judge for a `reverse waiver' and transfer to juvenile, rather than adult, status. 
Assistance to States for Prosecuting and Punishing Juvenile Offenders, and Reducing Juvenile Crime. The bill would authorize grants to the States for incarcerating violent and chronic juvenile offenders (with each qualifying State getting at least one percent of available money), providing graduated sanctions, reimbursing States for the cost of incarcerating juvenile alien offenders, and a pilot program to replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies. 
Protecting Children from Violence. The bill contains important initiatives to protect children from violence, including violence resulting from the misuse of guns. Given the recent tragic shootings committed by children, Americans want concrete proposals to reduce the risk of such incidents recurring. At the same time, I certainly do not want to demonize guns or the legitimate use of guns for protection and security or for sport. 
The bill would impose a prospective gun ban for juveniles convicted or adjudicated delinquent for violent crimes. It would require revocation of a firearms dealer's license for failing to have secure gun storage or safety devices available for sale with firearms. The bill would enhance the penalty for possessing a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence or drug offense and for violation of certain firearm laws involving juveniles. In addition, the bill would authorize competitive grant programs for establishment of juvenile gun courts and youth violence courts. 
Title II of the bill addresses the problem of gang violence. We all share a concern about the growing gang problem in our cities and in rural areas of this country. More than 665,000 gang members belong to 23,000 youth gangs in the United States, and the numbers are growing. 
This part of the bill would crack down on gangs by making the interstate `franchising' of street gangs a crime. It will also increase penalties for crimes during which the convicted felon wears protective body armor or uses `laser-sighting' devices to commit the crime. The bill also doubles the criminal penalties for using or threatening physical violence against witnesses and contains other provisions designed to facilitate the use and protection of witnesses to help prosecute gangs and other violent criminals. For example, the bill would clarify that the federal gratuity statute does not apply to cooperation agreements, contrary to the Tenth Circuit's recent Singleton decision. The Act also provides funding for law enforcement agencies in communities designated by the Attorney General as areas with a high level of interstate gang activity. 
Title III of the bill would set forth a number of initiatives in nine subtitles to combat violence in the streets. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act continues successful initiatives in the 1994 Crime Act by putting more police officers on our streets, providing for the construction of more prisons, preventing juvenile felons from buying handguns, and increasing the security of women and children against domestic violence. Specifically, the bill would extend COPS funding into 2001 and 2002; increase the state minimum for Violent Offender Incarceration grants from .25 to .75 percent, establish a state minimum of .75 percent for Truth-in-Sentencing grants, and extend both these grant programs into 2001 and 2002; extend authorization for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funding and local law enforcement grant programs. 
A significant problem that arose this year was the loss of confidentiality that had previously attached to the important work of the U.S. Secret Service. The Departments of Justice and Treasury and even a former Republican President advise that the safety of future Presidents may be jeopardized by forcing U.S. Secret Service agents to breach the confidentiality they need to do their job by testifying before a grand jury. I trust the Secret Service on this issue; they are the experts with the mission of protecting the lives of the President and other high-level elected officials and visiting dignitaries. I also have confidence in the judgment of former President Bush, who has written, `I feel very strongly that [Secret Service] agents should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have seen or heard.' 
The Safe Schools Act provides a reasonable and limited protective function privilege so that in the future Secret Service agents are able to maintain the confidentiality they say they need to protect the lives of the President, Vice President and visiting heads of state. This title of the bill includes a number of provisions to address the following matters: 
Domestic violence: In addition to extending authorized funding for VAWA, the bill would punish attempts to commit interstate domestic violence, expand the interstate domestic violence offense to cover intimidation, and punish interstate travel with the intent to kill a spouse. 
Protecting Law Enforcement and Judiciary: The Act recognizes that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day. According to the FBI, over 1,000 officers have been killed in the line of duty since 1980. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act contains provisions to protect the lives of our law enforcement officers by extending the Bulletproof Vest Partnership grant program through 2003. It also establishes new crimes and increases penalties for killing federal officers and persons working with federal officers, including in the prison context, and for retaliation against federal officials by threatening or injuring their family members. The Act enhances the penalty for assaults and threats against Federal judges and other federal officials engaged in their official duties. 
Cargo/Property Theft: The bill also contains an important initiative proposed by Senator Lautenberg to deter cargo thefts. 
Sentencing Improvements: This subtitle doubles the maximum penalty for manslaughter from 10 to 20 years, consistent with the Sentencing Commission's recommendation, applies the sentencing guidelines to all pertinent federal statutes (such as criminal prohibitions in statutes outside titles 18 and 21 of the United States Code), and other improvements. 
Civil Liberties: The bill includes the `Hate Crimes Prevention Act,' which was originally introduced by Senator Kennedy and has the strong bipartisan support of over twenty Members, and other initiatives designed to bolster support for enforcement of civil rights. 
These program initiatives are funded by extending the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for two more years--from downsizing the Federal Government and not from touching the projected Federal budget surplus. 
Title IV of the bill outlines a number of prevention programs that are critical to reducing juvenile crime. These programs include grants to youth organizations and `Say No to Drugs' Community Centers, reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, Anti-Drug Abuse Programs and Local Delinquency Prevention Programs. Additional sections include a program suggested by Senator Bingaman to establish a competitive grant program to reduce truancy, with priority given to efforts to replicate successful programs. 
The bill would also reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) similarly to H.R. 1818, which passed the House by an overwhelming majority last year. This section creates a new juvenile justice block grant program and retains the four core protections for youth in detention, while adopting greater flexibility for rural areas and modifies the membership of the state advisory groups. 
The Republican juvenile crime bill, S. 10, would gut these core protections for juveniles 
in detention. Republican sponsors of this bill have scrambled to change this bill since they refused to fix it during Committee mark-up, but even as revised this bill remains seriously flawed. A letter sent just last week from the National Collaboration For Youth (comprised of the American Red Cross, Big Brothers, Big Sisters, Boy and Girl Scouts of America, United Way, the YMCA and the YWCA, and other prominent voluntary health and social welfare organizations), criticized the revised S. 10 for being `ill-conceived' and for exposing youngsters `to increased risk.' According to these experts who work intensively with children, S. 10 as revised `could ironically lead to more juvenile crime--not less--if enacted.' The Democratic crime bill puts ideology aside, and follows the advice of these experts. 
Title V of the bill contains six subtitles on combating illegal drug use. Illegal drugs are too often at the heart of crime. This Act would help break the cycle of drug use by criminals, requiring States to test prisoners for drugs and to provide drug treatment programs, so that the convicts would not return to the streets still addicted, and still caught up in a cycle of crime. It would protect our children by increasing penalties for selling drugs to kids and drug trafficking in or near schools, and crack down on `club drugs.' It would go a step further and encourage pharmacotherapy research to develop medications for the treatment of drug addiction, a proposal Senator Biden has urged. It would fund drug courts, which subject eligible drug offenders to programs of intensive supervision. This title also would reauthorize the Drug Czar/Office of National Drug Control Policy, as Senator Biden has recommended in legislation he has introduced with bipartisan support. 
Title VI of the bill deals with criminal history records and the use of new technologies for law enforcement purposes. We can not underestimate the usefulness of criminal history records, which can help solve crimes and help prevent crimes. The bill contains the `Interstate Identification Index'(III) Compact to decentralize the FBI's maintenance of the national criminal history database and provide access to criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes in accordance with state rules. This provision has bipartisan support and has already passed the Senate. 
The compact is a reciprocal, voluntary system of sharing criminal history records (including juvenile records) for noncriminal justice purposes among the States and FBI that is efficient, more accurate than the current system, promises to save money, and allows each participating State to effectuate its own access policies. 
In addition, this title contains the `Crime Identification Technology Act,' to provide $250 million each year for five years in grants to States for identification and communications systems and forensic labs. This legislation has strong bipartisan support and has also already passed the Senate and is pending in the House. 
Title VII of the bill is intended to increase the right of victims who unfortunately become involved in the criminal justice system. The criminal is only half of the equation. We would guarantee the rights of crime victims. All States have some victims' rights laws on the books, but they lack the training and resources to make those rights a reality. This bill provides a model Bill of Rights for crime victims in the federal system, and makes available to the States grants to fund the hiring of State and Federal victim-witness advocates, training, and the technology necessary for model notification system. This bill would make victims' rights a reality. 
Specifically, this title reforms federal law and evidence to enhance victims' participation in all stages of criminal proceedings by giving victims a right to notice of detention hearings, plea agreements, sentencing, probation revocations, escapes or releases from prison, and to allocution at hearings, as well as grants for obtaining state-of-the-art systems for providing notice. In addition, this title would provide grant programs to study effectiveness of restorative justice approach for victims and to study crimes against persons with developmental disabilities and for development of strategies to combat such crimes. 
Title VIII of the bill details provisions for combating money laundering. Crime increasingly has an international face, from drug kingpins to millionaire terrorists, like Usama bin Laden. The money laundering provisions of this bill hit these international criminals where they live - in the pocketbook. 
These provisions would prove to be a key tool in winning the war on drugs. We must have interdiction; we must have treatment programs; we must tell kids to say `No' to drugs. But we have to do more, and taking the profit away from the drug lords is an effective weapon. This Democratic crime bill would strengthen these laws.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life work of Dr. Mariafranca Morselli. 
In 1964, it was our good fortune that Dr. Morselli joined the Maple Research team at the University of Vermont. She has been a family friend and an informal advisor to me for decades. 
Her research has considerably helped the Maple Syrup Industry to improve production methods and the quality and maple products. This work has been invaluable to my home state. 
Vermont is the largest producer of maple syrup in the United States. There are approximately 2000 sugarmakers in the state and the industry provides about 4000 jobs in Vermont. Maple sugaring is critical to maintaining the beauty of the working landscape of Vermont, providing added income to help family farms stay in business. 
We take great pride in the worldwide acclaim for the quality and taste of Vermont maple products. 
Dr. Morselli is a pioneer. She received her doctoral degree in Natural Sciences and Botany from the University of Milan, Italy in 1946, and taught in a college in Milan. After working in both Italy and the United States, she settled in Vermont to continue her research. 
In 1983, she was the first woman to received the Outstanding Service Award in research by the North American Maple Syrup Council. In 1988, she received three awards, each time as the first female recipient: the Research Service Award from the International Maple Syrup Institute; the Maple Syrup Person of the Year Award from the Vermont Maple Industry; and the Maple Syrup Producer of the Year Award from the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers' Association. In 1991, Dr. Morselli was the first woman to be inducted into the American Maple Hall of Fame. 
She also volunteers her time in activities related to improving education at all levels for women in math and science. She has been appointed to the Governor's Commission on Women and to the Vermont Developmental Disabilities Council. In recognition of her commitment to the role of women in academia, upon her retirement from the University of Vermont, students and colleagues established `The Mariafranca Morselli Leadership Award.' The award is given yearly to an undergraduate woman who has made special contribution as a scholar and in advancing equity for women. 
Mariafranca has incredible energy. In fact, in 1985, the Burlington Professional Women honored her as one of Vermont's Most Exciting Women. 
She never slows down. Earlier this month, Governor Dean of Vermont appointed Dr. Morselli to the state Affirmative Action Council. 
I applaud her tireless efforts to improve the world in which we live. I am proud to call Dr. Mariafranca Morselli my friend. I also want to mention how much her friendship meant to my late mother, Alba Leahy. My mother always enjoyed her conversation with Dr. Morselli. She especially enjoyed them because she could use her native tongue, Italian. 
I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks an article from the Burlington Free Press be included in the Congressional Record.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an event that has been a Vermont cultural tradition for twenty-five years. The Vermont Mozart Festival began in 1974, and through the vision of its founders, it has grown tremendously in popularity, today attracting over 17,000 advance ticket buyers for a series of 25 concerts in 16 different locations across the state. 
The international acclaim of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is clearly demonstrated by the long distances loyal festival attendees travel each year. Concert-goers flock from all across the United States, Canada and even as far away as Europe to hear top-caliber musicians perform world-class compositions. These faithful return year after year to hear the works of a variety of composers, with a primary focus on the symphonies, concertos and other brilliant works of Mozart. 
The festival is a tradition for the Leahy family. I was honored when the festival asked me to speak at a concert to honor its 25th anniversary. I took this opportunity to praise the musicians but also to acknowledge the dedication of the festival organizers and the expansive volunteer network, now numbering over 150. The fruits of their efforts are clear from the warm applause that bring the curtain down at the end of each performance.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, and also my good friend from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, have said that the majority is prepared to debate and vote on amendments to this bill. I know that a number of my colleagues want to bring amendments that are also important for the health and safety of American families and children. 
I have some concerns, as I have expressed to the Senator from Michigan, on the overall bill. But with the assurances that we are going to have debate--I am not talking about dilatory debate, I am talking about real debate and amendments--I am prepared to take Senator Hatch and others at their word and proceed to this bill and work through it. 
Having said that, I have some difficulties with aspects of the bill. I note for my colleagues that those difficulties go to particular constitutional and legal issues, not to the underlying concerns the Senator from Michigan has expressed. 
The Senator from Michigan has expressed some very real concerns, many of which I share. He has done it in a way that shows a deep, heartfelt concern, a concern of conscience, and I applaud him for that. We will work through these particular things in the same way. As the Senator from Michigan knows, I did not take steps to delay this bill from coming out of committee. This bill deserves to have a vote. We deserve, some of us, and probably both sides, to have a vote on some of the amendments. We will do that. 
I will urge my colleagues to vote to move forward with this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
I see nobody on our side looking for further time. I will yield, if this will help the Senator from Michigan, the remainder of my time to him, with the understanding that if somebody comes up I am sure he will take care of their time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday, after Senators had been informed that there would be no more votes that day and after I had already headed for home to Vermont, Republicans came to the floor to propose a narrow procedural device in connection with the Republican juvenile crime bill, S.10. 
No one had advised me that the Senate Republican leadership planned to proceed to S.10 on Thursday. After a year of inaction on this bill--which was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997--the Republicans did not even seek a response to their proposal. Instead, they rushed to the floor in ambush fashion. 
The failure of this Congress to take up and pass responsible juvenile crime legislation does not rest with the Democrats, and no procedural floor gimmick by the Republican majority can change that fact. 
Over the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at hearings on several occasions about my concerns with this legislation. At the same time, I have expressed my willingness to work with the Chairman in a bipartisan manner to improve this juvenile crime bill. 
I am not alone in my criticisms and in wanting to see changes in this bill. It has been blasted by virtually every major newspaper in the United States. The Philadelphia Inquirer concluded that the bill `is fatally flawed and should be rejected.' The Los Angeles Times described the bill as `peppered with ridiculous poses and penalties' and as taking a `rigid, counterproductive approach' to juvenile crime prevention. The St. Petersburg Times called the bill `an amalgam of bad and dangerous ideas.' 
The bill has also been criticized by national leaders ranging from Chief Justice Rehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund. 
In May, the Chief Justice criticized S.10 because it would `eviscerate this traditional deference to state prosecutions, thereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal judiciary.' Earlier in the year, the Chief Justice raised concerns about `federalizing' certain juvenile crimes, noting that `federal prosecutions should be limited to those offenses that cannot and should not be prosecuted in the state courts.' 
The National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) and other law enforcement agencies have also written me with their concerns about this bill. In May, William Murphy, President of the NDAA, expressed NDAA's serious concerns about parts of S.10, including the fact that `S.10 goes too far' in changing the `core mandates' which have kept juveniles safer and away from adults while in jail for over 25 years. Mr. Murphy also criticized S.10's new juvenile record keeping requirements as `burdensome and contrary to most state laws.' He further noted that S.10 failed to provide `any lee way to give juveniles a second chance by providing for the option to seal or expunge records.' 
I have also heard from numerous State and local officials across the U.S., including the National Governors' Association, the Council of State Governments (Eastern Regional Conference), the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties and the National Conference of State Legislatures. All of them have expressed concerns about the restrictions this bill would place on their ability to combat and prevent juvenile crime effectively. Last June, the President of the National Conference of State Legislatures cautioned that the new mandates placed on the States by S.10 could `imbalance the constitutionally designed relationship between the federal government and the states.' 
He further noted that `[s]tates handle crime in a more flexible and more responsive manner than the federal government' and urged the Senate not to impose a single `federal `fix' upon all fifty states and the territories.' 
In short, S.10 as reported by the Judiciary Committee is a bill laden with problems--so much so that, at last count, the bill has lost a quarter of its Republican cosponsors since introduction. 
The unanimous consent agreement proposed by the Republicans would limit debate of juvenile justice and other crime matters. Ironically, it would permit the Republicans to offer a substitute to their own bill, but not allow Democrats the same opportunity. The only additional amendments in order under their plan would be five on each side. 
When the Judiciary Committee Chairman indicated on the floor that the minority has had the text of the proposed Hatch-Sessions substitute for `well over a month,' he was incorrect. In fact, we only got a copy of the substitute on the same day that the Republicans proposed their unanimous consent agreement and had not had an opportunity to review it. 
While I appreciate that we are short of time in this Congress and that, consequently, the Republican leadership would like to limit the number of amendments the Democrats may offer, I must point out that the Hatch-Sessions substitute alone contains substantial changes to over 160 separate paragraphs of this reported bill. 
While I do not believe that Democrats will have close to 160 additional amendments to the bill, I believe that we will want to offer more than five. 
We are continuing to pare down the amendments that Democrats plan to offer to S.10 to address the substantial criticisms leveled at this bill. We are continuing to negotiate in good faith on a unanimous consent agreement to ensure that Senate consideration of this legislation is fair, full and productive. The attempted ambush at the outset of this process, however, suggests that the Republican leadership is more interested in placing blame for its inaction than in actually moving to consideration of the bill.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me go back to the basic reason we are debating this Compact today. This Compact is before the Senate today because we shifted the responsibility to manage low-level nuclear waste to the states almost a decade ago. Congress encouraged the states to enter into compacts to share this responsibility. Forty-one states have already followed our direction by entering into compacts very similar to the one we have before us today. With the expectation that Congress would ratify their compact, just like we have nine other times, the states of Texas, Vermont and Maine entered into this Compact. 
That was more than four years ago. We have delayed this Compact long enough. The amendments that Senator Wellstone offered to the Compact when it passed the Senate earlier this year would delay implementation of this Compact even further. When the Conference Committee considered these amendments, we not only heard opposition to the amendments from the National Governors' Association and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but also from each of the governors of Texas, Maine and Vermont. 
Their letter urges Congress to pass the Compact without amendments. The letter makes it clear that the governors believe that the amendments would require re-ratification by the states and would undoubtedly lead to costly and time-consuming litigation. But their letter raises what I think is the most important question: what is our role in ratifying this Compact? Congress has passed nine other compacts without any amendments. In fact, we passed them by unanimous consent. So why is this Compact so different? Contrary to Senator Wellstone's statement, the Compact makes no mention of a site. Nowhere in this legislation will you find a mention of Sierra Blanca, Texas. The people of Texas will make a decision for themselves. The Compact will not. 
We are not here to select the site for them. We are not here to write the Compact agreement for them. We are not here to decide how much waste should be deposited at the facility or where that waste should come from. The states have already made those decisions for themselves. As the governors pointed out, the Wellstone amendments would have been an `infringement on state sovereignty.' It would have been the first time Congress amended an original contract negotiated by the states. Inclusion of these amendments in the Compact would deny the states the right Congress gave them to make their own choices as to how to handle disposal of low-level nuclear waste. 
The amendments offered to the Compact by Senator Wellstone were inappropriate. I can understand Senator Wellstone's concern that too many sources of pollution and waste facilities are targeted to minority and low-income areas, but one of his amendments would have created new opportunities for litigation that go far beyond the `environmental justice' guidance recently proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The amendment would also apply federal environmental justice standards to states for the first time. Congress should address the issue of environmental justice. But we should take the time to do it right, not through amendments to an agreement between three states that are following the lead of nine other similar agreements. 
The second amendment attached by Senator Wellstone also expands the role of Congress in approving these compacts. This Compact is the result of years of negotiation among the three states and approved by the legislatures of those states. Senator Wellstone argues that his amendment would give Texas protection from having to accept waste from states other than Maine and Vermont. However, the Compact already gives Texas the majority vote in deciding if and from whom additional waste may come. This amendment is unnecessary and would only lead to further delay of the Compact since it will likely require re-ratification by the member states. In fact, under the Wellstone amendment, Texas may be more open to accepting waste from other states because it would not have the protection of the exclusionary provisions of the Compact. 
The States of Texas, Maine and Vermont have done their job. They have negotiated a compact among them to provide for the responsible disposal of low-level radioactive waste and submitted it to this body as required under Federal statute, for the consent of the Congress. Now, we need to do our job. Those Senators who support the basic premise that we agreed to in 1980, that states should have the responsibility to dispose of their waste, should vote for this bill. It is the responsibility of Congress to follow through on the direction we gave to states in 1980 and ratify this Compact.  
Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while waiting for others, I note with regard to the North Korea McCain amendment that I stand behind no Member of this body in my respect for my friend from Arizona, and certainly I know no one who has followed the situation in North Korea closer than he has. I give him a great deal of weight for his insight. I understand his concerns. I share them. I suspect that most Senators do, especially as we watched the unbelievably irresponsible activity on the part of North Korea in their recent missile firing. 
Unfortunately, this amendment would prevent the United States from fulfilling its obligations under the Korea nuclear reactor agreement. Maybe the Congress will make that decision to do that. Of course the Congress can. But I hope that Senators would think long and hard before we go down that road. This North Korea agreement is not perfect. There is no disagreement about that on this side of the aisle. There is also no disagreement about the behavior of the North Korean Government. It is reprehensible. At times it seems inexplicable. It is certainly the most irresponsible activity of any country on Earth today. They almost seem to want the United States to back out of this agreement. 
But I think the questions we should ask, if I could have the attention of my friend from Arizona, would be just these: 
Does the Secretary of Defense support this amendment? Does the commander of our forces in Korea support the amendment? What do they think the level of danger between the United States and North Korea will be with this amendment? 
I ask this because I share the frustration of the Senator from Arizona toward North Korea.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his answer, which is precisely what I anticipated. I am not suggesting experts are in opposition. I merely wanted, for purposes of debate, to have that. 
He speaks of these Orwellian, bizarre people. I suspect it is giving the North Korean leadership the benefit of the doubt to call them Orwellian and bizarre. They are worse than that. We can't ignore what has happened there. But we are not dealing with rationale people. 
Had I been the one to write the agreement we have with them, I would like to think that I would have written it a lot differently than it is. But I also understand the concerns that countries like South Korea, Japan, and others have put a lot more money and a lot more effort into this agreement than the United States has. 
I do not want to give the North Korean Government an excuse to make the situation we now have a lot worse. 
We have done some things with this agreement. The North Korean nuclear facility at Yongbyon and Taechom have been frozen under the IAEA inspection. Virtually all of the spent fuel in the Yongbyon reactor has been safely canned under IAEA seals. Those are spelled forth. 
At the same time, this is a country which I think both the Senator from Arizona and I would agree has the ability to make inspections. The ability to determine what they are doing is probably as difficult as any country in the world. What makes it worse, unlike some other countries where it is difficult to find out what they are doing, they are not countries with the potential nuclear power and potential nuclear weapons power. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. 
I withhold the suggestion of the absence of a quorum. I see the Senator from Arizona on the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut has made a very, very strong and a very good statement in support of his amendment. 
The Senator from Connecticut is one of the most knowledgeable people, if not the most knowledgeable Senator, on Central and Latin American matters. He has traveled many times to the region, he speaks fluent Spanish, and he has been consistent in speaking up for the rights of American citizens and of the Central American people. 
I have often worried that because of our own complicity, either active or accidental, we have allowed the coverup of some very serious misdeeds in that part of the world. 
After the murder of the Jesuits, I was very critical of the investigation of those heinous crimes. I was asked to go down so the Salvadoran authorities could show me how they were conducting an investigation to get the perpetrators. 
And I went to see the chief investigator, the prosecutor. 
Now, Mr. President, a murder case is a relatively easy crime to prosecute. Any of us who has prosecuted murder cases knows that. You have a dead body, you have certain physical evidence, and you put it together. It was so obvious that the evidence of the murders of the Jesuits had been destroyed, covered up, removed. Members of our own Government were well aware of this and didn't want to blow the whistle. I did in a press conference, and I quickly left the country, I might say, because of threats against me for doing it. 
What the Senator from Connecticut proposes by this amendment is to protect, among others, our own citizens. People like Sister Diana Ortiz, who have tried for years to find out what her own government knows about what was done to her, and possibly who was involved. There are other crimes that were covered up, including by U.S. officials. If mistakes were made or crimes committed in Central America we should know about them. It is, after all, it is information in the possession of our own Government. 
The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut protects information that should be kept secret in the interests of national security. But too often, information that should not be kept secret has been withheld, information which could shed light on atrocities and the fate of people who disappeared. That is wrong. I might ask this question of my friend from Connecticut. Would it be safe to say that his amendment protects our legitimate national security interests, while it seeks to obtain information about crimes that were committed that the American people have every right to know about?

Mr. LEAHY. Well, Mr. President, I say to my friend from Connecticut, that really is the point. In my years here, I have seen time and time again a resolution or amendment to condemn this or that country that violates human rights. They usually pass virtually unanimously. That is fine. We should stand up for human right wherever they occur. But we are now asking our own government for information about Americans whose human rights were violated, and we get pages and pages that are blacked out. That is unacceptable. We should at least be able to tell the families of Americans who disappeared or who were murdered or tortured as much as we can about these crimes. 
Frankly, we cannot credibly condemn other countries for their misdeeds, and not be willing to find out what happened to our own citizens because possibly, conceivably, somebody in our Government may have broken the law. If they did we should know about it, and if the truth comes out we can hold people accountable and deter others from covering up crimes in the future. So I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a statement relating to an amendment I had intended to offer concerning the Global Environment Facility, which I have decided not to offer in the interest of finishing action on this bill. There is strong, bipartisan support for the GEF and I hope we can find additional funds for it later in this session. 
Mr. President, this bill contains $47 million to pay a portion of our arrears to the Global Environment Facility. An amendment I had planned to offer would provide an additional $145 million, which would cover our outstanding arrears which currently total $192 million. Unfortunately, there is no money in the bill to pay our FY 1999 contribution to the GEF. 
The Balanced Budget Act provides for an automatic adjustment of the discretionary budget caps to accommodate these additional arrears, so my amendment would not require an offset or any additional budget authority. 
Mr. President, if we are going to provide $47 million toward the arrears we owe the GEF, we should provide the whole amount. There is no reason not to do it. That was one of the purposes of the Balanced Budget agreement. 
It does not require additional budget authority. But it we miss this chance, we will make it virtually impossible to pay these arrears later on when we no longer have the benefit of the automatic adjustment under the Balanced Budget Act. 
The GEF is the world's largest environmental organization. It has enjoyed bipartisan support in the Congress for years. It funds projects to protect biodiversity, stop ocean pollution, prevent ozone depletion, and promote energy conservation. 
A few Members of the Congress have called the GEF a `back-door' funding mechanism for the Kyoto Protocol. What is the evidence of that? The GEF was established years before Kyoto was even conceived of. For years, the GEF has been pushing the developing countries to do more to prevent global warming. Kyoto has not changed that. If anything, it has made it even more relevant and timely. 
The Resolution on Kyoto sponsored by Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel earlier this year calls on the developing countries to do more to prevent global warming. 
That is one of the GEF's goals, and a reason why we should support it. 
The GEF is not only good for the environment, it is good for U.S. business. American contractors have won 30 percent of the GEF contracts awarded to donor countries. These contracts have primarily gone to American companies involved in environmental engineering, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. The U.S. is the world's leader in these areas, and our companies will reap the rewards as the GEF helps the developing countries confront their exploding populations, huge energy demands, and a legacy of ignoring the consequences of environmental pollution. 
The GEF has funded over 500 projects in 119 countries. Each dollar the U.S. contributes is matched by 5 dollars from other donors and 10 dollars from the developing countries themselves, private companies, and other international institutions. But without strong U.S. participation there is far less incentive for other countries to contribute. 
Mr. President, I am reluctant to call this free money, since no money is free. But this is about as free as any money we are going to see. My amendment would not require one dime of additional budget authority for us to erase $192 million in past commitments to an organization that deserves our strong support. 
Mr. President, to expedite completion of this bill at this late hour, I have agreed to withhold offering my amendment. However, is is my fervent hope that we will revisit this issue, and that if additional budget authority becomes available later this session that we use some of it to make a contribution to the GEF for FY 1999, and that we make the cap adjustment provided for under the Balanced Budget Act to cover the $192 million in arrears that would be made available under my amendment. To do so would not affect any of the other funds in this bill, but it would fulfill our commitment to pay these arrears, and support the most important international organization devoted to protecting the environment.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have agreed to strike section 578 of the bill which contains a reporting requirement relating to arms sales. I have done so in response to a request by the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
However, both Senator Helms and Senator Biden have agreed that they will include a modified version of this reporting provision which has been negotiated and agreed upon by myself, Senator Helms, Senator Biden, and Senator McConnell in legislation that has been reported by the Foreign Relations Committee and which is expected to be acted on by the Senate later this month. If that legislation is not adopted by the Senate or the reporting provision is not included in whatever version of that legislation becomes law, Senator Helms, Senator Biden, and Senator McConnell have agreed to support its inclusion in the FY 1999 Foreign Operations Conference Report, a Continuing Resolution, or whatever other legislative vehicle is appropriate. My purpose in striking section 578 is to give the Foreign Relations Committee an opportunity to include the modified reporting provision in its legislation, but to ensure that if that fails it is included in a legislative vehicle that becomes law.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first off, I thank my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, for his kind remarks. We have tried to work very closely together on this. It is something that is not a happy chore for either one of us. The meeting we had today was nearly 3 hours, as I recall. He and I went off and had lunch afterward and discussed it. I think it accomplished a great deal. He and his counterpart in the House, Chairman Hyde, did a service for the Congress and for the country by patiently working out what I believe could have been a very difficult situation with the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee contempt resolution against the Attorney General. He has helped all people, Republicans and Democrats, and I commend the Senator from Utah for that. 
The Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General and all the others who have been listed by the Senator from Utah, as I said, spent nearly 3 hours together today. The Attorney General explained, as she has in the past in public hearings, her reasons for not appointing an independent counsel to take over the ongoing Department investigation of allegations of wrongdoing in the 1996 Presidential election. She also provided us on a confidential basis internal Department memoranda in this matter. 
Without going into what is in those memoranda, I mention the fact that she made them available for our review because it is unprecedented. And I, for one, appreciate the way the Attorney General has tried to keep Congress, in its oversight capacity, informed. 
This is a serious matter. Whether or not the Attorney General should appoint an independent counsel has diverted the attention of a number of committees, both here in the Senate and the House, and a number of Members. It is a difficult thing because there are grand jury rules that have to be followed, there are secrecy rules that have to be followed, and there are internal procedures that have to be followed that sometimes may not allow for an instant response between the time a question is asked and the evening news. 
The Attorney General has referred matters to independent counsels at least 10 times, if you count both the requests she has made for appointments of new independent counsels or expansions of the jurisdictions of those independent counsels already operating. So she does not shy away from exercising her discretion under the independent counsel statute. 
I do not want to see us get involved in some kind of intense second-guessing and arm-twisting of the Attorney General when she has shown she is willing to trigger an independent counsel statute, as she has done 10 times already. This goes for when she has declined to do so as well. So whether one agrees or disagrees with the Attorney General's decision on appointing independent counsels, or decisions not to appoint independent counsels--and one can agree or disagree--but what we as Senators want to be careful about, what we must be careful about, is not to politicize what is already becoming an overly politicized process. The meeting this morning was designed to bring down the decibel level. I do not want to be in a position to increase it. 
I give the Attorney General credit for playing it straight with Members of Congress in both parties; for always being available and willing to explain her reasons to the extent she can without jeopardizing ongoing investigations or violating grand jury secrecy rules. 
I have been here with five administrations and dealt with Attorneys General through all of them. There are some things that they cannot share with us and have to wait on, either because of grand jury rules or ongoing investigations, before they can discuss them. 
This Attorney General is not going to be pushed around by anybody in Congress. I would be concerned if she allowed herself to be pushed around. We have had discussions about internal debates that have taken place within the Department of Justice and the FBI on whether in this or that or in another instance an independent counsel should be appointed. I would certainly hope there would be an internal debate. These are very, very serious matters. If we had a Department of Justice or an FBI where internally, on every single issue, everybody walked in lockstep, my question would be what have they missed? 
I never remember prosecuting a case of any seriousness or complexity when I was a prosecutor, but with the police or the investigators or other members of my office having some internal debate. `Are we bringing the right charge? Are we bringing enough charges? Are we bringing too strong a charge? Should we withhold charges?' And nothing I ever had to deal with began to reach the significance of what the Attorney General is dealing with. 
So will there be internal debate? Of course there will be. Should there be internal debate? Of course there should be. But under the law, at some point the buck stops on her desk, and she has to make that decision. Once she has made that decision, fine. If we disagree, let us say so. But understand that she has to make it. 
Prosecutors have enormous power. The trust and the confidence of the American people in our justice system would evaporate if this Attorney General or any Attorney General allowed politics to dictate decisions like these. I don't think she is doing that. I believe, this is confirmed by listening to even some in the Department of Justice who have disagreed with her decisions. They have all said, unanimously, that they understand she is looking at this very, very honestly. She has made her decisions very directly and very honestly. 
People from both the FBI and within the Department of Justice, when asked specifically, `Was anybody put off limits? Was any part of the investigation put off limits?', they said unanimously nothing was put off limits. They were not told to put anybody or any transaction or any activity off limits. 
So I think we will see more on this as days go on. I think the meeting this morning was a valuable one and I commend my friend from Utah for having the meeting. Many aspects of this we agree on. Some aspects we may disagree on. But I state to my friend from Utah he has been fair and open with us on this. If we have disagreements, they are honest disagreements. But he and I will continue to work closely on this because in the end what we want to see, whatever these questions are, is that we have them resolved fairly. And I think we agree on that. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year we completed debate on the foreign operations bill in record time. This year the bill contains $250 million less than last year, so I hope it will take even less time. 
The bill represents a delicate compromise. As I said, we have a lot less money this year, and since almost half the funds in this bill is earmarked for the Middle East, the quarter-billion-dollar cut from last year has to come out of other programs. That is a very significant cut. It is over $1 billion below the President's request. 
A quarter of a billion dollars may not be a lot in some budgets, like the defense budget, but it is a great deal when it means cuts in funding for diplomacy and programs to--and I will give you examples of the areas we are cutting--support for U.S. exports, or to promote economic reforms in the former Soviet Union and democracy in Indonesia, or to aid refugees in Bosnia and support business exchange programs in Eastern Europe, or money to combat the spread of illegal drugs and infectious diseases. Infectious diseases--Mr. President, I remind everybody that the most virulent disease in the world is only an airplane trip away from any one of our homes in the United States. And, of course, money to protect the environment. 
These are but a few examples of what is in this bill and what we have had to cut because of this year's low budget allocation. 
Having said that, I commend the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Senator McConnell has done an outstanding job to try to make the most of the funds we have in as balanced a way as possible. No one can be entirely happy with what we have done, because we don't have the money to make everybody happy. I think the chairman has done his best to honor the many requests of the Senators on both sides of the aisle and to fund the foreign policy priorities of the United States. 
I also thank the committee chairman, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their help. They have a difficult job in trying to balance the interests of all the appropriations subcommittees. I know they have tried to give us the funds we need and, at the same time, stay within the parameters of the balanced budget agreement. 
I simply note that the entire foreign operations budget amounts to less than 1 percent of the Federal budget, but these are the funds we use besides the defense budget to promote our influence around the world. There is not a Senator here who does not want to protect our national interests. Those national interests can be in Korea or they can be in our own hemisphere. But for the United States, the most powerful, wealthiest nation history has ever known, the United States which has become that way because we have worldwide interests, it is hard to point to any part of the world on any continent of the world where our interests are not involved. All of us like to say, `Well, we are the United States--we should influence this, that, or the other thing in the world.' If we are going to do that, we have to have the power to do it, too. 
It is like saying you want to go to such and such a spot, in your State, but if there are no roads and no way to get there, then you are not going to do it. And the cost to carry out our responsibilities and to project our influence worldwide is not something that is going to be picked up by the State or local governments. 
These programs are not `foreign handouts' as some have called it. They are going to determine the kind of world in which our children and grandchildren live 10, 20, 50 years hence. 
Frankly, I do not believe this bill adequately funds our foreign policy and national security needs. As a superpower that is increasingly dependent on the global economy--in the last 2 days if there is anybody who did not realize we were dependent on the global economy, wake up; we are. As a superpower intent on solving global problems by leading by example, I think we are going to look back years from now and wonder why we were so shortsighted. 
Leadership and security are not just abstract concepts, they cost money. The amount in this bill is a pittance for a superpower that has important interests to protect on every continent, important American interests to protect on every continent. 
Mr. President, if history is any guide, I think the chairman and I can expect there will be Senators who have amendments to shift funds from one account to another in this bill. They may feel we have done too little for their favorite program. And they may be right. But we had to make some very painful choices, choices we would not have had to make if we had a larger budget to begin with. The chairman and I are going to have to oppose such amendments. 
This is a very delicately put together piece of legislation, based on the allocation we have. I might have done things differently if I were chairman. And the 98 other men and women in this body may have each done it somewhat differently. But we have to have one bill. The Senator from Kentucky and I have worked very closely together to balance the interests of both sides of the aisle, the interests of the United States and the interests of the administration, the interests of the U.S. Senate. With the funds we have, I think we should go forward with this bill as it is. If there are amendments, I would hope that they come up; if there are not, I am prepared to go to third reading. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is right. I support the pending amendment. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss with the subcommittee chairman, Senator McConnell, his amendments to modify section 540(b) and section 752(a) of the bill, modifications which I strongly support. 
It is my understanding that the purpose of the change to section 540(b) is to make clear that funds in the bill may be used, notwithstanding any other provision of law, to support energy programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, because of concerns expressed by certain senators that requests to AID for specific information about these activities was not provided and that they therefore have been unable to determine precisely what these funds were used for, they requested that these funds be subject to the Committees' regular notification procedures. Does the subcommittee chairman agree that the purpose of subjecting these funds to the notification procedures is not to prevent funding for these activities notwithstanding any other provision of law, since we could have done that by simply leaving the section as it is, but rather to be sure that the Congress gets the information it requests?

Mr. LEAHY. Thank you. I would like to take another minute to ask the subcommittee chairman about section 572(a) of the bill, which makes funds available for certain environmental activities subject to the regular notification procedures of the committees. The language is quite broad, and it includes any activities promoting country participation in the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Again, I want to be clear about the purpose of this provision. It is my understanding that, like section 540(b), it was included due to concerns expressed by some senators that AID has not been sufficiently responsive to requests for information about the expenditure of certain funds for these activities. The information that was provided was very general and did not fully describe what the funds were used for. It is my understanding that this provision does not seek to prevent funding for these activities, but instead aims to ensure that when senators request AID to provide specific information about its use of these funds the information is provided in a timely way.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kentucky, I said earlier we did it in record time last year. We may break that now. Again, I am perfectly willing to go forward and wrap it up. There may be some who feel otherwise. 
COMMUNITY-BASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
Mr. President, organizations such as the National Telephone Cooperative Association are able to help provide new and innovative methods to bring modern telecommunications service to rural and remote areas around the globe. Such initiatives, particularly those that encompass a grass-roots, community-based approach, are key to economic development, business creation and income generation. They enhance economic stability, create jobs, improve agricultural production and further the development of democratic processes and traditions. 
The committee has, in the past, encouraged AID to work with organizations like the National Telephone Cooperative Association to bring modern means of communication to rural areas. Cooperatives foster community involvement and help to build civil society--important steps along the path away from a socialist, government-controlled economy toward a free-market economy. These programs are just the type that we should be promoting in the Ukraine and other NIS states, where any growth in the private sector represents a challenge to the government and encourages sustainable income generation and economic growth on a local level. 
Another program that the committee urged AID to support was rural telephone cooperative programs in Poland, which have achieved significant success. The on-going program in the Philippines has also seen success. However, this project is in need of continued participation by AID's country and central programs. AID should also promote the development of telephone cooperatives in Africa. Countries in the Horn, Ghana, and South Africa are poised for developing useful rural telecommunications. There is no doubt that in addition to promoting economic growth, rural citizens in these countries would benefit enormously. 
For these reasons, I encourage AID to continue to work with telephone cooperatives in the United States to foster community-based telecommunications programs in the developing countries. I hope that language to this effect can be included in the conference report on this bill. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of Congress that information relevant to the murders of four American churchwomen in El Salvador be made public to the fullest extent possible. My understanding is that it is acceptable to both sides. 
It was 18 years ago, but the 1980 brutal murders of four American churchwomen by members of the Salvadoran National Guard is seared in our memory. Since that time the victims' families have sought answers to questions about the nuns' untimely deaths. Some have been answered, many have not. It is unfortunate that after so many years, it is still necessary to offer an amendment to urge the administration to release any information that would shed light on what happened in this case. It should have been done years ago. 
To its credit, the State Department did promptly respond to Congressional requests and fully release information about these horrific crimes. Other agencies have not. Far too often in this case and others like it, the response to requests for information has come grudgingly, and then only in the form of heavily redacted documents with a few lines of practically meaningless text. 
I appreciate the need to protect intelligence sources and methods, but these American citizens were murdered almost two decades ago. 
For years there have been allegations and evidence to indicate that the National Guardsmen convicted of these crimes acted after receiving orders from their superiors. 
In March 1998, after 14 years of silence, four of the convicted men confessed that this was the case. Recently, it has become known that even though U.S. officials had reason to believe these crimes were ordered and covered up by higher authorities, at least one of those Salvadoran officers was granted permanent residence and is reportedly living in Florida. 
In addition to calling for the release of information, this amendment also directs the Attorney General to review the circumstances under which individuals connected with these crimes obtained residence in the United States. It is a tragic irony that with so many people legitimately seeking asylum upon our shores, we may have opened our doors to individuals who belong behind bars.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thought the Senator was going to be speaking longer. 
Mr. President, I would like to read what is in the bill. It says: 
It is the policy of the U.S. Government to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction as soon as practicable. 
That is a convention that has now been signed by some 129 nations, including every one of our NATO allies except Turkey and every other Western Hemisphere country except Cuba. It says we will sign it as soon as practicable. It does not set a deadline. Other nations far less powerful than the United States have said they can sign it, but we have not signed it. We have said that even though we are the most powerful nation history has ever known, we are not powerful enough to sign the anti-landmine treaty, but we wish other nations would. And we have encouraged other nations to give up their landmines, in laudatory fashion--nations nowhere near as powerful as we, nations that face a lot more threats on their borders than we. 
Mr. President, I happen to disagree with the President of the United States in that regard. I do agree with my friend from Oklahoma that both he and I are concerned about the men and women that we send into combat. My son is a marine. He is a rifleman in the Marine Corps. When he was called up for Desert Storm, his MOL was carry the SAW, light machine gun, and he was listed as a `casualty replacement,' encouraging terminology for parents of all young marines who are so listed--the idea that they are the ones who go first into combat carrying a gun with others behind them to pick up the guns, the weapons, and so on, if the first one falls, which in this instance would have been our son. 
Now, we are fortunate the war ended so quickly that neither he nor the others in his unit ended up in harm's way. But I have to assume he may be called up again. And as a parent and a U.S. Senator, the last thing in the world I want to do is anything that increases the threat to our own troops or that in any way diminishes our ability to defend ourselves. 
But having said that, I am also struck by the number of generals, the number of combat leaders, including the retired commander in chief in Korea, including the former supreme allied commander of NATO in Europe, including a number of others who have called for such a ban on landmines because it has become such a double-edged sword, aside from the fact that most people who are killed by landmines today are civilians, not combatants. 
The United States was the first Nation in the world to actually pass landmine ban legislation, legislation that banned the export of landmines from this country, something hotly contested in this Chamber. And in a rollcall vote, 100 Senators voted for that amendment, voted for the Leahy law, and it became law--100 U.S. Senators across the political spectrum. In fact, many have said that that legislation was the trigger that got us to where we are today, where 129 nations have signed the Ottawa Treaty. 
We expect 40 ratifications by next month. That is the fastest that any international humanitarian law or arms control treaty has ever in history come into force. I think that shows the tremendous international support and momentum for this treaty and for the end to the endless slaughter of innocent people by landmines. 
Now, the United States has not signed it, and even if the United States does sign it, even if the United States does sign it, it then has to come to the Senate where two-thirds of the Senators present and voting have to vote to approve such a treaty before the President can ratify it. The President of the United States cannot ratify such a treaty unless two-thirds of the Senators present and voting vote to allow him to ratify it. And actually, if we did, he still doesn't have to ratify it but, of course, would. 
Mr. President, even though a majority of the Senators in this body have signed legislation, cosponsored legislation that would ban United States use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea, in an attempt to work closely with the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and particularly General Ralston for whom I have immeasurable respect, the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Adviser, I worked hard to agree on an approach that was acceptable to everyone. The language in this bill, which the Senator from Oklahoma wants to modify, is consistent with that agreement. My language simply says it is our policy to sign the treaty as soon as practicable. And that reflects the understanding that the administration is searching aggressively for alternatives to landmines. And General Ralston has assured me that they are doing that and I have confidence in him. 
Incidentally, several types of landmines we use are not prohibited by the Ottawa Treaty, neither command detonated Claymore mines, nor anti-tank mines. But I am concerned that my friend from Oklahoma now wants to give a veto to a whole lot of other people. The fact of the matter is, no treaty is going to come up here with any chance of being approved by two-thirds of the Senate unless the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and everybody else support it. But the Senator from Oklahoma wants to require that each of the unified combatant commanders has to agree--it apparently isn't enough that the Commander in Chief, or the Secretary of Defense, agrees. 
I have dealt in good faith with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President and the National Security Adviser and the Secretary of Defense. My language reflects that. And I agreed not to oppose a waiver of my moratorium legislation, and other things that the Pentagon wanted. The amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma places that agreement in jeopardy. 
I know there may be others who wish to speak. I will give a longer tutorial on the landmines issue later today or tomorrow. But let's be clear. My language does not have us ratifying the Ottawa Treaty or anything like that. We are not ratifying it here, even though 40 of those nations will have done so very shortly, the fastest that any international law or arms control treaty has ever been agreed to come into force. No. Even with my language, the United States is still one of the lone holdouts in the world. Certainly among our NATO allies we are the most significant holdout. 
I tell my friend from Oklahoma, if he went to some of the parts of the world where we use the Leahy War Victims Fund and saw the numbers of civilians blown apart by landmines, he would understand my concerns. And if he received the letters or talked to the military officers I have talked to who have been injured, or seen their fellow soldiers killed or wounded by our own landmines, he would understand. And if he had heard some of the speeches by our allies who ask why the most powerful nation on Earth wants them to give up their landmines but refuses to give up ours, then he would also understand my concern. 
Mr. President, I will have more to say and I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
I withhold that, Mr. President, if the Senator from Oklahoma wishes to speak. I withhold the suggestion of the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. I will just respond briefly. Is the Senator speaking of holding onto landmines that the Joint Chiefs have already said they are prepared to give up? Command detonated landmines are still available. We use those in Korea and elsewhere. Nothing bans those in this treaty. And as for self-destruct mines, the President has already said the Pentagon will give them up outside Korea by 2003, and in Korea by 2006. The Pentagon has also said it is searching aggressively for alternatives to the use of anti-personnel mines in mixed mine systems. These are self-destructing mines. So if there are military officers who are saying they oppose finding alternatives to these mines, they are speaking out of school. That is not consistent with the Pentagon's policy. 
My friend from Arizona speaks of having the military's input. Of course we should have the military's input. If we were to sign any treaty of this nature, we would. And we would require two-thirds of the Senators to vote for it before the President could even ratify such a treaty. 
A lot is made of Korea. Obviously we are concerned about the defense of Korea. But I say to my friends, talk to the former commander of our forces there, General Hollingsworth, or General Emerson. They say landmines caused more problems for our forces than they solved. Our forces are highly mobile. You don't want to impede their mobility by sowing a lot of landmines around. But anyway, the Pentagon has already said it is going to find alternatives to landmines in Korea.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, thank you. I thank my colleague from Minnesota. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Texas Low-Level Nuclear Waste Compact. This legislation was originally introduced in the 103rd Congress and is long overdue. 
Although this legislation is fairly simple on its face, merely approving a Compact already agreed to by each of the party states, many issues have arisen along the way to complicate the approval of the Compact. 
We have before us the Conference Report to the Compact that works out these issues. This Conference Report insures that the will of the party states is followed. 
When Congress passed the 1980 Low-Level Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we handed over to states the responsibility of low-level waste disposal and encouraged them to enter into compacts to provide disposal on a collective basis. 
Nine of these compacts have already been approved by Congress. In this case, the states of Vermont, Maine and Texas negotiated the terms of their Compact, all three states approved the Compact and all three governors have urged Congress to ratify it. 
Approval of this Compact will give these states final resolution of the problem they increasingly face in disposing of their nuclear waste. 
In Vermont, we began this process almost ten years ago. Following the direction of Congress, Vermont began looking for an in-state depository location. In 1990, former Governor Kunin created the Vermont Low-Level Radioactive Waste Authority to determine if there was a suitable site for a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility in Vermont. 
Over the next two years the Authority spent approximately $5 million evaluating numerous sites in our state. In particular, the Authority examined the potential for a site next to Vermont Yankee in Vernon, Vermont. The site was found to have extremely unfavorable geological conditions for a storage facility. 
The combination of porous soil, a high groundwater table, a wet climate and proximity to the Connecticut River made such a site too risky.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, some critics of this Compact argue that the waste should be stored where it is generated. Although this argument is nobly egalitarian, it is not practical nor is it safe. 
We cannot control the rainfall in Vermont. We cannot change the density of our soil. And we cannot move the people of Vernon out of the area to meet the criteria of a safe disposal site. So, Vermont had to look somewhere else. 
Under this Compact, Texas has agreed to be the host for the disposal site. The Compact does not name a specific site. That is an issue to be decided by the people of Texas, as it should be. 
Every other compact approved by Congress gives the host state the right to choose where the disposal facility is sited, according to the laws and regulations of that state. The same is true for this Compact. 
Mr. President, I want to take a minute to talk about the process undertaken by Texas to site this storage facility. In 1991, the Texas legislature adopted legislation designating an area of 400 square miles (256,000 acres) in which the Texas Low-Level Authority was required to select a proposed site. 
After performing site screening in the area defined by the legislature, the Texas Authority identified a 16,000-acre tract for further analysis, of which 1,300-acres would be used for the proposed site. Texas undertook a siting and licensing process similar to the federal National Environmental Policy (NEPA) process, which included numerous public hearings and technical and environmental reviews. 
This process was recently reviewed by the two administrative law judges from the Texas Office of Administrative Hearings, who recommended the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission conduct additional analysis before the facility is licensed. The Governor and the State Legislature set up a process to select a site, which should be allowed to more forward. 
Congress should not put special restrictions on this Compact simply because Texas is exercising its rights as the host state to determine where the facility will be located. 
This Compact also allows the states of Vermont, Maine and Texas to refuse waste from other states. Specifically, Texas will be able to limit the amount of low-level waste coming into its facility from out-of-state sources. 
As stated by the Governors of Vermont, Maine and Texas in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in April, 1998, `If the facility opens without a Compact in place, Texas will be subject to accepting waste from around the country, and Maine and Vermont will not be guaranteed any storage space at the facility.' Under the Compact, there is a controlled process for transporting and disposing of the waste at the facility. Without the Compact, that process evaporates. 
This arrangement is not only the best environmental solution to store waste from our three states, it is also the best economic solution. Maine and Vermont together produce a fraction of what is generated in Texas, but by entering into this Compact we will share the cost of building the facility. 
Right now, Vermont pays approximately $400 per cubic foot to dispose of our waste. Disposal at the Texas facility will cost only about $200 per cubic foot. If the Compact is not approved, it is the ratepayers of Vermont, Texas and Maine who will have to pay the extra cost of disposal. 
Finally, building the facility does not end Vermont's obligation to the safety of this site. We have a long-term commitment to the site, from ensuring that the facility meets all of the federal construction and operating regulations to making sure the waste is transported properly to the site and that the surrounding area is rigorously monitored. Vermont will not send its waste to Texas and then close its eyes to the rest of the process. 
I can assure you that Vermont will not send nuclear waste to Texas and then close its eyes to the rest of the process. We are just not going to do that. We are not a State that would do that. 
Some might want to say it would be nice if we had no more nuclear waste. Unfortunately, we will. We will continue to have it. And we will still have to dispose of it. 
I think we all recognize that there was no perfect solution for dealing with low-level nuclear waste. 
But as long as we are generating power from nuclear facilities and as long as our research universities, hospitals and laboratories use nuclear materials, we are going to have to dispose of the waste. 
We cannot continue to ignore the need to safely store nuclear waste. To do so would be to ignore the growing environmental problem of storing this waste at inadequate, temporary sites in Vermont, Maine and Texas. 
Instead, we need to make a commitment to developing and building the safest facility for long-term storage of waste. That is what our States have done, and Congress should not stand in their way. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords today in introducing the Rural Opportunity Communities Act of 1998. This bill will greatly enhance the Empowerment Zone program by providing incentives to reward well performing Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. The bill will also offer communities which face significant economic problems, but do not fit the strict definitions of the Empowerment Zone program with an alternative built on the same long-term, comprehensive, community-based planning. 
In 1995 the first round of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities were designated. Those communities have well demonstrated the potential of the program to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods and poverty stricken rural areas. In Burlington's Old North End, Vermont's only Enterprise Community, the benefits of this program have been tremendous. What was once a decaying section of the city is now a vital neighborhood. Equally important, the `New North End' has become an integral part of the city through the network of organizations and community members that pulled together to develop a plan to revitalize the area. 
A new round of Empowerment Zone awards will allow additional communities to benefit from the program. This bill further enhances the Empowerment Zone program by recognizing those communities which have made the most progress in implementing their ten year plans and improving their neighborhoods. These model Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will be eligible to compete for special incentive grants so that the successful programs they have initiated can continue to flourish. The success of well-performing Enterprise Communities will also be recognized by giving them additional points on their applications for empowerment zone status. 
FInally, the bill establishes a special demonstration program, the Rural Opportunity Communities. This demonstration is designed to test the Empowerment Zone model of long-term, community based planning, with communities which are facing economic problems different from those defined by the Empowerment Zone program. Among other factors, the ROC demonstration will recognize the very real problem of under-employment, a significant problem in Vermont. The northeastern corner of Vermont, known as the Northeast Kingdom, is regularly responsible for one of the highest unemployment rates in the state. This is a very rural area where many families also hold down multiple jobs to make ends meet. 
Last year I worked to bring together a group of economic development organizations and local officials to take a broader look at the problems facing the region, and work to find a common approach to addressing those problems. Since that time this group, known as the Northeast Kingdom Enterprise Collaborative, has continued to grow and has begun to lay the groundwork for a long-term plan for the three-county area. The ROC demonstration will offer a perfect opportunity for areas like the Northeast Kingdom, that are interested in pursuing this Empowerment Zone model, to gain access to the resources they need.

 Mr. LEAHY. The role of women in the production and development of the global agriculture system has historically been largely overlooked. Women, however, are an indispensable part of the system, producing 65% of the world's food supply. They have historically held the primary burden for the production, acquisition, and preparation of food for their households. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, in Africa women produce up to 80% of the total food supply. 
Women contribute a great deal to the agricultural backbone upon which we all rely, and yet they too often go without praise or thanks. I want to recognize the invaluable role that women play in feeding the world. 
In the last few years, several important steps have been taken to assure that women working in agriculture around the world are given the recognition they deserve. In 1994, the First International Conference on Women in Agriculture was held in Melbourne, Australia. It was designed as a forum for women involved in agriculture to come together and share their experiences while learning more about successful farming and agri-business techniques. This conference was one of the first attempts to call attention to the specific roles women play in the agricultural world. 
The following year, the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women was held in Beijing, China. It was at this international conference that a decision was made to call on the world's governments to finally measure and value uncompensated work by women, including agricultural labor, in their respective country's official statistics. 
In 1997, President Clinton proclaimed October 15 as International Rural Women's Day. In doing so, he again brought to the world's attention that rural women comprise more than one-quarter of the world's population and form the basis of much of the world's agricultural economy. These important events provide a substantial foundation that we must continue to build upon. 
The Second International Conference for Women in Agriculture, recently held here in our nation's capitol, continued to capitalize upon the efforts of the past by focusing on the status of women and their agricultural contributions to the world. Women from all parts of world, including my home state of Vermont, gathered to discuss and learn about the major concerns of women in agriculture. 
Ten Vermonters, including farmers and representatives from the Vermont Department of Agriculture and the Vermont State Farm Bureau, attended the conference. Linda Aines, Beverly Bishop, Diane Bothfeld, Nancy Bruce, Kate Duesterberg, Bunny Flint, Debra Heleba, Sandra Holt, Martha Izzi, Lindsey Ketchel, Daphne Makinson, Kristin Mason, and Mary Peabody participated in the conference and contributed to the events with an extremely well-received exhibit of photographs and goods produced by Vermont women, including cheese and maple syrup. These women joined with representatives from throughout the country and the world to discuss agriculture issues while celebrating their roles as food producers. Issues ranged from protection from banned chemicals and hazardous equipment to biotechnology, some of the most debated and contentious agriculture issues facing our world today. 
We need to continue to nurture the seed of promise and hope planted by the Women in Agriculture Conference. At the conclusion of the conference a caucus of women representatives, including Vermont's, presented a resolution declaring that the role and rights of women in agriculture should be respected and supported by the nations and societies they serve and that they be valued and consulted as equal partners in the production and trade of agricultural goods around the world. We must not ignore this resolution and the movement it represents. Mr. President, I ask that the text of resolution be placed in the Record after my remarks. 
Women involved in agriculture around the globe deserve our appreciation and respect and have gone far too long without it. Conferences such as the one held in Washington bring attention to the plight of women in agriculture while aiding the communication between women in agriculture in the advanced world and women in the developing one. 
A great deal more work needs to be done, however, before the dreams and ambitions of women involved in agriculture everywhere are realized. I implore all the members of Congress to join me in acknowledging our debts to the women of the agricultural world, celebrate their attempts to bring their work to the attention of the world, and help to make their ambitions and goals reality.

Mr. LEAHY. I concur with the statement of the Chairman of the Committee. The bill affects no pending or decided cases except to the extent that courts have exempted major league baseball clubs from the antitrust laws in their dealings with major league players. In fact, Section 3 of the legislation makes clear that the law is unchanged with regard to issues such as relocation. The bill has no impact on the recent decisions in federal and state courts in Florida, Pennsylvania and Minnesota concerning baseball's status under the antitrust laws.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine Marine Officer, General Butch Neal, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, who will soon retire from active duty. 
General Neal's long and distinguished career began more than thirty years ago following his graduation from Northeastern University when he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Following the completion of The Basic School at Quantico, Butch was trained as an artillery officer and was assigned to duty in the Republic of Vietnam where he served tours as a Forward Observer and as an Advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Corps. 
While serving in Vietnam, he was wounded and received the Purple Heart. He was also awarded the Silver Star Medal on two occasions for his heroism as well as the Bronze Star Medal with Combat `V' device. 
General Neal distinguished himself over the years as one of the Marine Corps' finest commanding officers. Whether as a battery commander, artillery battalion commander, Deputy Marine Expeditionary Force Commander or Commanding General of the 2nd Marine Division, his reputation as an uncommonly gifted leader of Marines has grown with each billet he held. In the joint arena, he served with distinction as the Commanding General, Joint Task Force for Operation GITMO, the humanitarian relief effort for Haitian immigrants in Cuba and as the Deputy Commander in Chief/Chief of Staff for U.S. Central Command. 
Day after day, year after year he demonstrated the rare quality of balancing difficult and often dangerous responsibilities with a keen concern for the welfare of his Marines. Butch has been a superb staff officer. Most Americans remember him from his no-nonsense daily briefings during the Persian Gulf War, but he also distinguished himself in personnel management as well as in operational planning. 
This unique combination of leadership and administrative skills carried him to the very highest levels of the Marine Corps. His impeccable character and strong moral fiber make him a leader among the very best of our nation's military commanders. Yet what stands out most to me when I think of this fine officer is his simplicity and unassuming nature. 
Despite all the accolades and all the honors, he remains a simple man from Massachusetts. I got to know him and his wife Kathy because they attend the same church as my wife Marcelle and I. He is a hard working New Englander who with love of God, country and Corps dedicated a lifetime in service to our nation. Too often we do not thank the Butch Neals of the world, those who choose a lifetime of service and sacrifice so that the rest of us can live safe and free. 
Butch, we are grateful for the service you have rendered as a Marine, as well as the sacrifices made by both you and your family. I wish Butch, his wife Kathy and their children Andrew, Amy and Erin much health and happiness in the years ahead. Our country is better for the many contributions he has given us.

Mr. President, I note this was primarily a clarification so the Department of Defense and Department of State could be saying the same thing in this area. I understand the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii may want to discuss it further between now and conference. I will be a conferee on that, and will be happy to do so.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is adopting the Kyl-Leahy substitute amendment to S. 512, the `Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act.' 
Protecting the privacy of our personal information is a challenge, especially in this information age. Every time we obtain or use a credit card, place a toll-free phone call, surf the Internet, get a driver's license or are featured in Who's Who, we are leaving virtual pieces of ourselves in the form of personal information, which can be used without our consent or even our knowledge. Too frequently, criminals are getting hold of this information and using the personal information of innocent individuals to carry out other crimes. Indeed, U.S. News & World Report has called identity theft `a crime of the 90's'. 
The consequences for the victims of identity theft can be severe. They can have their credit ratings ruined and be unable to get credit cards, student loans, or mortgages. They can be hounded by creditors or collection agencies to repay debts they never incurred, but were obtained in their name, at their address, with their social security number or driver's license number. It can take months or even years, and agonizing effort, to clear their good names and correct their credit histories. I understand that, in some instances, victims of identity theft have even been arrested for crimes they never committed when the actual perpetrators provided law enforcement officials with assumed names. 
The new legislation provides important remedies for victims of identity theft. Specifically, it makes clear that these victims are entitled to restitution, including payment for any costs and attorney's fees in clearing up their credit histories and having to engage in any civil or administrative proceedings to satisfy debts, liens or other obligations resulting from a defendant's theft of their identity. In addition, the bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to keep track of consumer complaints of identity theft and provide information to victims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath. 
This is an important bill on an issue that has caused harm to many Americans. It has come a long way from its original formulation, which would have made it an offense, subject to 15 years' imprisonment, to possess `with intent to deceive' identity information issued to another person. I was concerned that the scope of the proposed offense in the bill as introduced would have resulted in the federalization of innumerable state and local offenses, such as the status offenses of underage teenagers using fake ID cards to gain entrance to bars or to buy cigarettes, or even the use of a borrowed ID card without any illegal purpose. This problem, and others, were addressed in the Kyl-Leahy substitute that was reported out of the Committee and further refined in the substitute amendment the Senate considers today. 
Since Committee consideration of this bill, we have continued to consult with the Department of Justice to improve the bill in several ways. Most significantly, the Kyl-Leahy substitute amendment appropriately limits the scope of the new offense governing the illegal transfer or use of another person's `means of identification' to exclude `possession.' This change ensures that the bill does not inadvertently subject innocuous conduct to the risk of serious federal criminal liability. For example, with this change, the bill would no longer raise the possibility of criminalizing the mere possession of another person's name in an address book or Rolodex, when coupled with some sort of bad intent. 
At the same time, the substitute restores the nuanced penalty structure of section 1028, so that it continues to treat most other possessory offenses involving identification documents and document-making implements as misdemeanors. Thus, in the substitute, the use or transfer of 1 or more means of identification that results in the perpetrator receiving anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more over a 1-year period, would carry a penalty of a fine or up to 15 years' imprisonment, or both. The use or transfer of another person's means of identification that does not satisfy those monetary and time period requirements, would carry a penalty of a fine and up to three years' imprisonment, or both. 
Finally, again with the support of the Department of Justice, we specified the forfeiture procedure to be used in connection with offenses under section 1028. The bill as reported created a forfeiture penalty for these offenses; the addition of a procedure simply clarifies how that penalty is to be enforced. 
I am glad that Senator Kyl and I were able to join forces to craft legislation that both punishes the perpetrators of identity theft and helps the victims of this crime.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I am pleased that after many months of debate, the Senate has finally passed S. 1360 today. This bill, `The Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1998,' will ensure that free trade and tourism continue to flourish along our nation's borders. It will preserve the status quo for our friendly neighbors to the north and will provide us with the necessary time to study and develop an appropriate way to monitor our nation's borders and sea ports. 
I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of S. 1360 and have spoken repeatedly about the need for this remedy. Without this type of legislation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service might be obligated to begin implementing an enormously expensive automated entry-exit monitoring system at all of our nation's borders this fall without having the opportunity to study the situation and develop a workable system. The passage of this legislation means the Attorney General will now have one year to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of various means of tracking the entry and exit of immigrants crossing our country's land borders. 
Over the past year, I have worked hard to ensure that this legislation does not negatively impact the thousands of people and the millions of dollars of trade which cross our borders each day. This bill preserves the integrity of our open border with Canada and ensures that no additional burden is placed upon Canadians who plan to shop or travel in the United States. Mexican nationals will also have additional time under this bill to acquire new border crossing cards and will be able to obtain border crossing cards for their children under age 15 at a reduced cost. Vermonters and others who cross our nation's land borders on a daily basis to work or visit with family or friends in Canada and Mexico should be able to continue to do so without additional border delays. 
The Border Improvement Act also takes a more thoughtful approach to modifying U.S. immigration policies than that contained in section 110 of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (`IIRIRA'). By requiring an automated system for monitoring the entry and exit of `all aliens', section 110 would subject Canadians, and others who are not currently required to show documentation, to unprecedented border checks at U.S. points of entry. This sort of tracking system would be enormously costly to implement along the borders, especially since there is no current infrastructure in place to track the departure of individuals leaving the United States at our land borders or sea ports. Section 110, as currently worded, would also lead to excessive and costly traffic delays for those living and working near the borders. That is why I am so pleased that we were able to pass this legislation today to remedy this situation. 
Instead of requiring the INS to implement such a costly and burdensome border tracking system with little forethought, S. 1360 mandates that the Attorney General conduct a study over the next year of the feasibility of various automated monitoring systems. This study will include an assessment of the potential costs and impact of any new automated monitoring system on trade and travelers along the country's land borders and seaports. An entry-exit monitoring system at our nation's airports will still be implemented within the next two years. 
The Border Improvement Act also authorizes additional funds to ensure that adequate staffing and the newest equipment is available for INS and Customs agents along both borders. S. 1360 authorizes nearly $120 million in fiscal year 1999 for INS enforcement and inspection equipment and personnel, and an additional $160 million for the U.S. Customs Service to acquire similar equipment and hire additional agents. The Customs Service is authorized to hire 535 inspectors and 60 special agents along the Southwest border and 375 inspectors along the Northern border. The INS is authorized to hire 535 and 375 inspectors for the Southwest and Northern border, respectively, under this bill. These additional resources will help these agencies in their investigations of drug and alien smuggling and should reduce traffic waiting times along the borders. 
Overall, the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1998 is a sensible means of correcting the problematic language in section 110 of the IIRIRA while ensuring better tracking of aliens who overstay their visas.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this summer we are being treated to an exceptional season of baseball, from the record breaking pace of the New York Yankees and the resurgence of the Boston Red Sox, to a number of inspiring individual achievements, including the perfect game of David Wells and the home run displays of McGwire, Griffey and Sosa. Such are the exploits that childhood memories are made of--and which we all thought could be counted on, that is until the summer of 1994. 
Now finally, after years of turmoil, major league baseball is just beginning to emerge from the slump it inflicted upon itself, by returning to that which makes the game great--the game and the players on the field. And, last weekend, Larry Doby and others at long last were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. These are steps in the right direction. 
Today, the Senate will give baseball another nudge in the right direction by passing S. 53, the `Curt Flood Act of 1998.' Murray Chass, a gifted reporter writing for The New York Times noted that on this issue we have finally `moved into scoring position with a bill that would alter the antitrust exemption Major League Baseball has enjoyed since 1922.' 
I am gratified that 76 years after an aberrant Supreme Court decision, we are finally making it clear that with respect to the antitrust laws, major league baseball teams are no different than teams in any other professional sport. For years, baseball was the only business or sport, of which I am aware, that claimed an exemption from antitrust laws, without any regulation in lieu of those laws. The Supreme Court refused to undue its mistake with respect to major league baseball made in the 1922 case of Federal Baseball. Finally, in the most well-known case on the issue, Flood v. Kuhn, the Court reaffirmed the Federal Baseball case on the basis of the legal principle of stare decisis while specifically finding that professional baseball is indeed an activity of interstate commerce, and thereby rejecting the legal basis for the Federal Baseball case. 
Mr. President, as a result of that and subsequent decisions, and with the end of the major league reserve clause as the result of an arbitrator's ruling in 1976, there has been a growing debate as to the continued vitality, if any, of any antitrust exemption for baseball. It is for precisely this reason that this bill is limited in its scope to employment relations between major league owners and major league players. That is what is at the heart of turmoil in baseball and what is at the heart of the breach of trust with the fans that marked the cancellation of the 1994 World Series. At least we can take this small step toward ensuring the continuity of the game and restoring public confidence in it. 
When David Cone testified at our hearing three years ago, he posed a most perceptive question. He asked: If baseball were coming to Congress to ask us to provide a statutory antitrust exemption, would such a bill be passed? The answer to that question is a resounding no. Nor should the owners, sitting at the negotiating table in a labor dispute, think that their anticompetitive behavior cannot be challenged. That is an advantage enjoyed by no other group of employers. 
The certainty provided by this bill will level the playing field, making labor disruptions less likely in the future. The real beneficiaries will be the fans. They deserve it. 
Mr. President, I just wanted to comment briefly on a couple of changes made in the substitute from the bill as reported by the Committee. First, the changes in the language in subsection (a) are not intended to limit in any way the rights of players at the major league level as they would be construed under the language of the bill as reported by the Judiciary Committee last July. The additional language was added to ensure that a minor league player, or someone who had played at the major league level and returned to the minor leagues, cannot use subsection (a), concerned with play at the major league level, to attack what is really a minor league employment issue only. Alternatively, neither can the major leagues use the wording of subsection (a) and that of subsection (d) to subvert the purpose of subsection (a) merely by linking a major league practice with a minor league practice. That linkage itself may be an antitrust violation and be actionable under this Act. It cannot be used as a subterfuge by which to subject players at the major league level to acts, practices or agreements that teams or owners in other sports could not subject athletes to. 
Finally, the practices set forth in subsection (b) are not intended to be affected by this Act. While this is true, it should be remembered that although the pure entrepreneurial decisions in this area are unaffected by the Act, if those decisions are made in such a way as to implicate employment of major league players at the major league level, once again, those actions may be actionable under subsection (a). More importantly, we are making no findings as to how, under labor laws, those issues are to be treated. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank all those involved in this undertaking: Chairman Hatch, of course, without whose unfailing efforts this result would not be possible; our fellow cosponsors, Senators Thurmond and Moynihan, and other members of our Committee; and John Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, for making this bill a priority. And I want to commend the interested parties for working to find a solution they can all support. Not only have they done a service to the fans, but they may find, on reflection, that they have done a service to themselves by working together for the good of the game. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not comment on the man for whom this legislation is named, Curt Flood. He was a superb athlete and a courageous man who sacrificed his career for perhaps a more lasting baseball legacy. When others refused, he stood up and said no to a system that he thought un-American as it bound one man to another for his professional career without choice and without a voice in his future. 
I am sad that he did not live long enough to see this day. In deference to his memory and in the interests of every fan of this great game, I hope that Congress will act quickly on this bill. I am delighted that we are moving forward today and that we are finally able to enjoy the game once again.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, much has been said on the Senate and the House floor about John Gibson and Jacob `J.J.' Chestnut, two police officers on the Capitol Police Force. And much more will be said. I add my words of praise and appreciation to both of them. 
I knew both these police officers. Officer Chestnut--J.J: would see us come through the Senate at several different times, and he would tell me a member of my family has already gone through because he had seen them, or conversely, if they came through he would tell them where I was. 
Detective Gibson traveled with many of us at different occasions. He even came to one, I believe, with the `Singing Senators' from the other side of the aisle. He was the man who at events where Senators would gather, would be there because he would recognize not only the Senators, but their spouses; would wave them on through, would greet them, would make them know they were among friends. We always knew we were. 
Mr. President, I have been a Senator now for nearly 24 years. I walk into this building every day that we are in session, many when we are not. I have gotten to know many of the police officers, and so many others, the hundreds of people that make this body run, make this Capitol run. 
This truly is a death in the family. 
Even if I had not known the officers as I did, I would feel that way. But knowing them in some ways makes it even sadder, more poignant, more difficult. 
I love the Senate and I love the symbol of democracy that our Capitol holds to the public. To see this terrible, terrible thing happen in something that means so much to all of us, it is almost impossible to describe my feelings. 
My wife and I had flown to Vermont last Friday. We got to my office in Burlington and were there only a matter of minutes and heard the news. Much of the rest of the evening was a blur, just sitting in our farmhouse watching the news and not believing it. 
Probably the greatest tribute to two brave police officers was the fact that this Capitol, this symbol of democracy not only to our own Nation of a quarter of a billion people but to the rest of the world, this Capitol was open almost immediately thereafter. 
There is no way we could bring these officers back. It is a tragedy that will be felt by their spouses and their children, in one case, grandchildren, for the rest of their lives. No matter what we do as Members of the Senate or the House, we cannot bring them back to their families. We can only offer our profound sympathy to their families. It is a sympathy that is felt deeply by every single Member of the Congress, Republican or Democrat. It makes no difference whether they have been here a long time or a short time. Our hearts go out as human beings to the families of these officers. 
What we have done in immediately reopening the Capitol, in saying to the public today they can walk in here at any time as they do in the galleries today, we are saying to those officers that your deaths were not in vain. Think, Mr. President, what a different country this would be if somehow this Capitol, this symbol of democracy, was closed down. Think what it would be like if the public, not only Americans but those visiting from around the world, think what it would be like if they could not come into this Capitol, as I did when I was a law student here in Washington or when I first came here with my parents as a teenager. If we could not be here, the public could not come in and see us debate great matters and tiny matters, they could not see that. 
Mr. President, at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, I remember so many who came here and met with all of us and asked, `How does your democracy work,' and they told me--I heard this over and over again--that they would see the picture of our Capitol when they came to Washington, that was the thing they recognized before anything else. They said they saw it sitting up here. 
I have been coming to this Capitol Building as a Senator for 24 years. I feel a thrill every time I come up here. I hope I always will because I know it represents democracy. These two brave officers, just like the hundreds of other men and women who guard these Halls, they keep it open. Let's hope they always will. Let us hope that we always have the courage to do that. Then the lives that every one of us would pray we could bring to the family, those lives would not be lost in vain. 
Like some others in this body, I had the privilege to serve in law enforcement for years before coming here. I know how all of us felt in law enforcement at that time if one of our own was cut down. I think if you have not served in law enforcement it is almost impossible to explain to the American public how other law enforcement officials feel when they lose one of their own. I know how the men and women in the police force here on Capitol Hill feel, but also how they feel all over the Nation. This is a loss. This is a family, a fraternity, a sorority. It is something that binds all law enforcement people together. 
I am joined with every single person who works on Capitol Hill in an expression of appreciation to them and to everybody who responded--all the police officers responded, medical personnel responded. I will take just 1 minute more to express my personal appreciation to Senator Bill Frist for what he did. I spoke with Senator Frist yesterday and told him how much his actions meant to me, to my wife, who is a registered nurse. She knows when something like this happens, if you are a medical personnel, you respond. But he responded not only with his great skill as a cardiac surgeon, he responded when there was gunfire erupting only moments before and there might have been more, with no thought to his safety, but thinking of only those who may have been injured. 
Mr. President, it is a sad day. Let us say also it is a proud day to our country because this symbol of democracy will not be closed down by the actions of one deranged American, any more than it was in the 1980s when the bomb went off outside this Chamber at night just minutes after we recessed. I remember so well the next morning, every single one of us was in our seats. We were here to show we wouldn't stay home. And we will be here today, as will the President and the Vice President, all of the House and Senate leadership, and the Members, to show nothing closes us down. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Friday, July 24, I introduced legislation along with Senators Ashcroft, Burns, and Abraham to repeal the legal mandate for personal identification codes for each patient that would be part of a national medical records system. 
Our legislation, S. 2352, the Patient Privacy Rights Act, would repeal the unique medical identifiers requirement of the Health Insurance Portability Law of 1996 (HIPAA). This law directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a system to use personal identifying codes as part of a system for electronically transmitting health information to aid implementation of the health insurance portability law. The unique health identifiers would be codes, numbers or other methods of uniquely identifying each patient that his or her doctors would be required to use throughout that person's lifetime. Hearings on the emerging system were launched in Chicago this week by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics. 
I believe it is irresponsible to expose patients to this massive new erosion of their privacy. The impetus to computerize medical records for the sake of efficiency cannot be allowed to overrun our basic privacy. People deserve the assurance that their medical histories will not be the subject of public curiosity, commercial advantage or harmful disclosure. This computerization of medical information has raised the stakes in privacy protection. Congress created this threat. Now Congress needs to just say no to the idea of a cradle-to-grave medical dossier. 
Health care computerization not only is inevitable, it can be a useful tool to improve health care. But trusting our medical records to this rapidly developing technology will only be supported by the American people if they are assured that their medical privacy is protected. Privacy is not the only victim here. Without privacy protections, many will be discouraged from seeking help or taking advantage of the access we are working so hard to protect in this very same law.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long been an advocate for legislation that ensures that existing laws keep pace with developing technology. It is for this reason that I have sponsored and supported over the past few years a host of bills to bring us into the 21st Century. These bills have included the National Information Infrastructure (NII) Protection Act of 1995; the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997; the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaty Implementation Act of 1997; the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998; and legislation that passed the Senate on June 26, 1998, to authorize the comprehensive independent study of the effects on trademark and intellectual property rights holders of adding new generic top-level domains and related dispute resolution procedures. 
This same impetus underlies my support of legislation to ensure our nation's gambling laws keep pace with developing technology, particularly the Internet. The Department of Justice has noted that `the Internet may have diminished the effectiveness of current gambling statutes, in part because existing laws may relate only to sports betting and not the type of interactive gambling (e.g., poker) that the Internet makes possible.' Vermonters have spoken very clearly that they do not want certain types of gambling permitted in the state, and they do not want current laws to be rendered obsolete by the Internet. I believe, therefore, that there is considerable value in updating our Federal gambling statutes, and I have been pleased to work with Senator Kyl on his legislation intended to accomplish that goal, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1998. 
The legislation has been improved since it eas reported out of committee. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the bill on October 23, 1997. Although I voted in favor of the legislation at that time, I noted that I had several concerns about the bill and that I wished to work with Senator Kyl and others to address these concerns. 
The bill as originally drafted might have inadvertently outlawed the tri-state lottery that is run by the states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Although Vermonters have clearly indicated that they do not want many other forms of gambling, they do want to maintain this tri-state lottery, which has been in operation since 1985. 
The legislation now under consideration states that the prohibitions against Internet gambling in the bill shall not apply to any otherwise lawful bet or wager that is placed, received, or otherwise made for a multi-state lottery operated jointly between two or more States in conjunction with State lotteries, if the lottery or activity is expressly authorized and licensed or regulated under Federal or applicable State law. 
I would like to thank the office of Vermont's Attorney General for working with Senator Kyl and me to craft this language to ensure that Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine's tri-state lottery remains a permissible activity under this bill. 
As originally introduced, the bill contained Sense of the Senate language that the Federal Government should have extraterritorial jurisdiction over the transmission to or receipt from the United States of bets or wagers, information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, and any communication that entitles the transmitter or recipient to the opportunity to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers. 
That provision was changed, and when the bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee, the Sense of the Senate provision was replaced with a requirement that not later than six months after the date of enactment, certain Administration officials would be required to commence negotiations with foreign countries in order to conclude international agreements that would enable the United States to enforce the bill. 
I was concerned about the constitutionality of this new requirement mandating that the Executive Branch undertake international negotiations, particularly in light of the decision of the 1993 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Earth Island Institute versus Christopher. The court in this case held unconstitutional a portion of a statute which directed the Secretary of State to initiate international negotiations regarding the protection and conservation of a certain species of sea turtles. 
Specifically, the court held this type of directive to intrude upon the conduct of foreign relations by the Executive Branch on the grounds that the `Constitution commits the power to make treaties to the President.' 
The Department of Justice also recommended the deletion of this section. As Anthony Sutin, Acting Assistant Attorney General, stated in his May 28, 1998, letter to me on this legislation:  
If we request that foreign countries investigate, on our behalf, conduct that is legal in the foreign state, we must be prepared to receive and act upon foreign requests for assistance when the conduct complained of is legal, or even constitutionally protected, in the United States. 
For example, if we ask a foreign country to investigate an activity (e.g., gambling) that is legal in the foreign state, that country may, for example, ask us to investigate constitutionally protected speech originating on computers based in the United States (e.g., that arguably violates that nation's `hate speech' laws). Considering all of the challenges facing law enforcement in the information age, we believe that current efforts should focus on conduct which either is, or should be, universally condemned. 
Senator Kyl agreed to my request that this section of the bill be deleted, and I believe that the legislation is considerably improved for that reason. 
Another constitutional concern was raised by earlier versions of the bill that stated that `information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager'--`(A) means information that is intended by the sender or recipient to be used by a person engaged in the business of betting or wagering to accept or place a bet or wager; (B) includes any information that invites the information described in subparagraph (A) to be transmitted;' and then included some exceptions. 
I was concerned, as was the Department of Justice, that this language was vague and might raise constitutional concerns as it might be construed to apply to persons who do not have the intent to participate in or assist illegal gambling transactions. Similarly, these earlier versions of the legislation could have been interpreted to prohibit Internet advertising of activities that are entirely legal. This appeared to be an unintentional result of the earlier versions, but one that raised serious constitutional issues. 
The Department of Justice suggested deleting subsection (B) altogether, and inserting the phrase `in violation of state or Federal law' at the end of subsection (A). The addition of this latter phrase would ensure that transmission of information assisting in the placing of legal bets or wagers would not be criminalized by this legislation. Senator Kyl agreed to delete subsection (B), but he did not add the phrase `in violation of state or Federal law' at the end of subsection (A). I hope this later suggestion by the Department of Justice is accepted as the legislation moves through the legislative process. 
In the bill as originally introduced, an individual bettor who was found guilty of Internet gambling would have been subject to a penalty of $5,000, one year of prison or both. I thought that penalty was extreme. If someone places a $1 bingo bet over the Internet, that might not be activity we want to encourage, but I also do not think we need to lock that individual up in prison and charge him or her 5,000 times that amount in penalties. I expressed my view to Senator Kyl, and as a result he softened the penalty for individual bettors. 
As the bill currently reads, the individual bettor would be subject to (A) fines not more than the greater of (i) three times the greater of the total amount that the individual is found to have wagered or received or (ii) $500; (B) 3 months prison; or (C) both. I hope that prosecutors and judges will use proper discretion when determining, even under this more reasonable regime, whether to expend federal resources prosecuting and imprisoning individuals who place de minimis bets. 
The bill as introduced criminalized the activities of those persons engaged in the `business of betting or wagering,' but the bill did not define what constituted a `business of betting or wagering.' I believe that it is important that if Congress is going to make certain activities illegal, and subject the executor of that activity to hefty monetary fines and imprisonment, we need to be very clear about what activity, exactly, we are making illegal. 
The version of the bill that is now under consideration makes it unlawful for a person engaged in a gambling business for betting or wagering to use the Internet or any other interactive computer service. The bill defines the term `gambling business' as a gambling business that involves one or more persons who conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs or owns all or part of such business and has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of 10 days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 or more during any 24-hour period. 
Although I preferred to use the definition of an `illegal gambling business' found in 18 U.S.C. 1955, I believe the bill as it currently reads is an improvement from the original version, and I appreciate Senator Kyl's willingness to work with me on this issue. 
In addition, language was inserted into the bill which dictates special rules that would apply in any proceeding instituted under the bill in which application is made for a temporary restraining order or an injunction against an interactive computer service. I was not party to the negotiations on this language, nor am I convinced that this language is necessary. Courts, when determining the appropriateness of equitable relief, generally consider factors such as the significance of the threat of irreparable harm to a plaintiff if the injunction is not granted; the state of the balance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction would inflict on the defendant; the probability that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; and the public interest. It has not, to date, been demonstrated to me why these traditional standards are not adequate to address situations involving interactive computer services, and I fear that this new language in the bill might cause more mischief than it would cure. I hope that we can continue to work on this language as the bill advances through the legislative process. 
Finally, the Senate has accepted an amendment by Senator Bryan to include a provision addressing Internet games known as `sports fantasy leagues'. I understand that many of the companies that offer these sports fantasy league games are concerned about the wording of this provision. I also understand that they will be seeking refinements in the language as we move through the legislative process, and I look forward to working with them as well as Senator Bryan and Senator Kyl in that regard.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are maybe thirty-five legislative days left this Congress. We have passed six out of thirteen appropriations--and those have been the easier ones. Now--we are facing the appropriations bills that are bogged down with legislative riders and have already invoked Presidential veto threats. 
The Transportation Appropriations bill though is fairly clean and we might be able to pass it tonight. Unfortunately, the temptation to put environmental riders on this bill could not be resisted. Section 342 of this bill will overturn eighteen years of national environmental policy, open some of the most pristine wilderness in the country to helicopter landings. 
Mr. President, I was here when the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act was passed by Congress. I remember the careful balance that was crafted to pass this landmark legislation. The question of allowing helicopters was raised at that time and the answer we came up with was to not allow them in wilderness areas except for emergency situations. If you look at the legislative history included in the Senate Report for ANILCA it specifically lists what transportation was allowed in wilderness areas and helicopters are not one of them. 
Instead, it directed the Secretary of the Interior to allow airplanes to be used in wilderness areas for traditional activities. Mr. President, I understand why this exception to the national Wilderness Act was made for Alaska and I supported it at the time. But I supported it as part of a larger compromise. One that this language will now undo. 
Two years ago, the Forest Service conducted an Environmental Impact Statement on this same proposal and concluded that helicopters were not airplanes and were not a traditional means of access to the wilderness areas. Obviously, some of my colleagues do not like this conclusion and felt that tacking an environmental rider onto the transportation appropriation bill was the best way to get around it. 
The Interior Department has also objected to this language due to the impact on wildlife in these wilderness areas. Mr. President, I think we all know that a helicopter flying overhead is much louder than a small airplane flying overhead. Helicopters blast the adjacent area with a minimum of 100 decibels or more. 
But this language is not about just sheer noise. It is also about allowing helicopters to hover and land anywhere in these areas--the remote reaches of the Tongass National Forest, the glaciers of Kenai Fjords National Park and even the inlets of Glacier Bay. 
Although it may seem like it now, I am not the only person speaking out against this language. I have over thirty five letters from outfitters, bush pilots and tour guides in Alaska who oppose this language. 
So, Mr. President, I simply ask: What is the rush? Why are we including language in a transportation appropriations bill that rewrites legislation that has been on the books for eighteen years, on which no hearings have been held and that has been recommended for a veto?

Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator not agree with me that one thing we have heard, talking with law enforcement people--not somebody who just looks at this from a theoretical point of view, but law enforcement people--is that the issue of prevention comes up over and over again? The Senator from Delaware, of course, addressed this in his original legislation. It was, as the Senator from Delaware will recall, a matter of some debate, both in the committee and on the floor. As I recall, in some of the conference committees we went to 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock in the morning several times, discussing the issue of prevention. 
I believe the Senator from Delaware will recall, as I do, the number of police officers and police officials who came to us and said stay with prevention programs. 
In many ways, it just makes such great sense. As a former prosecutor, I remember that it was always the prevention programs that worked the best. So I ask the Senator from Delaware, does he not agree with what the President of the National Sheriffs Association says, in an open letter? 
After he speaks of the problems of juvenile crime, the President of the National Sheriffs Association says:  
So what is the answer? We must adopt a three-pronged approach to juvenile violence--prevention, intervention and enforcement. These recent statistics indicate the need for a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes education and community involvement, and addresses the root causes of delinquency. We can no longer afford to focus only on treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. Sheriffs offices, through prevention programs . . . [the letter lists a number of them] can make a difference in the lives of children who still have a choice ahead of them as to whether or not to try drugs, join a gang, steal a car, or otherwise start on the slippery slope of a life of crime. 
Wouldn't the Senator from Delaware agree with the head of the National Sheriffs Association and me and so many others who say keep these prevention programs going, do not take money away from the prevention programs, but accept the fact that they are now beginning to work and work very well? This is not the time to cut them off. This is not the time to change these prevention programs into some kind of a block grant program that would not be aimed at prevention. Would not my friend from Delaware agree with that?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his courtesy earlier. I will be very brief. Any time we speak of juvenile justice, there are, obviously, emotional issues that come up, as there was on this. But I believe the Senate has voted the proper way on the motion of the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire to table the amendment. 
We can all tell horror stories of juvenile justice. One that came to my mind while listening to the lengthy debate this morning is a case when I was State's attorney. A man I knew well died as he was telling me who killed him. It was a juvenile. As he described it, we were in the emergency room and doctors were trying to save his life. 
I was there as the chief law enforcement officer of the county. And heard him tell me who the juvenile was who killed him. So we can all tell terrible stories. 
What I also know, though, from my experience in law enforcement, and from law enforcement experts I have talked with today all over the country, is that prevention is still the best way to stop juvenile crimes. It is almost axiomatic. And we have a good funding method that the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire and the distinguished Senator from South Carolina have put together in this bill, and we should keep with that formula. 
Had this amendment not been tabled, we would have had these juvenile prevention moneys--we would have had 35 percent going to building facilities and information-sharing programs, 45 percent into more judges and probation officers and prosecutors and technology and courts, and so forth. 
The fact is, we are getting a handle on juvenile crime in this country, but we are doing it through prevention programs. All the police officers I have talked with in my State, and all the police officers I have talked with elsewhere, tell me the same thing: Better and more prevention programs to stop juvenile crime. 
Among my duties as a prosecutor was to represent the State in the most active juvenile court in our State. Nearly a third of the juvenile cases in our State went through there. Over and over and over again, I saw the tragedy of juvenile crimes occurring because there had not been prevention programs. We did the right thing in this vote. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I oppose Senator McCain's amendment, originally introduced as S. 1619, to require schools and libraries wired with federal funds to install Internet filtering software. Congress has wisely seen fit to make the Internet widely available to young people throughout the country by subsidizing school and library access to the Internet through `E-rate' discounts. The McCain amendment would undermine the benefits of that access by forcing schools and libraries to use filtering technologies to remove a significant percentage of material available on-line. Internet filtering issues should be discussed and implemented locally, not nationally, and certainly not by piggybacking a filtering bill onto a crime bill and spiriting them to the Senate floor as amendments to an appropriations bill. 
While we can all agree that some material available on the Internet may be unsuitable for certain age groups, there is serious disagreement concerning the best approach to the challenge of protecting our children from exposure to unsuitable material. Fundamentally, this is a decision that should be made at the local level, by families and school boards, librarians and educators in their own communities. Although I share the deep concerns about children's access to obscenity and other harmful materials on the Internet, in the rush to protect children, we should not unnecessarily chill the freedom of expression that occurs on-line. 
The intention of this amendment is good. But good intentions do not always make for the best policy. The primary problem with this amendment is that it usurps local authority on whether to use filtering technologies on computers with Internet access. That's why educators oppose it. The National Education Association and the American Association of School Administrators testified before the Commerce Committee that they opposed making E-rate discounts contingent upon installation of blocking or filtering software. Imposing a top-down mandate requiring schools to install filtering software as a condition for accessing E-rate discounts violates the principle of local control of curricular matters. 
Placing the burden on libraries, schools, and other public institutions to supervise our children's access to information is also counterproductive. Schools have already been forced to comply with extensive congressional and FCC requirements to participate in the E-rate program. Forcing schools to comply with further requirements would strain the already overburdened financial and staff resources of the nation's schools. Although at first blush this requirement does not appear to be overburdensome, given the number of federal requirements with which schools and libraries receiving Federal assistance already must comply, the mandate would require extensive research, installation and implementation. Some of our local schools already have their own systems in place to monitor Internet access. The McCain amendment could force them to scrap these systems and start from scratch. A number of schools and libraries have not yet even received the computers and technologies to gain access to the Internet, and are in the process of applying for E-rate funding to obtain infrastructure, such as wiring and connectivity. Schools may be unable to make the requisite demonstration as to how the filtering software will be implemented if their computers are not yet in place. 
The goal of the federal Internet subsidies is to give our schools, libraries and public institutions open and universal access to the technology and information that will help prepare our children and young adults for the challenges that lie ahead in the next century. By making the subsidy available, we are helping to bridge the gap between wealthier and poorer communities' access to information. The McCain amendment would widen the gap. Wealthier schools that do not receive the subsidy are permitted, within First Amendment bounds, to decide for themselves whether or not to place limits on Internet use. Requiring use restrictions is one more way of telling subsidized schools that they are not trusted to make these decisions for themselves. This is precisely the type of access inequality that the federal E-rate subsidy was designed to cure, not foster. 
Wresting control of educational and informational access from the local communities that are best equipped to make these decisions is not going to solve the problem of inappropriate material on the Internet. Filtering software is one way of restricting the access by minors to such material, but other options exist. Local school boards, administrators, and librarians more familiar with their own systems and culture are the proper people to decide how best to implement any programs restricting access to information. 
I would support efforts to address these issues that allow more flexibility at the local level. Instead of a blanket mandate requiring filtering and blocking technology in all schools and libraries that receive E-rate subsidies, we should have more research into how to combat the problem of minors receiving inappropriate information over the Internet in e-mail messages and in chatrooms. We should encourage schools and libraries to distribute their policies to parents, educators, children, and community members, and to state whether they use any technological means to block access to inappropriate materials. 
There are more sensible approaches. We should alert our communities to the potential problems of inappropriate materials on the Internet, and allow and encourage informed decisionmaking at the local level. That is why I have created a page on my website dedicated to providing guidance to parents and educators on how to protect children from inappropriate material online. But above all, we should support the mission behind the E-rate subsidy: open and universal access to technology and information. 
Our children and our schools need as much support as we can possibly offer to help prepare the next generation to meet the challenges that lie ahead. 
Mr. President, with reference to the amendment offered by Senator Coats, less than three years ago, during the 104th Congress, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to adopt the Communications Decency Act as part of the telecommunications deregulation bill. The CDA, like the current amendment, sought to criminalize the transmission of constitutionally protected speech over the Internet. I opposed the CDA from the start as fatally flawed and flagrantly unconstitutional. I predicted that the CDA would not pass constitutional muster and, along with Senator Feingold, I introduced a bill to repeal the CDA so that we would not have to wait for the Supreme Court to fix our mistake. 
We did not fix the mistake and so, as I predicted, the Supreme Court eventually did our work for us. All nine Justices agreed that the CDA was, at least in part, unconstitutional. Justice Stevens, writing for seven members of the Court, called the CDA `patently invalid' and warned that it cast `dark shadow over free speech' and `threaten[ed] to torch a large segment of the Internet community.' 
The Court's decision came as no surprise to me, and it should have come as no surprise to the 84 Senators who supported the legislation. One of the sponsors of the current amendment said in a floor statement last Friday that the Supreme Court should have approved the CDA because the law used the same indecency standard that the Court had previously approved in connection with the dial-a-porn statute. This statement puzzled me because, as I recall, the Court did not approve the indecency standard in the dial-a-porn statute. The Court approved that statute only insofar as it applied to obscene communication, which can be banned totally because it is not protected by the First Amendment. The Court invalidated the dial-a-porn statute as it applied to indecent communication, which does enjoy First Amendment protection. This is precisely the same distinction that the Court drew in the CDA case, where it struck down the restrictions on indecent material, but left the restrictions on obscene material standing. The CDA decision followed the dial-a-porn decision; it did not break new ground in that regard. 
Now here we are, again, taking another stab at censoring constitutionally protected speech on the Internet, again, in the name of protecting children. Of course, we all want to protect children from harm. I prosecuted child abusers as State's Attorney in Vermont, and have worked my entire professional life to protect children from those who would prey on them. But we have a duty to ensure that the means we use to protect our children do not do more harm than good. As the Supreme Court made clear when it struck down the CDA, laws that prohibit protected speech do not become constitutional merely because they were enacted for the important purpose of protecting children. 
The amendment makes a valiant effort to address many of the Supreme Court's technical objections to the CDA. But while it is more narrowly drawn, it still raises substantial constitutional questions. The core holding of the CDA case was that `the vast democratic fora of the Internet' deserves the highest level of protection from government intrusion--the highest level of First Amendment scrutiny. Courts will assess the constitutionality of laws that regulate speech over the Internet by the same demanding standards that have traditionally applied to laws affecting the press. 
The current amendment does not meet those standards. For one thing, it calls for a single, national definition of the `harmful to minors' standard, which until now has always been defined at the State or local community level. We should not forget the Supreme Court's admonition in Miller versus California that: `our Nation is simply too big and too diverse . . . to reasonably expect that such standards could be articulated for all 50 States in a single formulation. . . . It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City.' 
In addition, the way in which the amendment defines `material that is harmful to minors' is not altogether consistent with prior law. The sponsor says that the definition was taken `word for word' from the Ginsberg case, but the fact is that several important terms were altered or omitted. This could be confusing, and it could well have the unintended consequence of limiting the meaning of state `harmful to minors' laws. 
The strict liability provisions of the amendment are another matter of concern. The amendment imposes criminal liability and authorizes severe criminal and civil sanctions on anyone who fails to take affirmative steps to restrict access of certain materials by minors. There is no requirement that the person acted knowingly, willfully, or even with criminal intent. The strict liability imposed by the amendment would chill content on the Web. Also, since this amendment only applies to the Web, I am concerned that if it becomes law it would pressure Internet content providers and users to use or develop other protocols with which they would be able to exercise their First Amendment rights unfettered by the threat of strict liability criminal prosecution. 
There are other problems with the scope of the amendment. It does not define who would be covered by the crucial phrase `engaged in the business of the commercial distribution of material.' Would the amendment cover companies that offer free Web sites, but charge for their off-line services? Also, if we restrict coverage to commercial distributions, are we just encouraging people to post the very same obnoxious materials on the Web for free? Is that what we want? 
Further, it is entirely unclear whether the amendment's affirmative defense provision can be used in the civil context, since it states that it is a defense to `prosecution' under the amendment. Would companies that restrict access to their Web sites in accordance with FCC procedures nonetheless be exposed to the stiff civil penalties established by the amendment? 
We can and must do better. There are other more effective and less restrictive solutions--solutions like filtering technology, which empower individual Internet users without reducing the level of discourse over the Web to what would be suitable for a sandbox. This amendment, like its predecessor, places an unacceptably heavy burden on protected speech. We should not run another ambiguous speech regulation up the flagpole and expect the courts to salute. We owe it to the millions of Americans who use the Web not to make the same mistake a second time. 
Finally, I note that the Senate is considering this important measure, including its creation of new federal crimes, as part of an annual appropriations bill. Until recently the Senate had rules and precedent against this kind of legislating on an appropriations bill. Under Republican leadership, that discipline has been lost and we are left to consider significant legislative proposals as amendments to annual appropriations. These matters are far-reaching. They deserve full debate and Senate consideration before good intentions lead the Senate to take another misstep in haste.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I had intended to offer an amendment today to begin monitoring of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and include this information in the Toxic Release Inventory. Congress has a long track record of supporting the public's `right to know' about the nature and volume of toxic chemicals that are being released into the environment from manufacturing facilities in their neighborhoods. The `Toxics Release Inventory' has empowered citizens and communities and is helping local and state environmental agencies to identify the most pressing problems within their neighborhoods. A glaring gap in information from the Inventory is mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that at least 52 tons of mercury are being released to the environment each year, every year, from these plants. When Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, we did not address mercury emissions but instead required EPA to report back to Congress on the sources, impacts and control strategies for mercury. Congress finally received that report last year and now needs to act on it. That is why I introduced the `Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998.' Although I will not offer my mercury right-to-know amendment today, Congress has a responsibility to act on the EPA Mercury Report to Congress. I believe Senator Chafee who is one of the leading proponents of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, agrees with me that steps should be taken to address mercury emissions.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have spoken previously on my concerns about the ongoing threats from mercury pollution to the lands, rivers and lakes of Vermont and the rest of the country. I sponsored a Senate Resolution that called on the Administration to release its long overdue Mercury Study Report to Congress, a report that was mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990. Earlier this year I introduced S. 1915, the `Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998' which, if enacted, would significantly reduce the risks that this powerful neurotoxin poses to the neurological health and development of pregnant women and their fetuses, women of child bearing age, and children. Senators Snowe, Wellstone and Moynihan have joined me in co-sponsoring the legislation. 
The Mercury Study Report to Congress states that 150 tons of mercury are released to the environment every year, year after year. The Study reports that more than one-third of the mercury that is released in the United States each year--52 tons--comes from coal-fired power plants. Mercury is contained in the coal. When coal is burned the mercury is vaporized and is released to the environment. 
Once released to the environment, mercury does not behave like many pollutants. It does not biodegrade, it persists. Mercury does not become less toxic--it transforms chemically into even stronger and more toxic forms such as methyl mercury. Methyl mercury accumulates in fish, and it accumulates in the human beings that eat the fish. Once ingested, methyl mercury is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. It easily penetrates the blood-brain and placental barriers, and it stays in the body for very long periods of time. One of the ways that it is finally excreted from the body is through breast milk. A developing fetal brain and nervous system can be exposed to mercury because the placenta and the blood-brain barriers offer no protection, and once born, the exposure can continue through breast milk. 
There is ample evidence that mercury levels in the environment are increasing. One of the most telling indicators is the trend in mercury fishing advisories. In 1993, 27 states had issued health advisories warning the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish. In 1997, this had grown to 39 states. We are going in the wrong direction. Before we know it we are going to have filled the whole map with these warnings. It is time to reverse this trend. 
While the EPA report does the best job so far in quantifying mercury emissions, many believe that the report understates the actual amount of mercury being released to the environment. Toward the end of obtaining better data on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, EPA has issued notice of its intent to begin collecting information from these facilities on the mercury that they emit. I think that this is an excellent step for EPA to be taking, and I strongly urge the Office of Management and Budget to support this information collection request. It is very much in keeping with the public's `right to know' about the types and amounts of toxic pollutants that are being released, and I strongly urge EPA to disseminate the information widely, including making it available via the Internet. 
Madam President, I would like to state my serious concern about mercury-related report language in the House of Representatives VA/HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill. Among other things, the report language would require that another mercury report be developed. Each of the mercury-related tasks stipulated in the report language would need to be completed before EPA would be allowed to make any regulatory determinations on mercury. 
This report language purely and simply delays efforts to control mercury emissions at the expense of those who are most susceptible to the effects of mercury pollution--pregnant women and their fetuses, women of child bearing age, and young children. 
To put this delay into perspective, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required EPA to study mercury emissions and to report to Congress. EPA completed the report in 1994 and, largely due to highly effective pressure exerted by the coal-fired power industry, the Agency sat on the report for 2 years. It was finally released last December after much effort by this Senator and a number of my colleagues. It is an excellent report, and the years that it spent on the shelf gathering dust did not alter its message. In the meantime, hundreds of tons of toxic mercury emissions continued to rain down unabated on our lands, rivers, and lakes. 
The mercury report does not need to be redone. I do not believe that anyone who actually reads it objectively would conclude that we need to study mercury all over again before Congress or the Executive Branch can make any decisions about controlling mercury emissions. But that is precisely what the House report language would require. If the past is any indicator of how long it will take to accomplish what is contemplated by the report language, we will be at least halfway through the first decade of the next century and buried under more than a thousand more tons of mercury before the United States can take even the most minuscule action to control this toxic pollutant. This report language is an inappropriate use of the appropriations process. Such matters of substance and impact on the health and welfare of the citizens of the United States should be debated on the floor of the Senate and House of Representatives.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for once again crafting a VA-HUD Appropriations bill which deals fairly with a wide variety of competing programs and interests. I know that budget constraints have made the job especially difficult in recent years, but within those constraints in general, this bill reaches a very good balance. 
There are two provision in the bill which I have concerns about and which I hope can be addressed in conference. The first is funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund. The Senate bill provides $55 million for this important program, $25 million below last year's level and $70 million below the President's request. 
The CDFI Fund is an economic development initiative that was adopted with overwhelming bi-partisan support several years ago. The program is an important investment tool for economically distressed communities. CDFI leverages private investment to stretch every Federal dollar. The VA-HUD Appropriations bill reported by the House Appropriations Committee includes level funding for CDFI, still well below the level requested by the Administration. This program is working effectively in communities across the country, and I believe additional resources are needed to maximize the value of this important Federal investment. I look forward to working with Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond during conference to provide additional funding for this program. 
The second provision I would like to address is Section 214 of the Senate bill. Section 214 specifically prohibits the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from providing any extra points or preferences to grant applications from Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities on the basis of their special designation. This prohibition is in direct opposition to the approach Federal Departments have taken since the creation of the Empowerment Zone program, of providing modest advantages to applications from designated communities. The grant preferences HUD offers to designated communities are indeed modest, two points out of a total score of 100. These extra points will not provide the boost needed to allow bad applications to be chosen over good ones just because the poorer application is submitted from an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. What they do provide is an incentive for designated communities to continue to pursue the initiatives they set out in their application for Empowerment Zone status. I strongly oppose this provision and will work with Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski in conference to drop it from the VA-HUD Appropriations bill.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I welcome the recent statement of the distinguished Senior Senator from New York on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor last Friday, July 10. I have been concerned for several months that consideration of this nomination was being unnecessarily delayed. I am encouraged that Senator Moynihan's evaluation of this judicial nomination for the longstanding vacancy in the Second Circuit is similar to mine. 
I know that the Senator from New York support this nomination and recall his statement of support to the Judiciary Committee at her hearing back in September 1997, almost 10 months ago. 
I appreciated his joining with me and all the Senators from States within the Second Circuit when we wrote to the Majority Leader on April 9, 1998 urging `prompt and favorable action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor.' We noted then the extraordinary action that had to be taken by the Chief Judge of our Circuit due to the vacancies crisis plaguing the Circuit. Since March 23, he has had to cancel hearings and proceed with 3-judge appellate panel that contain only one Second Circuit judge. Indeed, Chief Judge Winter has had to issue such orders in connection with matters heard this week. 
Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a well-qualified nominee. She was reportedly being held up by someone on the Republican side of the aisle because of speculation that she might be nominated this month by President Clinton to the United States Supreme Court. Last month a column in The Wall Street Journal discussed this secret basis for the Republican hold against this fine judge. The Journal revealed that this delay was intended to ensure that Sonia Sotomayor was not nominated to the Supreme Court. That was confirmed by a report in The New York Times on June 13. 
How disturbing and how shameful. I am offended by this anonymous effort to oppose her prompt confirmation by stealth tactics. Here is a highly-qualified Hispanic woman judge who should have been confirmed to help end the crisis in the Second Circuit more than four months ago. 
Judge Sotomayor rose from a housing project in the Bronx to Princeton, Yale and a federal court appointment by President Bush. She is strongly supported by the Senator from New York and has had bipartisan support. 
The excuse that had been used to delay consideration of her nomination has been removed. Perhaps now that the Supreme Court term has ended and Justice Stevens has not resigned, the Senate will proceed to consider Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the Second Circuit on its merits and confirm her without additional, unnecessary delay. There is no vacancy on the Supreme Court. The nominee has been held hostage over four months on the Senate calendar. It is past time to consider and confirm this nomination to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Second Circuit. 
Unfortunately, this past weekend the Republican Leader of the United States Senate indicated on television that he has decided to move all nominations to the `back burner.' A spokesperson for the Republican Leader indicated that the Senate will not be considering any more nominations this year. That is wrong. I hope that the Republican leadership of the Senate will reverse itself and proceed to consider the nomination of Judge Sotomayor and those of all 10 judicial nominations now stalled on the Senate calendar. 
In his annual report on the judiciary this year on New Year's Day, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.' He went on to note: `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.' I would add vote her up or vote her down. 
Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees in the 104th and 105th Congresses, the Senate is shirking its duty. This is wrong and should end. 
Today is the anniversary of the Judiciary Act of 1789. Pursuant to its constitutional responsibilities, the Senate gave meaning to the provisions of article III of our Constitution and established the lower federal courts as a means to implement the exercise of the judicial power of the United States. That was an historic act and created the foundation for our federal court system. The Senate was led in that effort by a Senator from what is now the Second Circuit, Senator Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut. 
Likewise, when the Senate established the Judiciary Committee 27 years later, it was first chaired by a Senator from the Second Circuit, Senator Dudley Chase of Vermont. 
It is sadly ironic that on this the 209th anniversary of the Judiciary Act of 1789, when the Second Circuit needs the Senate's help, the Senate majority is, instead, holding off taking action on a qualified nominee without explanation or justification. 
The Senate should consider the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit without further delay.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am here once again to talk about S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. On this date back in 1878, a gentleman named Thaddeus Hyatt was granted a patent for reinforced concrete. Now, 120 years later, the Senate is refusing to reinforce American innovation by failing to take concrete action to reform our nation's patent laws. 
We are presented with an opportunity that will not soon repeat itself--an opportunity to pass S. 507 and give U.S. inventors longer patent terms, put more royalties in their pockets, save them money in costly patent litigation, and avoid wasting their development resources on duplicative research. At the same time, we can get our new technology more rapidly into the marketplace and make U.S. companies more competitive globally. 
Remaining globally competitive is not an idle concern. The failure of this body to enact the reforms of our patent system contained in S. 507 has given foreign entities applying for and receiving patents in the U.S. unfair advantages over U.S. firms--advantages that U.S. persons filing and doing business abroad do not have. This ability to keep U.S. inventors in the dark about the latest technological developments does not work to our economic advantage. Why are we turning our backs on our businesses, small and large, by not voting on this bill? 
I have made recent speeches citing the strong support this legislation has around the country. This legislation has more than just Vermont or any state in mind. It has the entire country in its best interest. Our 200 year old patent system has provided protections to many of our inventions that have led to our global economic leadership position in the world marketplace. However, that leadership position is being threatened. Litigation has increased. Small inventors have been taken advantage of. Inventors and businesses are asking for our help and requesting that we pass S. 507. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee reported this bill out over a year ago by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 17-1, 17-1, and this bill has yet to see the light of day on the floor. No longer can we turn the other cheek when American business lets out such a cry for help. We need to bring this bill to the floor now and to pass it. We must not squander this opportunity to not only update our patent system but to come to America's defense. 
I inserted into the Record on June 23, letters of support from the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National Venture Capital Association, and the 21st Century Patent Coalition.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Chairman Cochran and his staff for pulling together this appropriations bill under very difficult circumstances. Not only was there a very low allocation, but a number of the requests were based on assumed revenue from new fees. Under these circumstances, Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers did an admirable job balancing all the agriculture programs. 
However, today we are calling attention to an urgent need in our country: the increasing outbreaks of food poisoning across the country. Almost a year ago we witnessed one of the largest beef recalls in U.S. history. Fortunately, what could have been a national health disaster was caught early and stopped. But the underlying problem remained. To address this problem the Administration requested $96 million in new food safety funds for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the hazards associated with bacteria, viruses and parasites in our food supply. Although I realize the budget allocation constrains us from funding this full amount, I join Senator Harkin to offer an amendment to fund the most urgently needed proposals of the Food Safety Initiative. 
Mr. President, there are many problems that arrive on Congress's doorstep that we can do little about. This is a problem we can--and should--address. And we need to address this problem now. A year after the 25-million pound beef recall we are still seeing headlines about new outbreaks. Each year more than 30 million Americans suffer a foodborne illness, and 9,100 die. The cost to the nation is anywhere from $5.6 billion to more than $22 billion. 
This is a national problem, ranging from cheese and egg contamination in the Pacific Northwest to tomatoes in Minnesota to shellfish and strawberries in the South. E. coli outbreaks in recent years have also been traced to contaminated sprouts, lettuce, salami and other products. Two summers in a row, in 1996 and 1997, thousands of illnesses were linked to imported raspberries containing a parasite, Cyclospora, that is not found in this country. 
After each one of these scary outbreaks, the American public is left asking the same questions--questions that the programs to be funded by this amendment and the President's Food Safety Initiative will help answer: How do these viruses move so swiftly through our food system, how can they be prevented, and where might they show up next? 
The United States enjoys the safest food supply in the world, but we can and should do better. Americans know the risk to our food supply is growing. Recent covers of Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report and newspapers across the country have asked if we can continue to trust our food supply. As a nation, we cannot afford an erosion of the public's trust in the safety of our food. 
More than 44 percent of Americans think our food supply is less safe than 10 years ago. FDA-regulated plants are only inspected on average once every 10 years. FDA import inspections have declined dramatically in just the last four years, so that now less than two percent of FDA-regulated imported food is subject to any type of inspection. 
Our amendment will increase inspections of imported food. It will fund development of improved inspection practices to detect threats to our food supply earlier and stop massive outbreaks from occurring. 
Most of us as adults have had a case of food poisoning. Anyone who has had food poisoning can imagine how much worse it is for a child. Think of what it is like when these outbreaks of e-coli, which can be devastating to adults, but can be critical and even life-threatening to children. 
Every one of us has a stake in this, whether we are involved in producing or consuming these food products, or whether or not we are parents who have to worry about what we are feeding our children. Ask people back home: Is there anything that is going to affect you more several times a day than the safety of the food you eat? Nothing else will. This is something we can and must do.  
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I and my colleague from Vermont Senator Jeffords, would like to engage Senator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, Senator Graham, and Senator Mack in a colloquy regarding Senator Graham's disaster assistance amendment. I can certainly sympathize with what Senator Graham and Senator Mack are trying to do tonight with this amendment, and I support their amendment. The fires that have struck Florida in recent weeks have shocked people from across the country, and undoubtedly the damage to agriculture in the state has been severe. However, I would like to bring attention to the fact that a number of other states have also suffered significant damage from natural disasters in recent months. My own state of Vermont suffered significant flooding early this month. Eight of the state's fourteen counties were declared disaster areas. Other parts of the country are also suffering agricultural damage including areas of the west and southeast which are suffering serious drought conditions. Damage from these disasters is still being determined, however by the time we go to conference with the House on the Agriculture Appropriations bill, we will have a better idea about the extent of those damages. I hope that at that point we can revisit this disaster assistance and adjust the funding levels to reflect the full extent of agricultural damage from natural disasters being suffered by farmers throughout the country.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I raise the visibility of a little-known, but praiseworthy, program--the Nutrition Education and Training Program. I am speaking today in defense of this program, which now seems to be on life-support, and in dire need of resuscitation. For those who are not aware, the Nutrition Education and Training Program, NET, is a direct grant-to-States program which provides the nutrition education and food service training component of the Child Nutrition Programs. Under NET, all funds are distributed to the States. States and local governments leverage these limited resources into effective and innovative education and training programs for children, food service personnel, and parents. I know in my own State of Vermont, the creativity and innovation of the NET staff has provided unique and valuable nutrition materials that are relevant to thousands of Vermonters. Over the past 20 years, NET has promoted an infrastructure and quality standards that support local schools in providing nutritious meals and improving the health and nutrition behavior of our Nation's children. State and local NET coordinators have been responsible for much of the local success of the nutrition education effort. 
NET programs are intended to teach children about the nutritional value of foods and the relationship between food and health. The program is also intended to provide nutrition education for teachers and training in nutrition and food service management for school food service personnel, and to facilitate development of classroom materials and curricula. This is done through a State Nutrition Education Coordinator who identifies the needs of the State--this is important--the program is not one size fits all, full of restrictions and mandates from Washington, but rather a cooperative program that is tailored to State needs. 
Sadly, I am here today to report on the dire funding status of NET. In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, NET has struggled along at a level of only $3.75 million--this is a far cry from the original program in 1978-79 of $26.2 million--giving each State a level of 50 cents per child. The fiscal year 1999 House appropriations bill funds NET at only $3.75 million and the Senate bill provides nothing--putting all funds into Team Nutrition at $10 million. This low level of funding has diminished NET's effectiveness and threatens its viability to provide nutrition education to the nearly $9 billion Child Nutrition Programs it supports. 
A few years ago, as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I supported a change in the law to provide NET with a guaranteed $10 million per year to provide important Nutrition Education activities. This level is not a budget-busting amount, and is in fact the amount the President requested in the fiscal year 1999 budget for this program. Unfortunately, in the rush toward welfare reform in 1996, NET's status as a mandatory program was rescinded, and the funding levels for NET have been problematic ever since. 
I urge when the Conference on the Agriculture appropriations bill convenes that NET be provided adequate funding. The Child Nutrition Programs are absolutely critical to our Nation's future. Along with those benefits, we must give our children the chance to choose the right foods, to select a diet suited for them based on the facts and not on the latest billion-dollar junk food advertising.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would also like to applaud the computer industry's efforts to find alternative technical solutions to help law enforcement with the challenge of encrypted data and communications without the need to establish a government-mandated key escrow or key recovery scheme. With the appropriate privacy safeguards in place, as outlined in the E-PRIVACY bill, S.2067, the solution that the companies are proposing appears encouraging. American companies are desperate for a common sense approach to our export policy on encryption. As you are well aware, the Administration, starting with Clipper Chip, has been wedded to key escrow schemes to ensure that the FBI can get access to plaintext, or unscrambled electronic data. This path has been pursued despite the serious questions that experts have raised about the costs, privacy risks and lack of consumer interest in such schemes. As U.S. companies watch their market share for computer hardware and software products erode because of our country's outdated export controls on encryption, it is imperative that the Administration direct the FBI to consider creative alternatives to key escrow.

Mr. LEAHY. I agree, the announcement by the high-tech companies of alternative means of access to plaintext to encrypted data demonstrates industry's commitment to find solutions that accommodate law enforcement interests. It also reiterates the need for privacy protection legislation to ensure that law enforcement only gets such access with a proper court order. The E-PRIVACY bill, S. 2067, which I have sponsored with Senator Ashcroft, and others, would provide that privacy protection.

Mr. LEAHY. Encryption technology is not only a critical tool for protecting the confidentiality of our online communications and the privacy of our stored electronic information, it is also the building block for digital signatures. The future of electronic commerce requires that parties conducting business online be able to trust the authenticity of the contracts they enter and that the parties with whom they are dealing are who they say they are. In fact, a number of States, including my own State of Vermont, are making progress on crafting the rules for digital signatures and online commercial transactions.

Mr. LEAHY. While digital signature legislation at the Federal level may help encourage the 
development of online commercial transaction rules, we must be careful not to stifle the development of efficient and inexpensive digital signature services by prematurely regulating --or granting Federal agencies unfettered authority to regulate--in this area. We must particularly avoid creating a federal system for digital signatures that will become the national i.d. card for cyberspace. The Administration in its `Framework for Global Electronic Commerce' got it right when it said that `participants in the marketplace--including consumers, business, financial institutions, and on-line service providers--should define and articulate most of the rules that will govern electronic commerce.'

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this month, a three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit decided United States v. Singleton, in which it found that the prosecutor had violated the federal gratuity statute and a state ethics rule by entering a plea agreement with a cooperating defendant that made certain promises in exchange for the cooperator's truthful testimony at trial. The promises in question were the sort of plain vanilla promises that appear in virtually every cooperation agreement, and are the lifeblood of bringing successful prosecutions. 
As a former prosecutor, I found this decision bizarre and dangerous. In effect, it makes it illegal--a federal felony--for prosecutors to offer leniency in return for testimony on the theory that leniency is a form of bribery. Defense attorneys across the country have already begun to jump on the Singleton bandwagon. In my state, Vermont, the decision has already triggered new motions in a major drug smuggling case involving a billion dollars worth of hashish. The defendant, Martin Scott, is scheduled to go to trial in September, and the government's evidence includes testimony by cooperating codefendants. Scott has now moved to exclude this testimony on the ground that it was obtained unlawfully in return for government promises of leniency, citing Singleton. 
If this controversial decision stands, prosecutors would be exposed to the threat of felony liability and disciplinary action just for doing their jobs. In addition, this decision could result in a tidal wave of reversals and suppression rulings in cases involving cooperator testimony. 
I was relieved to see that the Tenth Circuit acted swiftly to vacate the panel decision and set the case down for en banc rehearing in November, and I am confident that the ruling will eventually be thrown out--but not before the issue has been raised and relitigated at every turn in every district and circuit court in the land. At a minimum, this will delay trials, squander scarce judicial resources, and generally waste everyone's time. 
We need to insure that prosecutors have the tools they need to do their jobs effectively, and being able to enter into cooperation agreements is critical. That's why I am introducing legislation today to make crystal clear that prosecutors and other public officials acting in the performance of their official duties may enter cooperation agreements and make other such commitments, assurances and promises in return for truthful testimony.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate passed the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, S. 2022. 
I am proud to join Senator DeWine in supporting our bipartisan legislation to authorize comprehensive Department of Justice grants to every state for criminal justice identification, information and communications technologies and systems. I applaud the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for his leadership. I also commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Leader for their strong support of the Crime Identification Technology Act. 
I know from my experience in law enforcement in Vermont over the last 30 years that access to quality, accurate information in a timely fashion is of vital importance. As we prepare to enter the 21st Century, we must provide our state and local law enforcement officers with the resources to develop the latest technological tools and communications systems to solve and prevent crime. I believe this bill accomplishes that goal. 
The Crime Identification Technology Act authorizes $250 million for each of the next five years in grants to states for crime information and identification systems. The Attorney General, through the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is directed to make grants to each state to be used in conjunction with units of local government, and other states, to use information and identification technologies and systems to upgrade criminal history and criminal justice record systems. 
Grants made under our legislation may include programs to establish, develop, update or upgrade: 
State, centralized, automated criminal history record information systems, including arrest and disposition reporting. 
Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize fingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible with systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index (III). 
Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact. 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility determinations. 
Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and communicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, prosecution, and corrections. 
Non-criminal history record information systems relevant to firearms eligibility determinations for availability and accessibility to the NICS. 
Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting of dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI and to promote the compatibility with, and integration of, court systems with other criminal justice information systems. 
Ballistics identification programs that are compatible and integrated with the ballistics programs of the National Integrated Ballistics Network (NIBN). 
Information, identification and communications programs for forensic purposes. 
DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes. 
Sexual offender identification and registration systems. 
Domestic violence offender identification and information systems. 
Programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal justice purposes including youth service employees and volunteers and other individuals in positions of trust, if authorized by federal or state law and administered by a government agency. 
Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide statistical and research products including incident-based reporting systems and uniform crime reports. 
Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and programs. 
Multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional communications systems to share routine and emergency information among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 
Let me just give a couple of examples from my home State of Vermont that illustrate how our comprehensive legislation will aid state and local law enforcement agencies across the country. 
The future of law enforcement must focus on working together to harness the power of today s information age to prevent crime and catch criminals. One way to work together is for state and local law enforcement agencies to band together to create efficiencies of scale. For example, together with New Hampshire and Maine, the State of Vermont has pooled its resources together to build a tri-state IAFIS system to identify fingerprints. Our bipartisan legislation would foster these partnerships by allowing groups of States to apply together for grants. 
Another challange for law enforcement agencies across the country is communication difficulties between federal, state and local law enforcement officials. In a recent report, the Department of Justice s National Institute of Justice concluded that law enforcement agencies throughout the nation lack adequate communications systems to respond to crimes that cross state and local jurisdictions. 
A 1997 incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border underscored this problem. During a cross border shooting spree that left four people dead including two New Hampshire state troopers, Vermont and New Hampshire officers were forced to park two police cruisers next to one another to coordinate activities between federal, state and local law enforcement officers because the two states' police radios could not communicate with one another. 
The Vermont Department of Public Safety, the Vermont U.S. Attorney s Office and others have reacted to this communications problem by developing the Northern Lights proposal. This project will allow the northern borders States of Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine to integrate their law enforcement communications systems to better coordinate interdiction efforts and share intelligence data seamlessly. 
Our legislation would provide grants for the development of integrated Federal, State and local law enforcement communications systems to foster cutting edge efforts like the Northern Lights project. 
In addition, our bipartisan legislation will help each of our States meet its obligations under national anti-crime initiatives. For instance, the FBI will soon bring online NCIC 2000 and IAFIS which will require states to update their criminal justice systems for the country to benefit. States are also being asked to participate in several other national programs such as sexual offender registries, national domestic violence legislation, Brady Act, and National Child Protection Act. 
Currently, there are no comprehensive programs to support these national crime-fighting systems. Our legislation will fill this void by helping the each State meet its obligations under these Federal laws. 
The Crime Identification Technology Act provides a helping hand with the heavy hand of a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach. Unfortunately, some in Congress have pushed legislation mandating minute detail changes that States must make in their laws to qualify for Federal funds. Our bill rejects this approach. Instead, we provide the States with Federal support to improve their criminal justice idenfication, information and communication systems without prescriping new Federal mandates 
Mr. President, we have patterned the administration of the technology grants under our bill after the highly successful DOJ National Criminal History Improvement Program (N-CHIP),which was created by the 1993 Brady Act. 
The Vermont Department of Public Safety has received funds under the N-CHIP program for the past three years and I have been proud to strongly support their efforts. With that Federal assistance, Vermont has been achieved acquiring the automated fingerprint identification system in conjunction with Maine and New Hampshire, upgrading its records repository computer systems, as well as extending their online incident-based reporting system to local jurisdictions throughout Vermont. Our bill builds on the Justice Department s existing infrastructure under the successful N-CHIP program to provide fair and effective grant administration. 
I know that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Reno's leadership, has made it a priority to modernize and automate criminal history records. Our legislation will continue that leadership by providing each State with the necessary resources to continue to make important efforts to bring their criminal justice systems up to date. 
I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to act quickly on the Crime Identification Technology Act to ensure that each State has the resources to capture the power of emerging information and communications technologies to serve and protect all of our citizens.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate passed, S.2294, the National Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act. I want to thank Senators Hatch, DeWine and Daschle for their strong support of this legislation to enact the Interstate Identification Index (III) Compact. 
This Compact is the product of a decade-long effort by federal and state law enforcement officials to establish a legal framework for the exchange of criminal history records for authorized noncriminal justice purposes, such as security clearances, employment or licensing background checks. 
Since 1924, the FBI has collected and maintained duplicate state and local fingerprint cards, along with arrest and disposition records. Today, the FBI has over 200 million fingerprint cards in its system. These FBI records are accessible to authorized government entities for both criminal and authorized noncriminal justice purposes. 
Maintaining duplicate files at the FBI is costly and leads to inaccuracies in the criminal history records, since follow-up disposition information from the States is often incomplete. Such a huge central database of routinely incomplete criminal history records raises significant privacy concerns. 
In addition, the FBI releases these records for noncriminal justice purposes (as authorized by Federal law), to State agencies upon request, even if the State from which the records originated or the receiving State more narrowly restricts the dissemination of such records for noncriminal justice purposes. 
The III Compact is an effort to get the FBI out of the business of holding a duplicate copy of every State and local criminal history record, and instead to keep those records at the State level. Once fully implemented, the FBI will only need to hold the Interstate Identification Index (III), consisting of the national fingerprint file and a pointer index to direct the requestor to the correct State records repository. The Compact would eliminate the necessity for duplicate records at the FBI for those States participating in the Compact. Eventually, when all the States become full participants in the Compact, the FBI s centralized files of state offender records will be discontinued and users of such records will obtain those records from the appropriate State s central repository (or from the FBI if the offender has a federal record). 
The Compact would establish both a framework for this cooperative exchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes, and create a Compact Council with representatives from the FBI and the States to monitor system operations and issue necessary rules and procedures for the integrity and accuracy of the records and compliance with privacy standards. Importantly, this Compact would not in any way expand or diminish noncriminal justice purposes for which criminal history records may be used under existing State or Federal law. 
Overall, I believe that the Compact would increase the accuracy, completeness and privacy protection for criminal history records. 
In addition, the Compact would result in important cost savings from establishing a decentralized system. Under the system envisioned by the Compact, the FBI would hold only an index and pointer to the records maintained at the originating State. The FBI would no longer have to maintain duplicate State records. Moreover, States would no longer have the burden and costs of submitting arrest fingerprints and charge/disposition data to the FBI for all arrests. Instead, the State would only have to submit to the FBI the fingerprints and textual identification data for a person s first arrest. 
With this system, criminal history records would be more up-to-date, or complete, because a decentralized system will keep the records closer to their point of origin in State repositories, eliminating the need for the States to keep sending updated disposition information to the FBI. To ensure further accuracy, the Compact would require requests for criminal history checks for noncriminal justice purposes to be submitted with fingerprints or some other form of positive identification, to avoid mistaken release of records. 
Furthermore, under the Compact, the newly created Council must establish procedures to require that the most current records are requested and that when a new need arises, a new record check is conducted. 
Significantly, the newly created Council must establish privacy enhancing procedures to ensure that requested criminal history records are only used by authorized officials for authorized purposes. Furthermore, the Compact makes clear that only the FBI and authorized representatives from the State repository may have direct access to the FBI index. The Council must also ensure that only legally appropriate information is released and, specifically, that record entries that may not be used for noncriminal justice purposes are deleted from the response. 
Thus, while the Compact would require the release of arrest records to a requesting State, the Compact would also ensure that if disposition records are available that the complete record be released. Also, the Compact would require States receiving records under the Compact to ensure that the records are disseminated in compliance with the authorized uses in that State. Consequently, under the Compact, a State that receives arrest-only information would have to give effect to disposition-only policies in that State and not release that information for noncriminal justice purposes. Thus, in my view, the impact of the Compact for the privacy and accuracy of the records would be positive. 
I am pleased to have joined with Senators Hatch and DeWine to make a number of refinements to the Compact as transmitted by to us by the Administration. Specifically, we have worked to clarify that (1) the work of the Council includes establishing standards to protect the privacy of the records; (2) sealed criminal history records are not covered or subject to release for noncriminal justice purposes under the Compact; (3) the meetings of the Council are open to the public, and (4) the Council s decisions, rules and procedures are available for public inspection and copying and published in the Federal Register. 
Commissioner Walton of the Vermont Department of Public Safety supports this Compact. He hopes that passage of the Compact will encourage Vermont to become a full participant in III for both criminal and noncriminal justice purposes, so that Vermont can reap the benefits of cost savings and improved data quality. The Compact is also strongly supported by the FBI and SEARCH. 
We all have an interest in making sure that the criminal history records maintained by our law enforcement agencies at the local, State and Federal levels, are complete, accurate and accessible only to authorized personnel for legally authorized purposes. This Compact is a significant step in the process of achieving that goal.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee has repeatedly postponed hearings regarding the performance of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, including one that had been noticed for this morning. I am disappointed that this hearing was canceled because it would have offered us a chance to look at the outstanding on-the-job performance of Bill Lann Lee, our Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
At the end of last year, Bill Lee got caught up in one of the political whirlwinds that hit Washington every now and then. The result was that he became a victim of the right wing anti-affirmative action lobby and was denied a fair chance at a vote by the full Senate on his nomination to head the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee was mischaracterized last fall as a wild-eyed radical and as someone ready to impose an extreme agenda on the United States. He was also mis-portrayed as a supporter of quotas. 
I knew nothing could be further from the truth. After looking at Bill Lee's record, I knew he was a man who could effectively lead the Civil Rights Division, enforce the law and resolve disputes. I noted at the time: `He has been involved in approximately 200 cases in his 23 years of law practice, and he has settled all but six of them. Clearly, this is strong evidence that Mr. Lee is a problem solver and practical in his approach to the law. No one who has taken the time to thoroughly review his record could call him an idealogue.' I recognized last fall that Bill Lee would be reasonable and practical in his approach to the job, and that he would be a top-notch enforcer of the Nation's civil rights laws. 
Last December, after this nomination was blocked from going to the Senate for an up or down vote, the President and the Attorney General determined that the right thing to do was to have Bill Lee proceed to act as the head of the Civil Rights Division and to resubmit his nomination to the Senate. The Nation needs leadership in this important position. Bill Lee has been serving for seven months now, and he has established a solid track record. It is a shame that today's hearing was canceled, because it would have been a chance to show the Nation what an outstanding job he is doing for all Americans. 
In preparation for the scheduled hearing, I have had a chance to take a close look at what Bill Lee has been doing while serving as the acting head of the Civil Rights Division. What I find is a record of strong accomplishments. In addition, I see professionalism and effective problem solving. I find him enforcing the law in a sensible and fair manner. 
Over the past seven months, the Division has focused most intensely on three areas of the law: violations of our Nation's fair housing laws, enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (`ADA'), and cases involving hate crimes. Bill Lee and his team of civil rights attorneys have made advances in each of these areas of the law. 
The Division has resolved the following housing discrimination cases over the past few months: 
An agreement was reached with two large New Jersey apartment complexes resolving allegations that the defendants had discriminated against potential renters based on family status and race. A housing discrimination case in Michigan was settled involving an apartment manager who told black applicants that no apartments were available at the same time that he was showing vacant apartments to white applicants. An agreement was also reached with the second largest real estate company in Alabama, which had been steering applicants to agents and residential areas based on race. 
The Civil Rights Division has also focused on educating the public about the ADA and enforcing it where necessary. These cases have included: resolution of a case in Hawaii to allow those who are vision impaired to travel to the State without having to quarantine their guide dogs for four months in advance of arrival; a consent decree with the National Collegiate Athletic Association so that high school athletes with learning disabilities have the opportunity to compete for scholarships and participate in college athletics; an agreement with private hospitals in Connecticut to ensure patients who are deaf have access to sign-language interpreters; and assistance to the State of Florida to update their building code to bring it into compliance with the ADA. Florida joins Maine, Texas and Washington State in having a certified building code thereby ensuring better compliance with the ADA by architects, builders and contractors within the State. 
The Civil Rights Division has also resolved several hate crimes cases over the past seven months, including: In Idaho, six men pled guilty to engaging in a series of racially motivated attacks on Mexican American men, women and children, some as young as 9; in Arizona, three members of a skinhead group pled guilty to burning a cross in the front yard of an African American woman; and in Texas, a man pled guilty to entering a Jewish temple and firing several gun shots while shouting anti-Semitic slurs. 
The Division has also been vigorously enforcing its criminal statutes, including: indictments against three people in Arkansas charged with church burning; guilty pleas by 16 Puerto Rico correctional officers who beat 22 inmates and then tried to cover it up; cases arising from Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14, being lured to the U.S. and then being forced into prostitution; and guilty pleas from 18 defendants who forced 60 deaf Mexican nationals to sell trinkets on the streets of New York. Out of concerns about slavery continuing in the U.S., Bill Lee has created a Worker Exploitation Task Force to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Department of Labor. I commend Mr. Lee for putting the spotlight on these shameful crimes. 
Other significant cases which the Civil Rights Division has handled in the past few months include the following: several long-standing school desegregation cases were settled or their consent decrees were terminated, including cases in Kansas City, Kansas; San Juan County, Utah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Japanese-Latin Americans who were deported and interned in the United States during World War II finally received compensation this year. Lawsuits in Ohio and Washington, D.C. were settled to allow women access to women's health clinics. 
This record indicates that Bill Lee has been running the Division the way it should be run. Here in Washington, where we have lots of show horses, Bill Lee is a work horse--a dedicated public official who is working hard to help solve our Nation's problems. I like people who get the job done. I commend Bill Lann Lee and the many hardworking professionals at the Civil Rights Division. 
Bill Lee has served as acting head of the Civil Rights Division for seven months now. Given the claims made by many in the Senate last fall that Mr. Lee would lead the Division astray, you might expect that he would be in the headlines every day associated with some extreme decision. Instead, we have seen the strong and steady work of the Division--solid achievements and effective law enforcement. 
Just last week, I received a letter from Governor Zell Miller of Georgia that is emblematic of the record that Bill Lee has established. Governor Miller discusses Bill Lee's efficient and effective ability to settle an action which involved Georgia's juvenile detention facilities. He notes that he was not exactly a fan of the Civil Rights Division before Bill Lee came along and writes that he `was fearful that Georgia would be unable to get a fair forum in which to present our position, and that we would once again be compelled to engage in protracted and expensive litigation.' Governor Miller writes that his fears were unfounded, that the parties engaged in `intensive and expeditious negotiations' and reached a fair agreement. Governor Miller also notes:  
I have indicated to Mr. Lee both personally and publicly that he and his staff treated Georgia with professionalism, fairness, and respect during our negotiations. Under the direction of Bill Lann Lee, what began as a potentially divisive and litigious process was transformed into an atmosphere where the State was able to have its case heard fairly, resulting in a reasonable agreement benefiting all parties. This is the way in which the Civil Rights Division should operate in its dealings with the states, and I am pleased to commend Mr. Lee and his staff for their efforts in this matter. 
Bill Lee continues to build on his reputation as a professional and effective negotiator who routinely earns praise from opposing parties. I had high expectations for Bill Lee when he was nominated and I have not been disappointed. He is doing a terrific job, and I know that he will keep up the good work. 
The President renominated Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division on January 29 of this year. Given his outstanding performance over the past seven months, I hope Chairman Hatch and the other Republican members of the Judiciary Committee will reconsider his nomination, review his record and favorably report the nomination of Bill Lee to the Senate so that he may be confirmed as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Bill Lee deserves it.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, I am amazed on this issue. I look at the schedule set by the distinguished Speaker of the House, and we have so very few legislative days remaining that now we have this as a top priority--a bill to strip zoning and land use decisions from small towns and cities and counties--instead of passing important funding bills. 
I do know the law requires us to have a budget by April 15; it also requires us to file our taxes bill April 15--we demand every person in the country do that. But it seems that the majority of the Republican leadership did not find it in their heart to obey their own law to pass the budget by that time. 
I am not sure we have passed the budget. We passed one in the Senate; the House, months later, passed one; I don't believe it has been conferenced. 
Anyway, these are things we cannot seem to find time to do, that the law requires us to do. The law requires us to file our income tax returns. The law requires the House and Senate to pass a budget by April 15. But the other body, at least, never got around to doing that. 
We weren't able to find time to pass a tobacco bill, so there is not one that might be different from exactly what the tobacco companies want. We certainly haven't found time to pass legislation to increase patients' rights. We found it impossible to find time to pass legislation on campaign financing. But now we seem to be looking for the time to consider a bill that will take power away from State and local government. That power that we take from State and local government will go to the Federal courts. 
This is the same U.S. Senate, Madam President, which has found it difficult to perform its constitutional duty to fill the scores of vacancies in the same Federal courts. On the one hand, we are saying we will not fill the vacancies; we will leave 75 to 100 vacancies in the Federal court. The U.S. Senate can't find time to confirm the people who are pending, like Sonia Sotomayor and others. But we have time to say we don't care what the States think in their courts. We don't care what counties and municipalities think in their courts. We will take their power away from them and dump them in the Federal court. Now, we are not going to have enough judges in the Federal court to handle the cases, because we will give the Federal courts a whole lot of jurisdiction they never asked for and don't want, in an unprecedented--unprecedented--exercise in antifederalism and unprecedented exercise of the Federal Government reaching into the States and stripping away their power and dumping into a Federal court. That is what we are spending our time on. 
Maybe I made a mistake in reading some of the rhetoric that went with the Contract on America that my good friends on the other side of the aisle proposed which talked about giving power back to the States, back to the communities. They said: We have to get the Federal Government off your back. And yet now we have a piece of legislation which says: Whoops, we are going to take all your power away from you and give it to the Federal courts. Well, well, well. 
This is a bill that would federalize local zoning decisions. This is a bill which goes against everything that the Republican Party has said they stood for, certainly everything that the people in my State, Republicans and Democrats, stand for, and that is giving power to local people. This goes against it. Why? Because its unabashed purpose is to give wealthy developers increased power to short-circuit communities' decisions, those decisions made through the public processes of local government. 
Basically, what this is, it is a bill to instill the golden rule, saying, if you have got the gold, you are going to make the rules. That is basically what it is. If you have got plenty of money, don't worry about pesky little things like a State court or zoning court or the things a community has a stake in; ignore those, because you can make your decision from your corporate headquarters 2,000 miles away, and you could care less what the people of Bar Harbor, ME, or Burlington, VT, might think because you have got the money and you have got the bill.

Mr. LEAHY. I understand the Senator from Louisiana wanted time from Senator Hatch. If we could wait just one more moment for him to come back? 
But while we are waiting for Senator Hatch to come back, let me just take a moment to offer what is really an example of the profits this bill will give to developers and the downfall it will be to homeowner rights. 
One thing I heard from every mayor and local official about this bill is the fear of battles with large corporate developers with deep pockets. Instead of waging these battles, most mayors concede they will probably settle the cases and give in to the developers. It will be a field day for land speculators who buy land zoned for, let's say, farming and then sue in Federal court to have the land rezoned for commercial or residential purposes, because now they suddenly change their mind the day after buying it and say they no longer want to be farmers; they just want to make millions as developers. 
One Senate staffer who works on this issue came across a timely example. He was visiting his boyhood hometown in Cortland County, NY, over the Fourth of July weekend. He told me about a pertinent situation. 
A farm adjacent to about 25 homes on a small lake, Little York Lake, was recently sold for $2,000 per acre for a total of $65,000. A speculator bought the land which he wants to now sell for $30,000 per acre to make a quick profit of around $1 million. To do that, he has to evade local zoning and health requirements. The speculator knows the land, sold as farmland, is worth about $2,000 per acre. But if you sell it for residential or business development, it could be worth 15 times more. But, of course, it would greatly reduce the property values of neighboring homeowners living in the community. They would be hurt by it, but one speculator would benefit if he is able to change the rules. 
The persons who sold the land to the speculator might have wished they had thought about just avoiding local land-use regulations. They could have made a whole lot of money if they did it themselves, but they didn't want to. They wanted to obey the rules. 
This bill would allow the speculator to get into Federal court. It would certainly be futile for him to apply for construction permits for business, since the land is not zoned for that use. So why bother to work with the local governing body? Why bother to find a solution that might be acceptable to everybody? Instead, under the bill he could just sue them for taking the hoped-for profits or have his attorney make them change their zoning requirements. Incidentally, the land is located on the aquifer that provides the water for the community. 
Well, Madam President, I don't want to see this example replicated across the country. Fighting for the Department of Agriculture programs to help conserve our Nation's farmland, I don't want to say we passed S. 2271, which throws that out. 
Madam President, I understand that Senator Hatch has said if I want to yield time to the Senator from Louisiana--how much time would my friend like?

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I listened with interest to my good friend, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah. He said that perhaps some of those who are opposed to this may not understand the bill. There is a reason for this. The bill we are discussing is S. 2271 which was introduced just last week. We never had a hearing on S. 2271. While we had a hearing on H.R. 1534 this bill is significantly different from S. 2271. S. 2271 was just printed late last week and many Members may not have had an opportunity to carefully review it. 
This new bill just came bouncing in here. We haven't had one single hearing on this particular bill. My good friend from Utah talks of the care that went into it. This arrived full-blown, full-grown on the Senate floor--not one single Senate hearing on this bill. In fact, the bill on which we did hold a hearing, H.R. 1534, apparently bothered them enough that it was significantly changed. We haven't done a report on S. 2271. One was done on H.R. 1534 but not on S. 2271. Madam President, no Senator can point to 30 seconds of Senate hearing on S. 2271. No Senator can point to a two-sentence report on this bill. 
A lot of Senators probably did not even have a chance to look at S. 2271. Apparently, they thought H.R. 1534 should be changed. But this is a new bill that many of us feel is worse than its predecessor. But there have been no hearings on the changed text. There is no report on S. 2271, and under some new streamlined process the bill was just sent to the floor. We will vote on S. 2271, and then we will debate it later. It is like Alice in Wonderland. You have the sentencing first, and the trial later. This is not the way the U.S. Senate should act. 
I think that is why the National Governors' Association, the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National Conference of State Legislatures all stated their opposition to this new bill. Just 3 days ago, they said:  
A review of the most recent proposed revisions to the legislation makes clear that those changes do not address our fundamental problems with the bill * * * The framers of the Constitution never intended federal courts to be the first resort in resolving community disputes between local governments and private parties. In our view, these issues should be settled locally, as close to the affected community as possible. 
In fact, some would say H.R. 1534, the earlier bill, would be better than S. 2271. S. 2271 is more burdensome to local governments than earlier versions. 
First, the revised bill goes even further in limiting Federal judges' ability to abstain from cases dealing with local land use decisions. Maybe they have to abstain because we don't fill the vacancies of Federal courts. But assuming there is a Federal court and a Federal judge who has been lucky enough to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, they have a limited ability to abstain. In S. 2271 a Federal judge in many circumstances cannot abstain from or relinquish jurisdiction to a State court because the plaintiff `brings a prior or concurrent proceeding before a State, territory, or local tribunal.' 
This revision effectively turns the earlier version of this provision on its head. Rather than leaving room for abstention when a State law claim is asserted, the revised version specifically states that a district court shall not abstain when there is a State law claim. 
I don't know when we have ever done anything like this. This is an unprecedented big-foot action on the part of the Federal Government of stepping in and telling local citizens and state courts, `You don't count,' as far as the U.S. Senate is concerned. 
Rather than reducing interference with State court resolution of State and local law issues, the revised version of the bill actually would maximize Federal court interference with State courts. 
Second, the revisions make the bill worse from a local government standpoint by eliminating the authority conferred on local governments in the bill as reported by committee to define a `meaningful application.' 
Instead, the revised bill would allow Federal courts to get into looking at local land use requirements and applications. Other changes in the bill are either harmful, cosmetic or without significant effect. 
As a general matter, the bill would introduce new vague terminology which could lead to years of litigation over the meaning of this new language. And, of course, we are asked to enact S. 2271 without even a report. Enactment of the new legislation would make land use litigation process more time-consuming. 
Look at the insertion of the phrase `one meaningful application to use the property . . . within a reasonable time.' This change ostensibly addresses the concern that H.R. 1534, as reported, suggests an applicant only had to initiate a local application or waiver proceeding, but not necessarily await the outcome of the proceeding before suing in Federal court. 
The change to `within a reasonable time' simply confirms that in some circumstances a developer would be able to proceed to Federal court without first obtaining local decisions. Many States and local governments already have specific time limits for administrative decisions. That seems to throw it out of the window. 
I have said over and over again that when property is taken, the landowner should be compensated. That is what our Constitution requires--it requires just compensation. That is what local, State and federal Governments are doing. Certainly, there has been no need for such sweeping legislation demonstrated. 
I wish we had an opportunity to work with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to have a better bill. It is his prerogative not to have a hearing on this particular bill or to have a detailed report on it. 
And we have instances where my friend from Utah says that this bill applies only to owners of property, but it defines owner as the owner or possessor of property or rights in property. That is more expansive than the normal meaning of the word owner. Somebody who steals property is a possessor of property. An adverse possessor of property is by definition in possession of the property. As I said, we have a case here where something is not broken, but we are about to fix it anyway. 
Madam President, I withhold the balance of my time. I ask the Chair, how much time remains to the Senator from Vermont?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. There may have been another unanimous consent request when I was off the floor. 
If somebody had sought recognition and yielded time for that person to speak, they do not call the quorum call, and nobody else seeks recognition subsequent to their speaking, does the time continue to run against whoever had been yielded time?

Mr. LEAHY. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
We continue to hear what an improvement we have in the new bill, S. 2271, as compared to H.R. 1534. Maybe it is, but maybe it isn't an improved bill. I don't believe it is an improved bill but it is a different bill. 
Frankly, we have before the Senate a different piece of legislation in which there has not been 38 seconds of hearings. We have before the Senate a bill which, unlike other major legislation, does not have a specific report before the Senate. We have a bill that is brought down in time for the Monday afternoon bed check vote, without a report, without a hearing. 
Mr. President, we are asked to pass a piece of legislation that would dramatically encroach on the rights of the municipalities, counties, and States in our country. It would be a massive shift of power from the local people and communities to the Federal courts. 
I think one of the reasons it is being rushed through is that the big developers who want it don't want the public to look at this very long. But those who have looked at it are opposed to it. That includes the National Governors' Association, the National Association of Counties. Others who oppose it include the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Towns and Townships, the National Conference of State Legislatures. The bill that was reported, H.R. 1534, was also opposed by those groups and the International Municipal Lawyers Association, 38 State attorneys general, and the American Planning Association. 
Among those opposed to having that unprecedented shift of power to the Federal courts are the Judicial Conference of the U.S. Conference of Chief Justices and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. 
Among those religious organizations opposed to that bill are the United States Catholic Conference, the National Council of Churches of Christ, Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism, and the Evangelicals for Social Action. 
Among the public interest groups that are opposed to it are the League of Women Voters, the Alliance for Justice, the Physicians for Social Responsibility, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
Among the conservation groups against it are the National Wildlife Federation and the League of Conservation Voters. Those who oppose it include the Sierra Club, the National Environmental Trust, the Environmental Working Group, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Audubon Society, the Great Lakes United, the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund, Izaak Walton League of America, the Scenic America, and the Wilderness Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Rails to Trails Conservancy, and the National Parks and Conservation Association, Friends of the Earth, Defenders of Wildlife, Appalachian Mountain Club, and the American Oceans Campaign. 
Among those who are opposed to it are the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and the United Steelworkers of America. 
For the same reason that this Vermonter is opposed to the new bill, S. 2271, the Vermont League of Cities and Counties, is also opposed. They just wrote to me on the new bill saying:  
Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing you to express our strong support for your actions in opposing S. 2271. * * * 
Local governments are working very hard in Vermont to exercise appropriate authority over land uses in their communities. We are joined in this in very real fashion by the Vermont legislature which this past session adopted legislation clarifying our ability to regulate wireless telecommunication facilities under zoning. 
What would a volunteer part-time planning commission or zoning board of authority do if a national wireless telecommunications company came into town, not only with its platoon of attorneys and engineers but also with the ability to say, `you take a wrong step and you're in federal court?' 
Continuing from their letter: 
The chilling effect of that combination would be immense. It is already hard to find people willing to serve on local boards and commissions. With the threats proposed in the Takings legislation, many good public servants at the local level would simply give up. 
That is from the Vermont League of Cities and Towns. 
In an earlier letter, they asked me `At what cost to the communities?' This is a question being answered at the local level by local zoning boards of Charlotte, Hardwick, Cabot, and other towns throughout the State. I think we ought to pay some attention to it. In the Sunday Burlington Free Press, the homebuilders themselves made this statement regarding urban sprawl: 
Urban growth is not really Congress' purview. . . . I think most Members of Congress recognize that planning ought to take place at a local or State level. 
Then I ask, why are they pushing this bill? They want the Federal Government to take authority away from our States. Do the homebuilders need this for a win? 
I said earlier that we Vermonters may differ in the way our State and communities should be handled as compared to how they would be handled by some large-scale, wealthy developer. That is our choice to make. I spoke of some of the most beautiful spots in our State that my wife and I love driving by. Each one has enormous developmental value, but we Vermonters have decided not to develop it. Now, we Vermonters pay the price for that. We get less tax revenue. We make less from our land; I know I do from my own land. 
I have 220 acres on my tree farm. We could earn a lot more if Vermont suddenly zoned everything for commercial use. But I don't want to do that. I like the quality of life in Vermont. I like not having to lock my door. I like being able to walk through my fields and see a deer, or to ski down one of the logging trails on my property, as I have in the wintertime, and to see an owl floating on the thermals ahead of me by the moonlight. I liked being awakened about 3 o'clock this morning by the screech of a bear near my home. Frankly, I like that better than the screech of brakes in a congested urban intersection. 
They also told us we would lose a great deal in Vermont when we did away with billboards. But a couple out-of-State billboard companies didn't do so well. The scenic vistas of Vermont were opened up and the tourism increased. 
Mr. President, we ought to stop taking things out of the hands of small communities and counties in our States. We ought to let the people of West Virginia make their decisions and the people of Vermont make their decision and not say: We are going to yank this out of your hands and put it in Federal court. 
Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we can probably sit here on the floor and think of some horror stories where a town made a mistake in holding something up. We could point somewhere to some local court where another mistake might have been made, or to a few prosecutors out of the thousands of our local prosecutors where one bad judgment call was made. 
But we don't have the arrogance in this body to say we will take over all our local courts, all our local communities, all our local prosecutors, and turn them over to the Feds because mistakes won't be made. Because I can tell you right now that for every mistake made at the local level I could point to a bigger one made at the Federal level. I think that is why the Judicial Conference says don't quickly toss these matters into the Federal courts. The Federal courts can't keep up with the cases that are there today, especially when the Senate won't vote to confirm judges for the vacancies already existing. 
Let's not do this. And let us say that the U.S. Senate, of all places, will protect the current state process and rights of local communities and local counties and States to make their own decisions. 
Why do we want to say to our small towns that they can not decide to protect a particular area? Why do we say they should not be able to stop a building from being built next to a particular scenic spot? If they are willing to forego tax revenue by doing that, and they are willing to pay the price themselves--why do we want to say that some big developer from out of State could come in with a platoon of lawyers and endless pockets and say, `Oh, the heck with you. We know better. We can make a quick buck on that, and we will take you to Federal court if you do not let us do it"? 
Before the Congress bulldozes local and state jurisdiction, we need to ask ourselves what urgent problem is being solved by this bill that could not be solved some other way? What is so urgent that we have to step in right now and wipe out the local land use process of our towns, our cities, our counties or our States? What is such a pressing need besides the current concerns of a couple of well-financed PACs? What is the urgent concern in this country that we have to suddenly rewrite the rule books and say from the Federal Government, `you people at the local government level don't know what you are doing, and we are going to step in and take it over"? 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the fact is we have never had a hearing on this particular bill, S. 2271, not in the U.S. Senate. The fact is we do not have a report on this bill. S. 2271 was rushed to us and stuck on the calendar. It was just introduced last week. And without one second of hearings on this bill, without one word of a report, we Senators are asked to push forward and vote on it. 
I am concerned that this bill radically changes a system which resolves thousands of land use decisions each week in thousands of American communities and cities. The zoning system in this country is working well. It is helping mayors, like Mayor Giuliani in New York, clean up their communities. Yet, as Mayor Giuliani said, the efforts he has made to clean up crime and clean up porno shops and clean up a lot of other problems in New York City, could be swept aside by this legislation. 
I could show you stacks of letters from local citizens in Vermont, in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, and in many other States who are up in arms about a provision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act that overrides local and State decisions involving cellular transmission towers. That provision, and this bill, were the subject of a recent article in Governing Magazine that was aptly titled, `The National Zoning Nanny.' 
Do we really want to federalize these local decisions by booting them into Federal court? 
This bill is unwise, it is unsound, and it is unwarranted. We ought to be standing up here and defending our mayors, Governors, and our attorneys general, our towns and cities, and others in our States who understand the unintended consequences of this bill. We ought to stand up and say the people of Wyoming, Vermont, Utah, West Virginia, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Missouri, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, North Dakota, Indiana, and Washington State, as the distinguished Senator from Washington State, Mrs. Murray said, know best how to make their decisions. And these people do not need the U.S. Senate to suddenly give them some new unfunded mandate and to make them liable for lawyers fees. We ought to respect the ability of the States to make decisions about how they run their communities, to make a decision of what is going to be built next to their schools or their churches or what kind of digging will go on next to the aquifers in their towns. All of these things could be quickly put before federal courts if we were to pass this bill. 
Mr. President, in one minute, we are going to be voting. I hope we will vote not to proceed with this bill. We have never had a hearing on it. We never had a report on it. This issue is not ripe. 
Mr. President, I yield any time I may have.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is passing, as an amendment to S. 2022, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Daschle Federal-State `III' Compact for exchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes. This Compact is the product of a decade-long effort by federal and state law enforcement officials to establish a legal framework for the exchange of criminal history records for authorized noncriminal justice purposes, such as security clearances, employment or licensing background checks. 
Since 1924, the FBI has collected and maintained duplicate state and local fingerprint cards, along with arrest and disposition records. Today, the FBI has over 200 million fingerprint cards in its system. These FBI records are accessible to authorized government entities for both criminal and authorized noncriminal justice purposes. 
Maintaining duplicate files at the FBI is costly and leads to inaccuracies in the criminal history records, since follow-up disposition information from the States is often incomplete. Such a huge central database of routinely incomplete criminal history records raises significant privacy concerns. 
In addition, the FBI releases these records for noncriminal justice purposes (as authorized by Federal law), to State agencies upon request, even if the State from which the records originated or the receiving State more narrowly restricts the dissemination of such records for noncriminal justice purposes. 
The III Compact is an effort to get the FBI out of the business of holding a duplicate copy of every State and local criminal history record, and instead to keep those records at the State level. Once fully implemented, the FBI will only need to hold the Interstate Identification Index (III), consisting of the national fingerprint file and a pointer index to direct the requestor to the correct State records repository. The Compact would eliminate the necessity for duplicate records at the FBI for those States participating in the Compact. Eventually, when all the States become full participants in the Compact, the FBI's centralized files of state offender records will be discontinued and users of such records will obtain those records from the appropriate State's central repository (or from the FBI if the offender has a federal record). 
The Compact would establish both a framework for this cooperative exchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes, and create a Compact Council with representatives from the FBI and the States to monitor system operations and issue necessary rules and procedures for the integrity and accuracy of the records and compliance with privacy standards. Importantly, this Compact would not in any way expand or diminish noncriminal justice purposes for which criminal history records may be used under existing State or Federal law. 
Overall, I believe that the Compact would increase the accuracy, completeness and privacy protection for criminal history records. 
In addition, the Compact would result in important cost savings from establishing a decentralized system. Under the system envisioned by the Compact, the FBI would hold only an `index and pointer' to the records maintained at the originating State. The FBI would no longer have to maintain duplicate State records. Moreover, States would no longer have the burden and costs of submitting arrest fingerprints and charge/disposition data to the FBI for all arrests. Instead, the State would only have to submit to the FBI the fingerprints and textual identification data for a person's first arrest. 
With this system, criminal history records would be more up-to-date, or complete, because a decentralized system will keep the records closer to their point of origin in State repositories, eliminating the need for the States to keep sending updated disposition information to the FBI. To ensure further accuracy, the Compact would require requests for criminal history checks for noncriminal justice purposes to be submitted with fingerprints or some other form of positive identification, to avoid mistaken release of records. 
Furthermore, under the Compact, the newly-created Council must establish procedures to require that the most current records are requested and that when a new need arises, a new record check is conducted. 
Significantly, the newly-created Council must establish privacy enhancing procedures to ensure that requested criminal history records are only used by authorized officials for authorized purposes. Furthermore, the Compact makes clear that only the FBI and authorized representatives from the State repository may have direct access to the FBI index. The Council must also ensure that only legally appropriate information is released and, specifically, that record entries that may not be used for noncriminal justice purposes are deleted from the response. 
Thus, while the Compact would require the release of arrest records to a requesting State, the Compact would also ensure that if disposition records are available that the complete record be released. Also, the Compact would require States receiving records under the Compact to ensure that the records are disseminated in compliance with the authorized uses in that State. Consequently, under the Compact, a State that receives arrest-only information would have to give effect to disposition-only policies in that State and not release that information for noncriminal justice purposes. Thus, in my view, the impact of the Compact for the privacy and accuracy of the records would be positive. 
I am pleased to have joined with Senators Hatch and DeWine to make a number of refinements to the Compact as transmitted by to us by the Administration. Specifically, we have worked to clarify that (1) the work of the Council includes establishing standards to protect the privacy of the records; (2) sealed criminal history records are not covered or subject to release for noncriminal justice purposes under the Compact; (3) the meetings of the Council are open to the public, and (4) the Council's decisions, rules and procedures are available for public inspection and copying and published in the Federal Register. 
Commissioner Walton of the Vermont Department of Public Safety supports this Compact. He hopes that passage of the Compact will encourage Vermont to become a full participant in III for both criminal and noncriminal justice purposes, so that Vermont can `reap the benefits of cost savings and improved data quality.' The Compact is also strongly supported by the FBI and SEARCH. 
We all have an interest in making sure that the criminal history records maintained by our law enforcement agencies at the local, State and Federal levels, are complete, accurate and accessible only to authorized personnel for legally authorized purposes. This Compact is a significant step in the process of achieving that goal.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was delighted to join with Senator DeWine during National Crime Victims Rights Week in April to introduce S. 1976, the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act. I was glad to welcome Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Abraham as cosponsors. 
I have been overwhelmed by the positive response and broad support that our bill has received. I have, and will include in the record, a letter of support signed by over 50 groups, including the National Association of Developmental Disabilities Council's the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, the National Center of Hearing Disabilities, the American Association of Health and Disability, and many, many others. 
In order to move this bill through the Judiciary Committee, Senator DeWine and I are agreeing to a substitute amendment to the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act. The substitute eliminates the specific authorization for the research funding and would, instead, leave it up to the Department of Justice to allocate money for this research. Although I preferred our original bill and regret having to eliminate the specific authorization that was at the heart of our original proposal, I was prepared to accept the amendment in order to achieve progress on this important front in our efforts better to assist and serve victims of crime. 
The bill being considered by the Senate would have the Department of Justice conduct research which will increase public awareness of the victimization of individual with developmental disabilities, understanding of the nature and extent of such crimes, and examine the means by which States may establish and maintain a database on the incident of crime against individuals with disabilities. 
The need for this research is abundantly clear. Studies conducted abroad have found that individuals with disabilities are four to 10 times more likely to be a victim than individuals without disabilities. One Canadian study found that 67 percent of women with disabilities were physically or sexually assaulted as children. 
This bill also directs the Attorney General to utilize statistics gathered from studies by the Department for inclusion in the National Crime Victims Survey. 
I said in April that it is important that we focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims not only during National Crime Victims Rights Week, but throughout the year. For the past several years, I have worked hard with others to make improvements in the law and provide greater assistance to victims of crime. 
My involvement with crime victims rights began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic violence, rather than presents additional ordeals for those already victimized. 
Over the last 20 years we have made strides in recognizing crime victims' rights and providing much needed assistance. I am proud to have played a role in passage of the Victims and Witnesses Protection Act of 1983, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, and the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and the other improvements we have been able to make. 
In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Congress acted to ensure a right of allocution of victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse and to make tens of millions of dollars available to crime victims. No amount of money can make up for the harm and trauma of being the victim of crime, but we should do all that we can to see that victims are assisted, compensated and treated with dignity by the criminal justice system. 
I was the author of the Victims of Terrorism Act that passed the Senate the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and became the basis for the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act signed into law in April 1996. We are able to make funds available through supplemental grants to the States to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and mass violence, which incidents might otherwise have overwhelmed the resources of Oklahoma's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance services. 
We also filled a gap in our law for residents of the United States who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur outside the borders of the United States. In addition, we allowed greater flexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and some greater certainly so that they can know that our commitments to victims programming will not wax and wane with events. And we were able to raise the assessments on those convicted of federal crimes in order to fund the needs of crime victims. 
Last year, I cosponsored the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. That legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing the fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony during the sentencing phase of that trial. As a result of that legislation, not only were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing able to observe the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all those who were able to witness the trial and were called as witnesses to provide victim impact testimony at the sentencing phase of that trial, were able to do so. 
The Crime Victims Assistance Act, S. 1081, is legislation that I introduced this past July with Senator Kennedy. It builds upon the progress made over the last several years. It provides 
for a wholesale reform of the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. 
This bill would provide crime victims with an enhanced right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention and plea bargains, an enhanced right to a speedy trial and to be present in the courtroom throughout a trial, an enhanced right to be heard on probation revocation and to give a statement at sentencing, and the right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison. 
The Crime Victims Assistance Act would also strengthen victims' services by increasing Federal victim assistance personnel, enhancing training for State and local law enforcement and Officers of the Court, and establishing an ombudsman program for crime victims. 
With a simple majority of both Houses of Congress, the Crime Victims Assistance Act could be enacted this year and we could mark a significant and immediate difference in the lives of victims throughout our country. I hope that the Senate will turn to this important measure, as well, in our efforts to assist victims of crime. 
One unfortunate consequence of the effort to focus attention on proposals to amend the Constitution has been to dissipate efforts to enact effective victims rights legislation over the past two years. The momentum we had built over the last several years has been dissipated by this constitutional focus and exclusion of statutory reform. 
While we have made great improvements in our law enforcement and crime victims assistance programs and have made advances in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have work to do. Each year I try to help focus attention on those who work so hard every week of the year on behalf of all crime victims in crime victims' assistance and compensation programs. Their hard work and dedication have made a real difference in the lives of people who suffer from violence and abuse. 
The needs of victims of crime are many and must be addressed in a number of ways, including strengthening law enforcement and education, improving and increasing services for victims, and protecting the rights of victims. I am hopeful that in the days to come, the research directed by the Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act will serve as the foundation for the growth and improvement of services available to victims with disabilities throughout our country.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will celebrate America's independence by focusing its energy on issues that create American jobs, protect American ingenuity, and improve the lives of the American people. 
One such issue that I would like to talk about today is as American as fireworks on the 4th of July. This is our nation's patent system. Patents are the life's blood of America's industry and economic strength. 
America's patent system was established in the Constitution itself. It is no coincidence that some of those who framed our government were inventors. Both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were avid inventors. Indeed, Jefferson invented a cryptographic system that was used by the United States during World War II. 
The Founders included in our enduring Constitution as an enumerated power of the Congress, the power `To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.' (United States Constitution, Article I, Section 8.) This Constitutional provision was carefully drafted to reflect a recognition by the Founders that our patent system would have to evolve in order to serve its intended purposes. 
Congress, from its early days, implemented this constitutional prerogative. The First Congress, in its second session, passed an `Act to Promote the Progress of Useful Arts.' President Washington signed that law on April 10, 1790, and the United States Patent Office was thereby created. 
Since that time, Congress has updated the patent laws of this country to make sure that the fuel of American genius was well stoked. Indeed, on an Independence Day more than 150 years ago, on July 4, 1836, Congress reorganized the patent system, created the office of `Commissioner of Patents' and reinstated the requirement that patent applications be examined. The Act provided that if the Commissioner deemed an invention `to be sufficiently useful and important, it shall be his duty to issue a patent therefor.' 
Abraham Lincoln, the only President to be issued a patent, declared that `patents add the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.' The patent system has continued to evolve over the last century and one-half as we have adapted to changing times and advances in technology. All the while American innovators have remained at the forefront of useful invention. 
I, for one, would like to keep American innovators in the lead. Our jobs and our economic security depend on it. As we enter a new millennium, however, fewer and fewer of America's innovators feel confident that our patent system is keeping pace. 
According to the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), in the last fiscal year, the PTO received 237,045 patent applications--a 14.9 percent increase over the previous year. Inventors are rightly demanding that the PTO conduct quicker and more careful searches. After all, in today's digital world, an innovator cannot afford to wait two years for his or her patent application to be processed. And once that application has been processed, an applicant wants to know that the patent will hold up and that the patent holder will not be caught up in litigation for years attempting to defend it. 
It is for this reason that American inventors of all shapes and sizes, large and small, independent inventors and large corporations, have been pleading with Congress to improve our current patent system. They are asking us to help cut the red tape at the PTO, provide our inventors with stronger patent applications, reduce the cost of resolving patent disputes, and put an end to rules that favor foreign applicants over American applicants. What they have been asking us to do is to pass the Omnibus Patent Reform Act of 1997, S. 507. 
Who wants this bill? American innovators and businesses large and small. 
The White House Conference on Small Business Technology Chairs wrote to me on May 7, 1998 urging passage of S. 507 because, and I am quoting from their letter:  
We believe that S. 507, as amended, will lower the litigation costs for small businesses, make it easier to know what areas of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way towards giving us a more level playing field vis-a-vis our foreign competitors. We wholeheartedly support passage of the bill and appreciate the attention and support you have given to small business. 
The Chief Executives of 48 of America's largest companies wrote the Senate Majority Leader, asking him to schedule a vote on the bill before the Senate adjourns in the fall because `S. 507 makes several major improvements in U.S. patent law that will greatly benefit American companies and inventors.' 
So what has been stopping this bill? Well, one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill has been the Eagle Forum. The Senate Republican leadership should not clip the wings of technology for the benefit of the Eagle Forum. That would be no way to honor America's independence and no way to honor America's proud tradition of innovation. 
Instead, let us celebrate America's independence by helping out the millions of Americans who owe their jobs and prosperity to industries created by America's innovators and creators. The Senate should take up and pass S.507. 
I inserted into the Congressional Record on June 23, letters of support from the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National Venture Capital Association, and the 21 Century Patent Coalition.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am a member of the Sanctions Taskforce established by the Majority and Minority Leaders, and I support this bill. I want to give the President additional flexibility in his efforts to persuade the Indian and Pakistani Governments to walk back from the nuclear precipice. I think this bill represents an appropriate compromise. 
But I also want to emphasize that I am doing so because the President's waiver authority expires on March 1, 1999. I do not favor an open-ended waiver, nor do I want my support for this bill to be interpreted as a signal that the President should immediately use the authority to waive sanctions. I hope he will think long and hard before he does, and do so only if he is convinced that it could bring about a significant change in behavior of these countries. 
The United States finds itself in a difficult position. We are, after all, the only country that has ever used nuclear weapons against another country. We have also conducted thousands of nuclear tests, and we have an enormous nuclear arsenal. From the perspective of the Indians and the Pakistanis, our expressions of outrage at their recent nuclear tests may seem hypocritical. 
I for one believe the United States could do a great deal more to set an example on nuclear disarmament. We do not need to wait for the Russians before we take further steps of our own. Our overwhelming military power makes it possible for us, indeed I would say we have a responsibility, to do so. We can reduce our arsenal further without risking our own security or the security of our allies. 
But having said that, I also believe that the actions of the Indian and Pakistani Governments were at complete variance with the trend of history. Their acts were reckless and unnecessary. They contributed nothing to their defense, and they have only increased tensions and insecurity in South Asia. They have invited similar recklessness by other countries. 
It is therefore imperative that the President use whatever diplomatic means he has to encourage the Indians and Pakistanis to join the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, to enter into serious negotiations on a solution to the Kashmir problem, and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that they are not drawn into a nuclear arms race. In that regard, they need only look to the experience of the United States and the former Soviet Union to understand why it is in their interests to not start down that road. 
I want the President's diplomacy to succeed, and I support giving him the tools he needs. But I also support the sunset provision in this bill because it gives these countries ample time to demonstrate whether or not they intend to respond to these concerns. If they do not, then sanctions should be reimposed. Any country that detonates a nuclear device should expect to suffer the consequences. On the other hand, if they do respond positively then I have no doubt that the Congress will reciprocate. 
Mr. President, the avoidance of nuclear war is our country's first priority. Ever since the end of World War II we have done our utmost to avoid the use of nuclear weapons, by ourselves or by others. We have made headway with Russia on nuclear disarmament, but that process has stalled. I fully support the President's decision to go to Moscow to try to revive that process. The administration has also made progress in building international support for the Test Ban Treaty. The Indian and Pakistani tests have set that process back. This bill seeks to revive it. If we fail, we can anticipate a future with nuclear weapons bristling on every continent. That is not a legacy we want to leave. 
I commend Senators McConnell and Biden for their very effective leadership of the Taskforce that produced this legislation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Product Liability Reform Act of 1998. I understand the concerns raised by a few well-publicized cases of outsized punitive damages awards in product liability cases. In seeking to address those concerns, however, this bill simply goes too far. It overly restricts an injured person's right to seek legal redress from the makers and sellers of dangerous products, and tramples on states' rights in the process. 
In fact, this legislation could leave consumers with a more dangerous marketplace. The bill caps punitive damages at the lesser of $250,000 or twice an individual's loss for smaller businesses. This cap will allow a company to calculate with a much greater degree of certainty the economic cost of placing a dangerous product into the market. If that cost is less than the cost of the design or manufacturing changes necessary to make the product safe, companies may choose to sell the dangerous product and rely on the damages cap in this legislation to limit their losses when people are hurt and file claims. 
I am at a loss to understand the need for such drastic reform. The Senate just concluded debate on a tobacco bill that would not have occurred but for an individual's ability in the current civil justice system to recover punitive damages against the maker, in this case, of a killer product. Individual states have recovered billions of dollars in damages from the tobacco industry in the same system. Despite all of the high-minded rhetoric of the tobacco industry, the threat of punitive damages was a key factor in bringing the companies to the table. 
Mr. President, the civil justice system works. The threat of punitive damages should be preserved as a powerful deterrent to manufacturing dangerous products. Damage awards should not be a calculable, fixed business expense to be coldly measured against the consumer's welfare. 
If the concern is frivolous lawsuits, we do not need federal legislation. Federal and state court judges already have the power to dismiss such actions under Rules 12 and 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and similar state procedural rules. The Supreme Court's Daubert decision has established rigorous standards for the admissibility of expert testimony in product liability cases. 
In addition, many states already have enacted comprehensive tort reform laws of their own that include product liability provisions. If the Vermont State Legislature wants to enact restrictions on product liability lawsuits or caps on punitive damages, then they are free to do so. And the Vermont State Legislature is free to not change Vermont's civil justice system. 
And that's as it should be. The law of torts has always been the province of the states. This bill, though, would inject a federal standard into every state's negligence law and into every state's punitive damages proof threshold. The federal government should not dictate state tort law standards in any event, and particularly in this case, as states already have taken many steps to reform their own product liability laws. 
Why do we now want to pass a Federal law to override these State laws that have addressed product liability reforms? Do we in the United States Senate now know better than our state legislatures? What happened to state's rights? 
I do not believe the false threat of frivolous lawsuits justifies this bill. Instead, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. There is no product liability litigation crisis in Vermont or the rest of the country. In fact, less than one percent of new case filings in state courts are brought by injured consumers in products liability lawsuits. 
And while the bill restricts consumers' rights and imposes tort standards on states, the legislation will not apply to lawsuits involving commercial interests--what hypocrisy! While consumers may have their hands tied, businesses will be free to pursue their claims without any limitations. Because almost half of all civil litigation is commercial in nature, almost half of all civil litigation will be completely unaffected by this bill. If the problems in product liability litigation truly are serious enough to warrant handcuffing consumers and dictating tort law to the states, then businesses should be bound by this bill's restrictions as well. 
In what appears to be the height of corporate welfare, a new paragraph has been slipped into this bill that grants immunity from products liability lawsuits for a Mississippi medical products company, Baxter International, Inc. This new paragraph would exempt from products liability lawsuits any manufacturers who make the raw materials used in intravenous bags, which just happens to benefit Baxter International, Inc. 
Mr. President, the civil justice system is not perfect, but it works. This legislation would not improve the system. Rather, it will make it more difficult for consumers to fight against unsafe or dangerous products, and may result in a more dangerous marketplace overall. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when most of us think about health we think about it on a personal or local level. Perhaps a child is suffering from an ear infection or an outbreak of chicken pox has emptied the local elementary school. But when Dr. Nils Daulaire thinks about health it is from a global perspective, and I am delighted to report that Nils was recently named the next President and CEO of the National Council for International Health. 
I have known Nils for many years. He is a fellow Vermonter and a trusted friend whose advice I have valued enormously. Nils' boundless energy and devotion to helping others is an inspiration to everyone who knows him. He is as comfortable tending to a sick child in a remote village in Nepal as he is representing the United States Government in international health policy negotiations. Over the years, Nils has earned a reputation as a leading authority in the public health field. 
During his tenure as Senior Health Adviser at the Agency for International Development, Nils worked to ensure that international health is a major focus of AID's efforts worldwide. He played a central role in convening a conference of health agencies and organizations to develop a multi-year U.S. strategy to strengthen global surveillance and control of infectious disease. Nils' leadership was instrumental in the strategy that emerged from that conference, which should, over time, result in a significant reduction in the number of deaths from infectious disease. As the new head of NCIH whose membership includes over 1,000 medical professionals and organizations, Nils' continued involvement in this initiative will be critical to its success. 
The NCIH's mission to improve global health is a monumental task. I cannot think of a person more capable of leading NCIH into the next century than Nils Daulaire. He is a straight talker and he knows what he is talking about. He understands the medical issues and he understands the political issues. Once Nils begins his new job on August 1, NCIH's operations will be split between Nils in Vermont and his other capable staff in Washington. I look forward to continuing our close working relationship on infectious disease, on maternal health, and other important issues.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am gratified that the Senate finally has before it today the final language of The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Restructuring and Reform Act. I continue to support this bill, which has been making its way through the Congress for many months and which is long overdue. I commend Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for their conscientious work on this legislation. I also commend Senator Grassley and Senator Kerrey for introducing the original IRS reform bill, of which I am a cosponsor. 
I have heard from many Vermonters who support the reining in of the IRS. They want the IRS to be more responsive to their questions and more respectful of their rights, and that is exactly what they deserve from their government. I will be pleased to return home and tell Vermonters that the Senate has acted in their interests and passed legislation that will make the IRS more responsive to the average taxpayer and that gives the average taxpayer more rights when dealing with the IRS. 
This bipartisan legislation will bring many significant reforms into reality, including: 
Burden of Proof. The burden of proof is on the IRS in all court cases for tax years beginning after the date of enactment of this bill. 
Innocent Spouse Relief. Innocent spouses and former spouses will no longer be held responsible for tax liabilities incurred by the other spouse. 
Interest and Penalties. If the IRS fails to notify the taxpayer of a delinquency within 18 months, the taxpayer will not be held responsible for penalties and interest accrued during that time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Democratic leader can yield for a question, I ask the Senator from South Dakota--and I am looking around the floor, and I see a number of Senators on the floor. I see only two who have served here longer than I. I ask my question in the form of that context. 
In the 24 years I have been here, Democrats have been twice in the majority, twice in the minority. Thus, the Republicans twice in the minority and twice in the majority. Would it not be the experience of the Senator from South Dakota, as it has been mine, that no matter which party was in the majority, the Senate and the Senate rules and those who have led the Senate have always reflected the need of the Senate rules to protect both sides, both the majority and the minority, so that the United States of America would know that there was a full debate on real issues where all voices were heard, not just the voice maybe of temporarily the majority, but all voices would be heard? 
And would it not be the experience of the Senator from South Dakota that this procedure, something I have not seen in my 24 years here, this procedure is said to make sure there will not be a vote where all Americans are heard, will make sure there is not a debate where all Americans are heard, but will be done in such a way that only one segment of our country will be heard? Will that not be the experience of the Senator from South Dakota?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I noticed we were in a quorum call. I was going to mention a situation that we have today that we may want to think about as we consider moving to proceed. Tonight much of America is going to observe a midsummer tradition, the major league baseball All-Star Game. 
A number of teams are having outstanding seasons, including the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres. Adding special interest to this season is the possibility that the single-season records for home runs and runs batted in may be broken. 
Now, when Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle were chasing the home run record in 1961, they finished the first half of the season at 33 and 28 homers, respectively. At this year's All-Star break, Mark McGwire already has 37 homers, Ken Griffey, Jr., 35, and Sammy Sosa 33, as they head toward Maris' record of 61. 
Some may recall from baseball history what Babe Ruth said when he was asked about his $80,000 contract for 1930--it was 10 years before I was born--and at the time it was the highest salary ever agreed to be paid to a baseball player. In a response to a reporter's comment that he was earning more money than the President of the United States, the Babe remarked, `Why not? I had a better year than he did.' 
So, too, when the American people consider how the Senate is meeting its responsibilities with respect to judicial vacancies, we are going to have to conclude that Mark McGwire is having a better year than the Senate. In light of the All-Star Game being played tonight, let us compare the Senate's pace in confirming much-needed Federal judges to Mark McGwire's home run pace. The Senate got off to an early lead this year. From January through the end of April, the Senate confirmed 22 judges. The Senate's pace, though, slowed in May. 
We have not been able to generate any real momentum through the spring and early summer. The number of Federal judges confirmed all year is only 33. 
Of course, the Senate's early lead on McGwire started to vanish once the baseball season started on March 31, which happens to be my birthday. It took `Big Mac' only 10 weeks to match the Senate's total. By June 8 he had caught and passed the Senate's total and he has been looking back at us ever since. McGwire is on a pace to shatter Maris' record and total 70 home runs in a single season. 
You can see on my chart: July--judges confirmed by the Senate, 33; McGwire's home runs, 37; October projections--for the Senate only 51; but for McGwire, 70. 
Unfortunately, the Senate is nowhere near a record pace. As recently as 1994--coincidentally, the last year in which the Senate majority was Democrats--the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the Republican Senate three years to reach the century mark and to do what a Democratic Senate was able to achieve in a single session. 
As Chief Justice Rehnquist--and I have no idea if like Justice Blackmun, he is a baseball fan or not--but he correctly observed: `The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.' 
This chart also shows you where the Senate is today as compared to our total of judges confirmed in 1994, when we had confirmed 44 judges in July on our way to 101 confirmations. That out paced even Mark McGwire. Here again are our October projections: Judges confirmed at the current pace, probably around 51. I think Mark McGwire is on a pace to get 70. And, of course, the Congress, when last controlled by the Democrats confirmed 101. 
I hope that some think about this when we are watching the All-Star Game tonight. Would not the Senate be more productive if we could do just a little more and get a bit closer to the pace being set by some of our favorite baseball players? We are supposed to be the stars of the legislative firmament, but we certainly aren't All-Stars when it comes to this. 
We began this year with the criticism of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court ringing in our ears: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' 
Both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have had to cancel hearings over the past couple of years due to judicial vacancies. Chief Judge Winter of the Second Circuit has had to declare a circuit emergency and to proceed with only one circuit judge on their three-judge panels. 
In response to the criticism of the Chief Justice, the Republican leadership has argued that the Senate is on a steady course and making steady progress. So was the Titanic as it headed towards the icebergs. It was only in the last 9 weeks of the last session that the Senate achieved any real progress. In that period, in conjunction with the President's national radio address on the crisis, the Senate confirmed 27 judges in 9 weeks. 
I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace. Instead, we confirmed only 33 judicial nominees in 18 weeks in session instead of the 54 we would have confirmed if we had maintained last year's pace. 
I have reissued my challenge for the last 10 weeks in session, which are all that remain to the Senate this entire year. We can confirm another 30 nominees by the end of the session if the Senate will work at the pace it achieved at the end of last year. 
We have held only seven judicial nomination hearings all year. I recall in 1994, the most recent year in which the Democrats constituted the majority, the Judiciary Committee held 25 judicial confirmation hearings, including hearings to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, which automatically take far, far more time than others. That is 25 hearings as compared with seven. 
They had no vacancy on the Supreme Court this year, but nine 
of the current nominees for the courts of appeals need their hearings and they need them promptly. We have 25 currently pending nominees to the district courts, and only one of those is less than 30 days old. 
We should not tolerate upwards of 73 vacancies in the Federal courts, with more on the horizon. Almost one in 10 judgeships remains unfilled, and from the looks of things, they are going to remain unfilled into the future. The Judiciary Committee needs to do a better job, and the Senate needs to proceed more promptly and to consider nominees reported to it. 
The nomination held the longest on the Senate calendar is Judge Sonia Sotomayor for a critical vacancy in the Second Circuit. I have already mentioned that in that circuit, which is my own, the Chief Judge has declared an emergency situation. Chief Judge Winter recently issued his annual report in which he notes that the court now has the greatest backlog it ever had. 
Ironically, it was Judge Sotomayor who issued a key decision in 1995 that brought an end to the work stoppage in major league baseball. How wonderful it would be if today, at the time of this year's All-Star Game, the Senate would end its work stoppage with respect to her nomination and proceed to consider and confirm her. 
This brings me back to the All-Star Game, Mr. President. We will applaud these outstanding players and we will cheer the baseball teams represented. As a New Englander, I historically applaud the Red Sox, no matter how they do--although they had a pretty good first half. Every one of us has favorite players and teams. We stick with them even when they fall behind. But none of these teams has fallen as far behind where they should be as the U.S. Senate has, none has been so disappointing. 
Let us try harder. Let us try to confirm at least as many judges as Mark McGwire is going to hit home runs. If we do not want to use the Constitution as an inspiration, if we do not want to use judicial vacancies and the harm they cause as an inspiration, if we do not want to use the potential collapse of the Federal judicial system as an inspiration, maybe some can take inspiration from America's pastime and say, `If Mark McGwire can do it, so can the U.S. Senate.' 
We have not yet, but hope springs eternal. Let us take his effort and commitment as inspiration. Let us not keep hitting foul balls. Let the Senate hit a home run now and then. It would be a home run for the American people if the Senate stopped holding the Federal judiciary hostage. We should help fill these vacancies. Let's do it. 
We have 45 judicial nominations pending, some of whom were first received over three years ago. There are currently nine qualified nominees on the Senate calendar who have been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. 
In addition, there are 36 nominees pending before the Judiciary Committee and more nominees are being received from the President every week. I hope that the Committee will schedule prompt hearings for each of the judicial nominees currently pending in Committee and for the nominees we expect to be receiving over the next several weeks so that they may have an opportunity to be considered by the Committee and confirmed by the Senate. 
At the conclusion of the debate on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as 23 Republicans were preparing to vote against that exceptionally well-qualified nominee whose confirmation had been delayed 18 months, Senator Hatch said `playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it.' I agree with him. I look forward to a return to the days when judicial nominations are treated with the respect and attention that they deserve. 
I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky nominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1994 and 1995 judicial nominees took on average 86 or 87 days from nomination to confirmation. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 days on average. Some would discount that number because it was a presidential election year, but even they cannot 
ignore that it shattered the previous record. 
Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and this in the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. The average time from nomination to confirmation is now over 260 days. That is three times the time it took before this partisan slowdown began in earnest. 
The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the number of judicial vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' 
I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil this constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. 
The Republican Senate leadership seems to be operating under several false assumptions. As recently as June 22, they have stated that there is no problem with the scores of longstanding judicial vacancies because the federal judiciary has 767 active judges, which are more than the number of active judges sitting during the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
Unfortunately, their statement fails to consider the enormous growth in the workload of the federal courts over the last two decades. The federal judiciary's workload was at least 60 percent lower than it is today when the Reagan-Bush administrations took office. The federal court's criminal docket alone is up from 28,921 cases in 1980 to 50,363 last year. That is an increase of over 70 percent in the criminal case filings in the federal courts. 
Moreover, if the Republicans have their way, this Congress will add more and more cases to the federal courts' workload. Among their priorities are a products liability bill, a so-called `takings' bill and a version of a juvenile crime bill that each federalizes huge portions of what have traditionally been cases handled through state courts. 
In recognition of the growing federal court workload, Congress authorized an additional 85 authorized judgeships back in 1984. The vacancies were then filed without delay by Congress, including the 100th Congress in which there was a Democratic majority. Indeed, in 1987 and 1988, the last two years of the Reagan administration, a Democratic Senate confirmed 96 judges, leaving only 23 vacancies at the end of that Congress. 
In 1990, a Democratic Congress created 85 additional judgeships during the Bush administration. That brought an anomalous spike in the vacancy numbers. During the 102nd Congress, in 1991 and 1992, the last two years of the Bush administration, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of a Democrat, held 30 confirmation hearings and the Democratic Senate confirmed 124 Bush nominees to the federal bench. In fact, in 1992, during President Bush's last year in office a Democratic Senate confirmed 66 of his nominations. 
Thus, during the Reagan and Bush years, both Democratic and Republican Senates not only promptly considered and confirmed judges but also authorized 167 new judgeships in response to the increasing workload of the federal judiciary. Authorized judgeships have increased in number by 25 percent since 1980 while the workload of the federal courts has grown by over 60 percent during the same period. That is why the prolonged vacancies being perpetuated by delays in the confirmation process are creating such strains within the federal courts. 
Presidents Reagan and Bush were able to appoint 579 federal judges, including 291 confirmed by a Democratic Senate from 1987 through 1992. In the last two years of the Bush administration, 
1991 and 1992, a Democratic Senate held 30 hearings and confirmed 124 judges nominated by a President of the other party, with 66 coming in 1992, a presidential election year. 
When Republicans note that President Clinton has appointed 273 federal judges over the past six years, they invariably fail to mention that 129 of these nominees were confirmed by a Democratic Senate in 1993 and 1994. Over the past four years, Republican have confirmed a total of fewer than 145 federal judges, during a time in which the judicial vacancy rate has continued to hover between 70 and 110 longstanding vacancies and the workload of federal courts continues to grow. 
So unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed to newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies crisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to consider nominees to longstanding vacancies. 
Republicans also suggest that maintaining as many as 60 vacancies is `virtually full employment' on the federal bench. I disagree. In the early and mid-1980's, vacancies were between 25 and 34 at the beginning of each session of Congress. By the fall of 1983, the vacancies for the entire federal judiciary had been reduced to only 16. 
With attrition and the 85 new judgeships created in 1984, vacancies reached 123 at the beginning of President Reagan's second term, but those vacancies were reduced to only 33 within two years, by the fall of 1986. A Democratic Senate in 1987 and 1988 reduced the vacancies still further to only 23 at the end of the 100th Congress. 
It was not until the additional judges were created in 1990 that the next significant spike in vacancies occurred and then, again, the Democratic Senate responsibly set about the task of helping fill those vacancies with qualified nominees. Although President Bush was notoriously slow to nominate, the Democratic Senate confirmed 124 nominees in President Bush's last two years and cut the vacancies in half. 
Republicans also contend, erroneously, that the Clinton administration has stated that 63 vacancies is acceptable and `virtually full employment.' They misinterpret a press release from October 1994. That press release was pointing out that if the Senate had proceeded to confirm the 14 nominees then on the Senate calendar it would have brought the total judges confirmed during President Clinton's first two years to over 140 and would have reduced the judicial vacancy rate to 4.7 percent, which the press release then proceeded to compare to a favorable unemployment rate of under 5 percent. 
This was not a statement of administration position or even a policy statement but a poorly designed press release that included an ill-conceived. Job vacancy rates and unemployment rates are not comparable. Judicial vacancy rates have significance beyond general unemployment statistics. 
When I learned that some Republicans had for partisan purposes seized upon this press release, taken it out of context, ignored what the press release actually said and were manipulating it into a misstatement of Clinton administration policy, I asked the Attorney General, in 1997, whether there was any level or percentage of judicial vacancies that the administration considered acceptable or equal to `full employment.' 
The Department responded:  
There is no level or percentage of vacancies that justifies a slow down in the Senate on the confirmation of nominees for judicial positions. While the Department did once, in the fall of 1994, characterize a 4.7 percent vacancy rate in the federal judiciary as the equivalent of the Department of Labor `full employment' standard, that characterization was intended simply to emphasize the hard work and productivity of the Administration and the Senate in reducing the extraordinary number of vacancies in the federal Article III judiciary in 1993 and 1994. Of course, there is a certain small vacancy rate, due to retirements and deaths and the time required by the appointment process, that will always exist. The current vacancy rate is 11.3 percent. It did reach 12 percent this past summer. The President and the Senate should continually be working diligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench. 
At no time has the Clinton administration stated that it believes that 60 vacancies on the federal bench is acceptable or a virtually full federal bench. Only Republicans have expressed that opinion. As the Department noted last year, the Senate should be `working diligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.' 
With respect to the question of vacancies, it is also important to note that in 1997 the Judiciary Conference of the United States requested an additional 53 judgeships be created and the Republican Congress has refused to consider that workload justified request. My bill to meet that request, S.678, the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, has received no attention since I introduced it over a year ago. Had those additional judgeships been created, as they were in 1984 and 1990 under Republican Presidents, current judicial vacancies would number 123 and total almost 14 percent of the federal judiciary. 
I hope that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate will proceed to consider and confirm judicial nominees more promptly and without the months of delay that now accompany so many nominations. I hope the Committee will not delay in scheduling the additional hearings we need to hold to consider the fine men and women whom the President has nominated to fill these important positions. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a great appreciation for the fine work Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond have put into crafting this difficult bill. The VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill in particular deals with many tough issues and competing demands. One of the smaller agencies which I would like to bring attention to today is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
Just a few weeks ago FEMA invited Lamoille County in Vermont to become a part of Project Impact, FEMA's pre-disaster mitigation program. This is a program that is partnering with communities, and the private sector, to make communities more resistant to natural disaster. 
The importance of this kind of pre-disaster planning was driven home this past weekend as Lamoille, along with Addison, Chittenden, Franklin, Orange, Rutland, Washington, and Windsor Counties in Vermont were again devastated by severe storms and flooding. On June 30th, the President declared these areas in Vermont a major disaster. I toured the area with FEMA officials last week and, thanks to the hard work and spirit of the people of Vermont, the local public safety forces and FEMA, those communities are beginning to recover. Project Impact could help counties like Lamoille take steps to reduce the costs and public health risks of these kinds of disasters in the future.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, from its origins as a U.S.-based research vehicle, the Internet has matured into a democratic, international medium for communication, commerce and education. As the Internet evolves, the traditional means of organizing its technical functions such as the Domain Name System (DNS) need to evolve as well. 
It is for this reason, in part, that I viewed S.1609, legislation to authorize the Next Generation Internet (NGI) program, as the appropriate vehicle for my domain name amendment. This amendment is based on S.1727, legislation I introduced on March 6 to authorize the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects on trademark and intellectual property rights holders of adding new generic top level domain names (gTLDs), and related dispute resolution procedures. 
At the outset, I would like to thank Senator Ashcroft, who is a cosponsor of this domain name amendment to S. 1609 as well as a cosponsor of my original domain name bill, S.1727. I would also like to thank Senators Rockefeller, Frist, Hollings and McCain who enabled this domain name amendment to be considered along with S.1609. 
On today's Internet, the domain name system (DNS) works through a hierarchy of names. At the top of this hierarchy are a set of Top Level Domains that can be classified into two categories: generic Top Level Domains (gTLD), such as `.gov,' `.net,' `.com,' `.edu,' `.org,' `.int,' and `.mil,' and the country code Top Level Domain names, such as `.us' and `.uk'. Before each TLD suffix, is a Second Level Domain name. 
Since the Internet is an outgrowth of U.S. government investments carried out under agreements with U.S. agencies, major components of the DNS are still performed by or subject to agreements with U.S. agencies. Examples include assignments of numerical addresses to Internet users, management of the system of registering names for Internet users, operation of the root server system, and protocol assignment. 
For the past five years, a company based in Herndon, Virginia, named Network Solutions, Inc., has served under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation as the exclusive registry of all second level domain names in several of the gTLDs (e.g., .com, .net, .org, and .edu). This contract ended in March 1998, but the Federal Government has exercised an optional ramp-down period that is scheduled to expire in September 1998. With this date quickly approaching, many of us have been concerned about what would happen at the end of that company's exclusive contract. Simply put, how will we avoid chaos on the Internet and the potential risk of multiple registrations of the same domain name for different computers? 
On January 30, 1998, the Commerce Department released a `Green Paper', or discussion draft, entitled A Proposal to Improve Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses, proposing privatization of the management of the DNS through the creation of a new, not-for-profit corporation. The Green Paper suggested that during the period of transition to this new, not-for-profit corporation, the U.S. Government, in cooperation with IANA, would undertake a process to add up to five new gTLDs to the DNS. 
Although adding new gTLDs, as the Green Paper proposed, would allow more competition and more individuals and businesses to obtain addresses that more closely reflect their names and functions, I was concerned as were many businesses, that the increase in gTLDs would make the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or dilution more difficult. In addition, increasing the number of gTLDs without an efficient dispute resolution mechanism had the potential of fueling litigation and the threat of litigation, with an overall chilling effect on the choice and use of domain names. 
The Green Paper properly raised the important questions of how to protect consumers' interests in locating the brand or vendor of their choice on the Internet without being deceived or confused, how to protect companies from having their brand equity diluted in an electronic environment, and how to resolve disputes efficiently and inexpensively. It did not, however, answer these complex and important questions. Dictating the introduction of new gTLDs without analyzing the impact that these new gTLDs would have on trademark and intellectual property rights holders and related dispute resolution procedures seemed like putting the cart before the horse. 
The bill that I introduced, S. 1727, was intended to get the horse back in front of the cart. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to request the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects on trademark and intellectual property rights holders of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures. The study shall assess and, as appropriate, make recommendations for policy, practice, or legislative changes regarding:

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Hatch has now decided to join with me in including on this measure an amendment that will reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act for five years. This amendment complements Senator Hatch's bill to authorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, S.2073, because it provides additional assistance to some of the most vulnerable children in our country--children and teenagers who have run away or become homeless. 
In 1996, I introduced legislation with Senator Simon similar to this amendment. Unfortunately, that bill was never passed by the Judiciary Committee and so the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act has not been authorized for over two years. I think it is time for the Senate to remedy this situation and that is why I proposed this amendment to Senator Hatch's bill. I had also hoped to reauthorize the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs, commonly known as the Title V program, as well as two anti-drug abuse programs for runaway and homeless youth and gang-affiliated teenagers. But, due to objections from the Republican side of the aisle, I have not been able to include reauthorization for those worthwhile programs in this amendment. That is unfortunate. As a former prosecuter I know these programs could cut drug abuse. 
Reauthorizing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act for five more years is the first step in assuring local community programs that they will have the additional resources they need to assist the growing number of homeless and runaway youth in the U.S. This program distributes funding to local community programs which are on the front lines assisting the approximately 1.3 million children and youth each year who are homeless or have left their families for a variety of reasons. This is the sort of program that studies have found to be an effective and efficient use of limited federal dollars. 
The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs assist some of our nation's neediest children--those who lack a roof over their heads. Many of the beneficiaries of these programs have either fled or been kicked out of their family homes due to serious family conflicts or other problems. These programs assist children facing a variety of circumstances and provide funding for shelters and crisis intervention services, transitional living arrangements and outreach to teens who are living on the streets. 
The Basic Center grants for housing and crisis services for runaway and homeless children are awarded to each State, based on juvenile population, with a minimum grant of $100,000 currently awarded to smaller States, such as Vermont. Effective community-based programs around the country can also apply directly for the funds made available for the Transitional Living Program and the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grants. The Transitional Living Program grants are used to provide longer term housing to homeless teens age 16 to 21, and to help these teenagers become more self-sufficient. The Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach Program also targets teens who have engaged in or are at risk of engaging in high risk behaviors while living on the street. 
Vermont's Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth and the Spectrum Youth and Family Services in Burlington, Vermont, have developed very comprehensive and effective programs to assist both teens who are learning to be self-sufficient and those who are struggling to survive on the streets. As such, Vermont programs have been successful in applying for these two specialized programs and have been on the forefront of developing and improving the services available to runaway and homeless youth. 
This amendment, which reauthorizes all three Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs, is intended to recognize the important work of these programs in Vermont, as well as the many, many others across the U.S. that are working effectively with runaway and homeless youth and their families. 
Our amendment also reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act Rural Demonstration Projects for an additional five years. This program provides extra assistance to States with rural juvenile populations. Programs serving runaway and homeless youth have found that those in rural areas are particularly difficult to reach and serve effectively. Runaway and homeless youth programs in rural areas, such as those in Utah and Vermont, need additional assistance and have special needs. 
For those who do not think rural areas have significant numbers of runaway youth, I note that in fiscal year 1997, the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth served 987 young people in its programs in 10 counties. Spectrum Youth and Family Services served an additional 259 at its center and over 2,000 through its street outreach services and drop-in center in Burlington. These numbers have been increasing rapidly over the past few years with a 154 percent increase in the number of youth served by the Vermont Coalition between 1992 and 1997. An area of special concern is the increasing number of young people who are being `pushed' out of their homes--those numbers increased 263 percent between 1993 and 1997 in Vermont. This is in addition to the hundreds of children each year who find themselves homeless or who have run away from home. 
The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act does more than shelter these children in need. As the National Network for Youth stressed in their letter in support of my amendment, the Act's programs `provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the country.' This Act also ensures that these children and their families have access to important services, such as individual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources to help these young people and their families get back on track. 
As a result of this multi-pronged approach to helping runaway and homeless youth, the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth was able to establish 85 percent of the youth served in 1997 in a `positive living situation' by the end of the year. Of these 800 young people, 54 percent returned home and another 17 percent went to live with a relative or friend. 
The Vermont Coalition should be applauded for these fine results and I believe the best way to do that is to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Act for five more years, so programs like these in Vermont have some greater financial security in the future.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain the pace it set in the last weeks of the last session in which it confirmed 27 judicial nominees in 9 weeks. Instead, the Senate has confirmed only 31 nominees so far this year--instead of the 54 it should have if it had maintained last year's pace. 
I reissue my challenge for the remaining 10 weeks of this session: The Republican Senate can confirm another 30 nominees by the end of the session if it will just work at the pace it achieved in connection with the President's radio address last year. 
I thank the Majority Leader for calling up the nominations of Howard Matz and Victoria Roberts. With their confirmations, and I do believe that they should and will be confirmed, the Senate will have acted on only 33 federal judges at a time in which the federal judiciary has experienced 103 vacancies, many of longstanding duration. Indeed, Ms. Roberts would fill a judiciary emergency vacancy. We will have 45 judicial nominations still pending before the Senate or the Judiciary Committee, some which were first received over three years ago. 
There are currently nine other qualified nominees on the Senate calendar having been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. I deeply regret that the entire Senate Executive Calendar is not being cleared and the Senate is not being given the opportunity to vote on all 11 nominees awaiting Senate action. 
The nomination held up the longest is that of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to fill a critical vacancy on the Second Circuit, a Circuit whose Chief Judge has declared an emergency situation, canceled hearings and taken the extraordinary step of proceeding with 3-judge panels including only one Second Circuit judge. Chief Judge Winter recently issued his annual report in which he notes that the Circuit now has the greatest backlog it has ever had, due to the multiple vacancies that have plagued that court. 
In addition, there are 36 nominees pending before the Committee and more nominees being received from the President every week. I hope that the Committee will schedule prompt hearings for each of the judicial nominees currently pending in Committee and the nominees we expect to be receiving over the next several weeks so that they may have an opportunity to be considered by the Committee and confirmed by the Senate. At the rate of six nominees a hearing, the Committee needs to schedule at least six more hearings this summer for currently pending nominees. 
The Senate continues to tolerate more than 70 vacancies in the federal courts with another 11 on the horizon--almost one in 10 judgeships remains unfilled, and, from the looks of things, will remain unfilled into the future unless the Judiciary Committee does a better job and the Senate proceeds promptly to consider nominees reported to it. 
We have held only seven judicial nominations confirmation hearing all year. I recall in 1994--the most recent year in which the Democrats constituted the majority--when the Judiciary Committee held 25 judicial confirmation hearings, including hearings to confirm a Supreme Court Justice. 
Nine currently pending nominees for the Courts of Appeals need their hearings and need them promptly if they are to be considered and confirmed this year, only three of those were received in the last 60 days. We have 25 currently pending nominees to the District Courts and only four of those were received in the last 30 days. 
Unlike earlier days in the Senate when nominees were not made to wait for weeks and months on the Senate calendar before they could be considered, that is now becoming the rule. Margaret Morrow spent 244 days on the calendar. Patrick McCuskey and Michael McCuskey each spent 144 days on the calendar. The average time on the calendar has gone from a day or two to over 44 days. 
I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky nominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1994 and 1995 judicial nominees took on average 86 or 87 days from nomination to confirmation. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 days on average. Some would discount that number because it was a presidential election year, but even they cannot ignore that it shattered the previous record. Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and this is the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200 day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. As we begin the day the average time from nomination to confirmation is over 250 days. That is three times the time it took before this slowdown began in earnest. 
During the entire four years of the Bush Administration there were only three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as long as 9 months before being 
confirmed and none took as long as a year. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more than 9 months before a final favorable vote and 9 of those 10 extended over a year to a year and one-half. Of the judges confirmed so far this year, Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, and Victoria Roberts will have taken 11 months. An additional nine confirmation this year took more than 200 days. 
Last year the President sent us 79 judicial nominations but the Senate completed action on fewer than half of them. The percentage of judicial nominees confirmed over the course of last year was lower than for any Congress over the last three decades and, possibly, at any time in our history. 
Left pending were 42 judicial nominees, including 11 who were first nominated in 1995 and 1996, and 21 to fill judicial emergencies. Still pending before the Senate are four nominees first nominated in 1995 and two more first nominated in 1996. There are still eight nominations pending from 1997. 
Unfortunately, over the last three years, the Senate has barely matched the one-year total of judges confirmed in 1994 when we were on course to end the vacancy gap. We have not yet made up for attrition over the last two years. I observed at our last nominations hearing that we are not even keeping up with Mark McGwire, the St. Louis Cardinal slugger. In the three months of the baseball season leading up to the All Star game, he has hit 35 home runs. The Senate has had two additional months and confirmed only 33 judges. 
I recall in 1992, the last year of President Bush's Administration, the Senate, with a Democratic majority in a presidential election year confirmed 63 judicial nominations. Since obtaining their majority in the 1994 election, the current Republican majority has not achieved that number of confirmation in any year. Indeed in the presidential election year of 1996, the Senate confirmed only 17 judges and none for the courts of appeals. 
The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the number of judicial vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to have the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfill this constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. 
The numerous, longstanding vacancies in some courts are harming the federal administration of justice. The people in these districts and circuits need additional federal judges. Indeed the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to filling the current vacancies, the Congress should authorize 53 additional judgeships throughout the country, as set forth in S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act that I introduced in May 1997. That indicates that the work demands of the federal judiciary justify 133 additional judges. There is a clamor for us to fill these vacancies and there is harm by the Senate's delay and failure to do so. 
The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly declared in his 1997 Year End Report: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' We have had hearings canceled by both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit due to judicial vacancies. Must we wait for the administration of justice to fail before the Senate will act on the other 45 judicial nominees pending before us? I hope not. 
In his most recent report on the judiciary the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.' He went on to note: `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.' 
I hope that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate will proceed to consider and confirm judicial nominees more promptly and without the months of delay that now accompany so many nominations. I hope the Committee will not delay in scheduling the additional hearings we need to hold to consider the fine men and women whom the President has nominated to fill these important positions. 
Mr. President, Howard Matz, I am glad to see, was confirmed. He was nominated last October, reported by the committee on April 2. 
I thank the majority leader for bringing this up and getting it concluded. Senator Boxer of California showed enormous perseverance and determination in moving this forward. I commend her and her choice. I note that he was confirmed by unanimous vote, 85-0. 
Victoria Roberts' nomination has been on the calendar 1 month, pending 11 months. Senator Levin has been very strongly supportive of her, and I believe that also was a unanimous confirmation. I commend the Senators involved, and I commend the majority leader.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment with my colleague and friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. Recently, I was dismayed to learn that the Vermont Army National Guard is programmed to receive yet another cut in its full-time manning. nearly all of us take pride in supporting our state National Guard units. The Guard is a critical state asset when we experience natural disasters and other state emergencies. The Guard offers professional opportunities and education for our young constituents. Perhaps most importantly, the Guard is available in case our nation ever finds itself at war. Fully 58% of our Army's combat forces are located in the National Guard, and an Army Guard combat unit can do the same job as its active duty counterpart for less than half the cost. But all these benefits are wasted if we do not provide enough resources for our Guard to train, and enough full-time personnel so that our Guardsmen can take full advantage of the limited time they spend in uniform. 
For many years now, the Army has been giving some Guard units more resources than others. The allocation model that the Army uses is based on which units would be called to fight first. That is fine in principle, but in practice the resources that have been given to lower priority units have been insufficient. For example, in recent years the Vermont Guard's 86th Brigade has been receiving about 55% of its full time manning requirements. These are the men and women who prepare for each month's drill weekend, maintain and fix equipment, recruit new soldiers from the community, and do all the other tasks that need to be done during the month. Higher priority Guard units have been receiving 70 to 75 percent of their full time manning requirements. Although 55 percent was not sufficient, it has been enough for the 86th brigade. They recently were noted for the fact that they qualified one of their tank battalions on the regular Army's tough Tank Table 12 live-fire test. The Vermonters were only the second unit in the country to achieve this honor, the first being an enhanced unit from Idaho. 
That is why I was so disturbed that the Army was set to cut Vermont's full-time support down to between 30 and 34 percent, according to a letter I received from Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army Jayson Spiegal on March 3 of this year. At that level of funding, I have been told that Vermont would have to close some of its armories because it would not have enough funds to keep two soldiers in each armory. Of course, I am worried about my own state, which has one of the oldest militia traditions dating back to Benedict Arnold's Green Mountain Boys of Revolutionary War fame. But there are eight other National Guard combat divisions spread across the country, and I want to inform my colleagues that each of those units is in danger of suffering a death of a thousand cuts by a lack of resources. 
The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee have accepted this amendment from Senator Jeffords and myself which requires that the Head of the Guard Bureau provide a report to the four defense committees of Congress to ensure that states with a large number of lower-priority National Guard units are not being disproportionately impacted by full-time manning reductions. 
Mr. President, I want to close by thanking Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin for accommodating me and my colleague from Vermont on this amendment. Their expertise and hard work for our nation's defenses are appreciated by all of us in this body.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the United States Supreme Court held the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional. I voted against that Act when it was considered by the Senate and joined the senior Senator from West Virginia and others in warning giving the President, any President, line item veto authority would result in a dramatic shift in power from the legislative branch to the executive branch that was inconsistent with the constitutional principles of separation of powers. We warned that this shift in power that would damage our fundamental principle of majority rule, encourage horse trading between Members of Congress and the President, and not reduce the deficit in any meaningful way. Unfortunately, all of those warnings have come true. 
In 1997 I called upon Congress to admit its mistake and repeal this unconstitutional Act before the courts struck it down. Congress was given a second opportunity to correct its ill-considered action when the Supreme Court dismissed, on the limited ground of lack of standing, the challenge brought by Senator Byrd. In that case, Byrd v. Raines, District Judge Jackson had ruled that the Act violated the Constitution. 
Having failed to do its job properly, the majority in Congress is now confronted with a Supreme Court that was forced to do the Congress' job. Consistent with its judicial power under the Constitution, the Supreme Court has once again had to preserve the Constitution from legislative attack. As it did when it defended the First Amendment from being undermined by the so-called Communications Decency Act, and when it defended federalism against the encroachment of the Brady Act, here again the Supreme Court has been called upon to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. As a Senator who voted against these measures in spite of their momentary popularity, and as a Vermonter who cherishes the Constitution and the freedoms that it guarantees, I thank the Court for its service. 
I have long been concerned that the line item veto encourages minority rule by allowing a presidential item veto to stand with the support of only 34 Senators or 146 Representatives. That is not majority rule. Those anti-democratic super-majority requirements are fundamentally at odds with the principles underlying legislative action. 
Our Founders rejected such super-majority requirements on matters within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described super-majority requirements as a `poison' that serves `to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.' Such super-majority requirements reflect a basic distrust not just of Congress, but of the electorate itself. 
In addition, these super-majority requirements hurt small states, like my home State of Vermont, by upping the ante for those who dare take on the President. Under the line item veto, Members from small states have to convince two-thirds of each House to override the President's veto for the sake of a project. With Vermont having only one representative in the House, why would other Members risk the President's wrath to help us with a vetoed project? It is truly a task for Hercules to override a veto. Just look at the record--of the more than 2,500 Presidential vetoes in our history, Congress has been able to override 105. 
As the senior Senator from West Virginia has so forcefully argued, we should tread carefully when expanding the fiscal powers of the presidency. The line item veto would have weakened one of the fundamental checks and balances that form the separation of powers under our Constitution. The line item veto would have handed over the power of the purse to the President. 
I have heard the howls of some of my colleagues who lost worthy appropriations since the approval of the line item veto. And what if the President makes a mistake by line item vetoing a worthy project? The Administration even admitted that it mistakenly vetoed some projects. Do Senators trust the bureaucrats over at the Office of Management and Budget to decide, within a few short days, which projects are deserving and which are not? Is that consistent with the Founders' vision? 
I was born and raised in Vermont and go home almost every weekend. I am confident that I have a better sense of Vermont than someone who thinks Vermont is an avenue that lies somewhere between K and L streets in northwest Washington, D.C. 
Let us keep the power of the purse with Congress--where it belongs. As the Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I am frequently called upon to visit emerging democracies. I often hear praise of our system of checks and balances and, in particular, the genius of having the power to spend reside in the legislative branch, not the executive. Many officials from new democracies believe that a legislature's power over the purse is the best weapon to fight the tyranny of a dictatorship. They have been there. They know. And it has proven to be so historically. 
In his concurring opinion today in Clinton v. City of New York, Justice Kennedy noted:  
Separation of powers helps to ensure the ability of each branch to be vigorous in asserting its proper authority. . . . By increasing the power of the President beyond what the Framers envisioned, the statute compromises the political liberty of our citizens, liberty which the separation of powers seeks to secure. 
As I said in the Senate debate on the Line Item Veto Act and in Senate debate on proposals to amend the Constitution with a balanced budget amendment, the Constitution is as 
good a law as has been written. That is why it has survived as the supreme law of the land with so few alterations throughout the last 200 years. It has contributed to our success as a nation by binding us together, rather than tearing us apart. 
It contains the Great Compromise that allowed small states and large states to join together in a spirit of mutual accommodation and respect. It embodies the protections that make real the pronouncements in our historic Declaration of Independence and give meaning to our inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
The Constitution requires due process and guarantees equal protection of the law. It protects our freedom of thought and expression, our freedom to worship or not as each of us chooses, and our political freedoms, as well. It is the basis for our fundamental right of privacy and for limiting government's intrusions and burdens in our lives. 
I have opposed what I perceive to be a growing fascination with laying waste to our Constitution and the protections that have served us well for over 200 years. The First Amendment, separation of powers and power of the purse should be supported and defended. That is the oath we all swore when we entered this public service. That is our duty to those who forged this great document, our responsibility to those who sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution, our commitment to our constituents and our legacy to those who will succeed us. 
In this Congress we have seen over 100 constitutional amendments proposed. Yesterday, the Judiciary Committee voted to report an amendment that would cut back on the First Amendment for the first time in our nation's history. Today, the Committee was considering a second proposed amendment to the Constitution in as many days. Proposed amendments to our fundamental charter require consideration whether they are, in the language of Article V of the Constitution, constitutionally `necessary'. I hope that we will not burden the states with a hodgepodge of poll-driven, popular sounding constitutional amendments. 
This Senate only barely rejected the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution last year. I recall all too well when we were told that we could never achieve a balanced budget without a constitutional amendment. I recall the stacks of deficit-laden federal budgets proposed by Republican and Democratic Presidents since President Johnson and being told that the only answer to annual budget deficits was to pass an ill-conceived constitutional amendment whose terms and effects could not be explained. 
I asked then why it is necessary to seek to amend the Constitution? If Congress could get close to a two-thirds majority vote to support a constitutional amendment declaring that we would normally balance the budget, we should be able to achieve a simple majority that will actually vote to reduce the deficit and pass a balanced budget. 
I defended the Constitution during the course of the balanced budget amendment debate last year and this year President Clinton sent us the first balanced budget in almost 30 years. What some said could not happen without a constitutional amendment, did happen. With cooperation in the Congress, we can enact the first balanced budget since 1969, and we will have done it without inserting a fiscal straightjacket on future generations into the text of the United States Constitution. 
They said it could not be done, but it can, as a result of the sound fiscal policies of this Administration which have led not only to balance but to the prospect of budget surplus. In 1993, a Democratic Congress put us on the right road to fiscal responsibility when we took the hard votes and passed the President's plan. This Congress should culminate that extraordinary 5-year effort without further delay. 
April 15 was the legal deadline for Congress to have passed a budget resolution. While the Senate did some preliminary work on a flawed proposal earlier this year, Congress is recessing again this week without completing this fundamental task. The Senate should spend less time seeking to rewrite the work of the Framers and show more courage in completing its legislative responsibilities. 
I hope that as Congress leaves for the Independence Day recess, we will reflect on what makes this country great, and that the majority will return committed to completing work on a balanced budget to serve the American people without additional delay. It should be balanced in two senses: It should be a balanced series of proposals to meet the health, education, environmental and law enforcement needs of the country. And it should also, for the first time in almost three decades, be a budget that will not rely on deficit financing. 
Completing action on the budget is the first step toward Congress taking action on the annual appropriations bills that are so important to the government programs that protect the environment and assist State and local governments with education and law enforcement. Those contracting with the government, those working in partnership with government services and those dependent on government services deserve better. Americans deserve peace of mind and the assurance that their government is working. Congress needs to complete its budget and appropriations legislation so that the agencies and service providers can plan programs, pay workers and serve the American public in an effective manner. 
It is high time for the congressional leadership to do its job and for the Congress to get on about the business of governing. Congress should not be taking breaks without having completed the work of the people. Such callous disregard for the needs of the American people has become too much the rule as year after year under Republican leadership Congress recesses without having completed its work on emergency supplementals, budgets, and appropriations bills. Republican congressional leadership is well-known for shutting down the government by not completing work on these basic measures in a timely way. 
The Senate will also recess again this week without having passed a strong tobacco bill. Tobacco legislation is now added to the litany of important matters the Congress has left unfinished--added to the budget, campaign finance reform, and the prompt consideration of the many fine men and women the President has nominated to long vacant federal judgeships across the country. 
I urge that when Congress reconvenes in July and in the 11 weeks in session left in this congressional year, it take seriously its responsibilities to the American people and show respect and appreciation for the Constitution by working to fulfil our legislative responsibilities.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my amendment, which has been accepted by both sides, would authorize funding for the identification and development of atlernatives to anti-personnel landmines, including those used in mixed mine systems. I want to thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin for their invaluable assistance, patience and support in getting this amendment adopted. 
This is a modest but important amendment. Contrary to what some misinformed people have suggested, it does not ban anti-personnel landmines. There is an international Convention that has been signed by 126 nations, including every one of our NATO allies except Turkey, which bans the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel mines, but that is not this amendment. I mention it, though, because the White House recently committed the United States Government to sign that Convention when alternatives to anti-personnel mines are available, and to search aggressively for alternatives. They set a target date of 2006 for signing the Convention, and last September President Clinton announced that the United States will stop using anti-personnel mines outside Korea by 2003. It is my hope and expectation that by working together and with the resources to do the job, we can join the Convention by 2003. That is also about the same time that signatories to the Convention must have destroyed their stockpiles of anti-personnel mines, and when our NATO allies have said they want our mines removed from their territory. It is a logical deadline. 
As I have said, when the White House announced that the United States will sign the Convention when alternatives are available, they also committed to `search aggressively' for alternative tactics, technologies and/or operational concepts to anti-personnel mines that are compliant with the Convention. This amendment simply authorizes the next year of funds to do that--a total of $17,200,000 for fiscal year 1999, and it calls for two separate studies to be done by independent scientific organizations. Although they are not named in the amendment, it is our intention and expectation that the Pentagon will initiate contracts with the National Academy of Sciences and the Rand Corporation to do the studies. Both are widely respected organizations that have done similar types of studies in the past. The National Academy estimates that such a study would take a year to complete and cost approximately $750,000. It is our hope that these studies will assist in steering the Pentagon in the right direction so rapid progress can be made in finding and deploying alternatives. 
Mr. President, there are respected, retired military officers who believe that suitable alternatives already exist. They have done considerable research on existing weapons systems and are convinced that, since an effective minefield must be kept under constant observation, a combination of sensors and smart munitions that can destroy moving armored vehicles can provide a comparable combat capability to our mixed mine systems. Therefore, it may not be necessary to develop new technologies, because tactics, technologies and/or operational concepts may already exist that can be adapted, modified, or otherwise utilized with comparable effect. That is why the amendment refers explicitly to the `adaptation, modification, and research and 
development,' of both `existing and new tactics, technologies, and operational concepts.' It is important that the search for alternatives explore all possible options. 
It is no secret that I had hoped that the United States would be among the first to sign the Convention when it was opened for signature in Ottawa last December. However, that was not to be, and since then I have sought to find a common approach so the United States could signal to the world our clear intention to join the Convention as soon as practicable. Over a period of months, General Ralston, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisory Sandy Berger and I discussed a number of issues including a way for the United States to join the Convention in a manner that is acceptable to the Pentagon. We now have that commitment, and while it may be some years before the United States signs, there are interim steps we can take to support the Convention. 
We should urge other governments that have not yet signed, including Russia and China, to declare their intention to do so as soon as practicable, as we have. They too should undertake to remove whatever obstacles are in the way. We can also use the framework of the Convention to share technology, disclose mine stockpiles, identify mined areas, and support demining and assistance for mine victims. 
Mr. President, this has been a long time in coming. President Clinton first called on the Pentagon to search for alternatives to anti-personnel mines back in 1994, and then for two years nothing happened. Then in May 1996 and again last September, he directed the Pentagon to do so. A few million dollars have been spent, but there has not been anything resembling a serious program. The prevailing attitude at the Pentagon has been that there are better uses of time and money, so let's do as little as possible and say we tried. 
Obviously, if the Pentagon wants to avoid finding alternatives to landmines they know how to do that. They can try to hold back the money for research, they can say they cannot find alternatives that do absolutely everything landmines do, and they can continue to overstate their need for landmines. This will be a test of their good faith. I would urge them to approach this with the kind of `can-do' attitude they like to be known for, and to look closely at the technologies they already have. As I have said before, if we can drive a rover on Mars from a laptop on Earth, we can do this. I am convinced that it is a matter of will and resources. 
General Ralston and Sandy Berger have pledged to make every effort to get the job done. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General David Jones, accepted President Clinton's offer to monitor the Pentagon's progress in finding alternatives. These are men of their word and I have no doubt that they will do everything possible to see this through. I will support them in every way possible. 
Again, I want to thank the managers of the bill, Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin and their staffs.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to recognize Mrs. Ellie McNamara for a career of exemplary service in Vermont public schools. Her career spans four decades, beginning in 1958 as a fourth grade teacher, and for the last 17 years as principal of the C.P. Smith primary school in Burlington. She will retire at the close of this school year. 
There is no better evidence than the work of Mrs. McNamara to the truth of the adage, `There is no substitute for a good teacher.' 
The devotion with which she met the challenges of teaching and then as a principal won her the hearts and minds of students, faculty and parents alike. She has made a difference. 
Even as she moves into retirement she continues to serve as a role model for all of us. I wish her well as she moves into the next stage of her life. 
Marcelle and I have known Ellie McNamara, her husband Jim who is a distinguished lawyer and her wonderful family for decades. Burlington and Vermont are proud of her and her family.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since S. 10 was voted out of the Judiciary Committee almost one year ago, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at hearings on numerous occasions to urge its Republican sponsors to work with me in a bipartisan and open manner to improve this juvenile crime bill. Instead of dialogue, the sponsors of this legislation have played games of `Hide and Seek' with the revisions they were making to the bill. 
I am delighted to see reflected in the brief `DRAFT' summary circulated by the sponsors of the bill that they are finally and belatedly making certain changes that they voted down during the Committee's consideration of this bill. The `devil is in the details', however, so I and my Democratic colleagues are eager to see the full text of this revised bill. 
Unfortunately, the sponsors of this bill were not willing to work with me last year when we would have had a much better chance of moving this important legislation. Now, as we head toward the end of this Congress and still face a number of vital appropriations matters to consider, time is running out to complete action on a juvenile crime bill. Those who will suffer from the dilatory manner in which this bill was handled are the children of this country and America's law enforcement officers and prosecutors who are eager for the additional resources available in this bill. 
I am delighted to see that the legislation is being revised to include changes proposed by Democrats that the Republican sponsors previously rejected, including: 
Retention of State Presumption to Prosecute Juveniles: The revised S. 10 will apparently preserve the `presumption in favor of state prosecution' for juveniles who face concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over the offense committed. This language is clearly based on amendments I and others proposed to avoid the federalization of juvenile crime that has prompted expressions of concern by Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference States have had primary responsibility for handling juvenile cases, and they should continue to do so. 
Death Penalty: The new S. 10 apparently would not subject juveniles to the federal death penalty, another policy which Democratic members of the Committee insisted upon during Committee debate. As introduced, S. 10 allowed the imposition of the death penalty for juveniles as young as sixteen. 
Increased Flexibility for the Incentive Block Grant program: The strict earmarks in this block grant for building more juvenile facilities, drug testing juveniles and enhancing State recordkeeping systems would have imposed a one-size-fits-all strait jacket on the States. The sponsors of the bill, apparently, have finally recognized how critical it is to provide flexibility to the States because State and local officials are much better able to determine how to reduce juvenile delinquency rates in their own communities. 
Revised Recordkeeping Provisions: For over a year, I have repeatedly told my colleagues that no State in the nation would be eligible for S. 10's Incentive Block Grant, since none currently complies with the strict recordkeeping requirements. Moreover, at my request, the Department of Justice conducted a study which concluded that the extensive recordkeeping requirements in this bill would cost States `hundreds of millions of dollars.' I urged the authors of this bill to narrow the focus of the recordkeeping to those juveniles who are most likely to be repeat offenders, namely, those who commit acts which would be a felony if committed by an adult. The sponsors have apparently finally heeded these common sense concerns and promise to correct these flaws--even though they voted down amendments I proposed to make these corrections. 
Increased Funding for Prosecutors: The sponsors have also finally agreed to double the funds available to prosecutors. It is unfortunate that they refused to work this out in Committee last year so that additional prosecutors could be at work right now. 
Improved Sight and Sound Separation Requirement: Last year, I joined with Senators Biden and Kohl and other Democrats to urge the adoption of the more protective federal standards for juveniles in State detention facilities but the Republican sponsors of S. 10 rejected these changes to the bill. I am delighted to see that this mean-spirited provision may be modified, and that juveniles held in state facilities will have the same protections from adult inmates as juveniles in federal custody. 
Dedicated Prevention Funding: Despite being repeatedly rebuffed when I and my fellow Democrats insisted that prevention programs needed dedicated funding, I am pleased that the sponsors of S. 10 apparently have changed their tune and are promising to dedicate funding to prevention programs. A dedicated fund of $50 million per year is a start. 
Revisions to the Federal Firearms Code: I warned my colleagues over a year ago that certain provisions the `Federal Gang Violence Act,' incorporated in Title II of S. 10, would lead to the largest increase in the federal regulation of firearms in the history of our nation. No one heeded my advice then, but the sponsors of this bill have apparently finally realized they need to modify these provisions. The revised S. 10 has more than halved the number of firearm offenses that can serve as predicates for gang-related offenses or under the RICO statute. 
I remain eager to review the actual text of this revised bill. I also remain hopeful that the sponsors of S. 10 will commit to working openly with me and other Democrats to craft common sense, reasonable approaches to reduce juvenile crime while there is still time in this Congress.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, now that we have passed legislation to implement the WIPO copyright treaties, it is time for the Senate to consider another bill of critical importance to America's businesses: The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507. 
The patent bill has been stalled by Republican holds for over a year. It is time that the Senate turn to it and reform our patent laws. The patent bill was based on a proposal submitted by the Clinton Administration several years ago. It was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 22, 1997, with a favorable vote of 17-1 and has the support of every Democrat on the Committee. Its co-sponsors, in addition to myself, include Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, Harkin and Lieberman. 
The patent bill would reform the U.S. patent system in important ways. It would slash red tape in the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO); ensure that American inventors are not disadvantaged as compared to foreign inventors by requiring patent applications to be published in the U.S. at the same time they are published abroad; reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; and require the PTO to develop statewide computer networks with remote library sites to enhance access to electronic patent information for independent inventors and small businesses in rural states. 
In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small companies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill be one that helps them just as much as it helps the larger companies. I talked to independent inventors and representatives of smaller companies to see what reforms they recommended. I invited the President of the Vermont Inventors Association to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on this bill, and I have tried to make sure that the sound recommendations of small businesses and independent inventors were incorporated in the Hatch-Leahy substitute that the Judiciary Committee reported to the Senate over one year ago. 
The White House Conference on Small Businesses, which consists of over 2,000 delegates elected from hundreds of thousands of active small businesses nationwide; the National Association of Women Business Owners; the Small Business Technology Coalition; National Small Business United; the National Venture Capital Association; and the American Small Business Coalition for Patent Reform have concluded that, if enacted, this bill will be of great benefit to small businesses. 
What is holding up floor consideration of the bill? I think it is time to debate this bill on the merits. The Senate Republican leadership should schedule prompt action on this important measure. 
Our nation's economic prosperity in the coming years will depend on our abilities to invent and protect those inventions through our intellectual property laws. American innovators face global competition, and they need updated laws to continue to lead the world. This modernization of our patent laws is an important component of that essential effort. Along with the legislation the Senate recently approved to implement the WIPO copyright treaties, this bill goes a long way to protecting American ingenuity in the next century. Democrats have been ready to proceed to consider this measure for over a year. With less than 53 legislative days left in this session, I urge the Republican leadership to work with us to schedule action on this important bill.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know that consumers are becoming more and more concerned about the merger mania that has hit the United States--they see the potential for higher prices to consumers and poorer service as industries become far more concentrated in fewer hands. 
I am also concerned about this trend, particularly when mergers take place between incumbent monopolies. Specifically, the mergers among Regional Bell Operating Companies, which continue to have a virtual strangle-hold on the local telephone loop, pose the greatest threat to healthy competition in the telecommunications industry. 
Indeed, incumbent telephone companies still control over 99% of the local residential telephone markets. In other words, new entrants have captured less than 1% of local residential phone service. 
The Telecommunications Act's promise of competition was a sales pitch that has not materialized to benefit American consumers. Instead of competition, we see entrenchment, mega-mergers, consolidation and the divvying up of markets. Even Edward Whitacre, Jr., the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SBC Communications, testified several weeks ago before the Antitrust Subcommittee that `The Act promised competition that has not come.' 
At a recent judiciary committee hearing on mergers, Alan Greenspan acknowledged that the Act has not lived up to its promises of lower consumer costs and more competition. 
Since passage of this law, Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel into SBC Corporation, and Bell Atlantic has merged with NYNEX. Now, SBC Corporation is seeking to purchase Ameritech. What once had been seven separate local monopolies will soon be four, with the possibility of more on the horizon. One of my home state newspapers--the Rutland Daily Herald--commented in an editorial that, `It might even seem as if Ma Bell's corpse is coming back to life.' 
I voted against the Telecommunications Act because I did not believe it was sufficiently procompetitive. I raised a number of concerns as that Act was being considered by the Senate. I said in my floor statement on the day the new law passed:  
Mega-mergers between telecommunications giants, such as the rumored merger between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, or the gigantic network mergers now underway, raise obvious concerns about concentrating control in a few gigantic companies of both the content and means of distributing the information and entertainment American consumers receive. Competition, not concentration, is the surest way to assure lower prices and greater choices for consumers. Rigorous oversight and enforcement by our antitrust agencies is more important than ever to insure that such mega-mergers do not harm consumers. 
I am very concerned that this concentration of ownership in the telecommunications industry is currently proceeding faster than the growth of competition. We are seeing old monopolies getting bigger and expanding their reach. 
Upon completion of all the proposed mergers among the Bell companies, most of the local telephone lines in the country will be concentrated in the hands of three to four companies. This will affect not only the millions of people who depend on the companies involved for both basic telephone service and increasingly for an array of advanced telecommunications services, but also competition in the entire industry. The Consumers Union recently testified before the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee that the mergers between Regional Bell Operating Companies could lead to even more mega-mergers within this industry. 
I know personally that at my farm in Vermont and here at my office in the District of Columbia and at my home in Virginia, I still have only one choice for dial-tone and local telephone service. That `choice' is the Bell operating company or no service at all. The current mantra of the industry seems to be `one-stop shopping.' But if that stop is at a monopoly that is 
not competing on price and service, I do not think it is the kind of `one-stop shopping' consumers want. 
I have been concerned that the distraction of these huge mergers serve only to complicate and delay the companies' compliance with their obligations under the Telecommunications Act to open their networks. That is not good for competition in the local loop. Consolidation is taking precedence over competition. We need to reverse that priority, and make opening up the local loop the focus of the energies of the Bell Operating Companies. Then consolidation, if it happens, would not pose the current risk of creating additional barriers to effective competition. 
Big is not necessarily bad. But the Justice Department in the late 1970's worked overtime to divide up the old Ma Bell to assure more competition and provide customers with better service at lower rates. It is ironic that the Telecommunications Act, which was touted as the way to increase competition, is having the reverse effect instead of promoting consolidation among telephone companies. 
Before all the pieces of Ma Bell are put together again, Congress should revisit the Telecommunications Act. To ensure competition among Bell Operating Companies and long distance and other companies, as contemplated by passage of this law, we need clearer guidelines and better incentives. Specifically, we should ensure that Bell Operating Companies do not gain more concentrated control over huge percentages of the telephone access lines of this country through mergers, but only through robust competition. 
As the Consumers Union recently testified, `If Congress really wants to bring broad-based competition to telecommunications markets, it must rewrite the Telecommunications Act, giving antitrust and regulatory authorities more tools to eliminate the most persistent pockets of telephone and cable monopoly power.' 
Today I am introducing antitrust legislation that will bar future mergers between Bell Operating Companies or GTE, unless the federal requirements for opening the local loop to competition have been satisfied in at least half of the access lines in each State. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation to make the Telecommunications Act live up to some of its promise. 
The bill provides that a `large local telephone company' may not merge with another large local telephone company unless the Attorney General finds that the merger will promote competition for telephone exchange services and exchange access services. Also, before a merger can take place the Federal Communications Commission must find that each large local telephone company has for at least one-half of the access lines in each State served by such carrier, of which as least one-half are residential access lines, fully implemented the requirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934. 
The bill requires that each large local telephone company that wishes to merge with another must file an application with the Attorney General and the FCC. A review of these applications will be subject to the same time limits set under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. 
The bill also provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws of the United States, or any authority of the Federal Communications Commission, or any authority of the States with respect to mergers and acquisitions of large local telephone companies. 
The bill is effective on enactment and has no retroactive effect. It is enforceable by the Attorney General in federal district courts.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing this important legislation, the `Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act,' S. 1379. Last year, Congress passed a resolution calling upon federal agencies to make public any records in their possession about individuals who are alleged to have committed Nazi war crimes. I agree with the original sponsors of this bill, Senators Moynihan, DeWine, Kohl, D'Amato, Dodd and Hatch, who said in a Dear Colleague letter in October, 1997, that this bill `would put last year's words into action.' 
The substitute amendment we consider today requires creation of an interagency working group to collect and release classified Nazi war crime records within one year, and gives Nazi war crime victims expedited access to these records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These victims are growing older and we should ensure that if they are interested in seeing these records, their requests should be honored as speedily as possible. 
I first became aware of this bill when I testified in June 1996 at a hearing before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee (GRO). That hearing focused on my Electronic FOIA amendments, which were enacted later that year, and the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, H.R. 1281, which had been introduced by that Committee's Ranking Member, Representative Carolyn Maloney. 
Moving oral testimony and written statements were presented at that hearing about the need for full disclosure by federal agencies about what our government knew, and when, about Nazi atrocities and the criminals who committed those atrocities. Rabbi Marvin Hier (the Dean and Founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center), the Jewish Community Relations Council, the Anti-Defamation League, the Orthodox Union, the American Jewish Committee, and others, committed to teaching the lessons of the Holocaust expressed their strong support for full disclosure of Nazi war crime records. War Crimes Disclosure Act, Health Information Privacy Protection Act, and S. 1090, Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act of 1995: Hearing on H.R. 1281 and S. 1090 before the Subcomm. on Government Management, Information, and Technology of the House Comm. on Government Reform and Oversight, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-30 (1996). 
To the extent that records pertaining to Nazi war criminals remain classified over fifty years since the end of the war, we should take action to disclose those records. No Nazi war criminal should be protected by government secrecy rules. This is what happened with government records pertaining to Kurt Waldheim: the Central Intelligence Agency withheld critical information from researchers about Waldheim's collaboration with the Nazis, even as other government agencies were placing him on the list of individuals forbidden to enter our country because of suspected war crimes. Moreover, an extensive Justice Department report on Waldheim completed in 1987 was then kept secret for six long years, before Attorney General 
Reno, in response to a FOIA lawsuit, released the document in 1994. The United States government should not help Nazi war criminals keep their past crimes secret. This bill is an important step to ensure our government does not. 
Senator DeWine and I worked closely on a substitute amendment to this bill that was offered in the Judiciary Committee and favorably reported on March 5, 1998, with the unanimous backing of Committee Members. Further refinements to the bill are reflected in the Manager's amendment considered by the Senate today to address the legitimate concerns raised by the Department of Justice, our intelligence agencies, press associations and others who use the FOIA regularly, as well as those who have a personal stake and interest in full disclosure of Nazi War crime records. 
The bill calls for the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group to be created by the President shortly after enactment and authorizes this Group to operate for three years. The Working Group will include as members the Director of the Holocaust Museum, the Historian of the Department of State, the Archivist of the United States, and heads of agencies selected by the President. In addition, the President may select from the private sector up to three other persons whom he considers appropriate to assist in completely and effectively carrying out the functions of the Interagency Group. 
The Interagency Group is tasked under the bill with locating, identifying, inventorying, recommending for declassification and making available to the public at the National Archives and Records Administration all classified Nazi War criminal records in the possession of federal agencies, and submit to Congress, including to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on GRO, a report describing its activities. While the bill requires that these tasks be completed within one year, the Interagency Group is authorized for a full three years in the event that certain of these tasks require additional time. The bill also authorizes the appropriation of any necessary funds. 
The original Senate bill defined the records of suspected Nazis subject to disclosure so broadly that it could conceivably have covered many irrelevant records, such as social security records, medical records or tax records, even though such records may have had nothing to do with the person's possible activities as a Nazi. This raised certain privacy issues as well as concerns about the burden on federal agencies to collect, review and disclose records, which had no bearing on the person's activities as a Nazi or our government's knowledge of that person's war crimes. 
The Manager's amendment addresses these concerns by limiting the records subject to disclosure to classified Nazi war criminal records and retaining an exemption for those records, or parts thereof, that would `constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' 
The bill now defines `Nazi war criminal records' as those classified records or portions of records pertaining to persons who, from March 23, 1933 through May 8, 1945, under the direction or in association with the Nazis ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of their race, religion, national origin or political opinion, as well as to any transaction involving the assets of those persecuted persons when the 
transaction involved assets taken without their consent or the consent of their heirs. Determination of the classified records that fall within the scope of the bill is given to the `sole discretion' of the agencies in possession of the records. 
The original bill would have amended the FOIA with a new section of Nazi war crime records containing ten newly-created exemptions separate from those under the current FOIA. I have spent many years fighting for more openness in government. I was very concerned that creating these new exemptions might set a dangerous precedent--though entirely unintentional on the part of the original sponsors--of expanding FOIA exemptions. At a minimum, these new exemptions would have created confusion about how the current FOIA exemptions were to be interpreted and applied. These concerns about the new exemptions have been resolved by taking the work of the Interagency Group out of the FOIA and making its activities the subject of a free standing law. 
The Interagency Group is required to release the classified Nazi war criminal records covered by the bill in their entirety, subject to ten enumerated exemptions. The first exemption in section 3(b)(2)(A) of the bill is for records or parts thereof that `constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' This is the same standard used in the sixth exemption of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)). In the FOIA context, the phrase enunciates a policy of a balancing of interests between the protection of an individual's private affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny, and the preservation of the public's right to government records. Committee reports underlying the original FOIA of 1966 indicate that the exemption is to protect `intimate' or `personal' details in files such as those maintained by the Veterans Administration (now the Department of Veterans Affairs), the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education), and the Selective Service System. As with the other FOIA exemptions, the personal privacy exception in the FOIA is permissively applied, and it has come to be understood that the balancing of interests tilts in favor of disclosure. 
Transferring the FOIA experience to the use of the same phrase in exemption (A) of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, it is the intent that the same balancing of interests--between the protection of an individual's private affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny and the preservation of the public's right to government records--occur when the disclosure of Nazi war criminal records is under consideration. The exemption may be used to protect intimate or personal details, such as an individual's medical history, marital status, legitimacy of children, family fights or domestic affairs, and sexual inclination or associations. While the right to privacy of deceased persons is not entirely settled, we expect the Department of Justice and other agencies to follow the majority rule that death extinguishes a person's privacy rights. Indeed, I note that `[t]he Department of Justice has long followed this rule as a matter of policy.' U.S. Dep't of Justice, Freedom of Information Act Guide & Privacy Act Overview, September 1997. 
Thus, the personal privacy exemption in the bill is to be permissively applied, and the balancing of interests tilts in favor of disclosure. 
Likewise, the balancing of the other Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act exemptions tilts in favor of disclosure. Section 3(b)(3)(A) of the bill states that, in applying exemptions (B) through

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have the pleasure of joining Senator Jeffords to rise in support of the renewable energy programs within the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. First, I would like to thank Senator Domenici for accepting the Jeffords/Roth amendment to increase funding for these vital programs. With the dramatic changes taking place in the energy sector, our nation is faced with many opportunities to increase our consumption of renewable energy sources. There are two trends in the energy sector converging to make this change possible--utility restructuring and decreasing costs for renewable energy. 
In my home State of Vermont, renewable technology companies are building wind turbines that are used in Europe, the Far East and South America. Unfortunately, the United States is behind much of the world in adopting wind and other renewable energy technology. Much more work needs to be done to spur the utilization of renewable energy. Although the cost of renewable energy has decreased significantly over the last decade, it still must compete against the artificially low cost of fossil energy. As we see the level of mercury and other heavy metals increase in our lakes while the views of our mountains are obscured by air pollutants--the need to find alternative sources of energy becomes all the more vivid. 
Recent articles have highlighted the public's interest in maintaining renewable power as an option for meeting their energy needs. The last two decades have witnessed a decline in the cost of renewable energy. Research by the Energy Department and the commitment of private energy companies has produced this decline. As a nation, we must build upon this partnership and encourage the private sector to continue to develop cost-reducing technology. Unfortunately, the recent trend in federal research funding has not supported this partnership. 
Wind Energy Research and development program has been extraordinarily successful in bringing down the cost of wind-generated electricity. To allow expansion of this large resource base, and to allow wind energy to be competitive in an era of utility restructuring that emphasizes low initial cost and independent power projects, significant improvements to the technology are still needed to reach the Program's goal of 2.5 cents per kilowatt by 2000. In addition, research and analysis relating to restructuring in the electric utility industry should be conducted on issues associated with integration of wind and other renewable energy systems into an increasingly competitive industry framework. 
Vermont is also leading the country in the deployment of biomass technology--both large and small. We are proud that the Department of Energy selected the McNeil Plant in Burlington to conduct a full scale demonstration of biomass gasification. In February, the project made history when the plant produced gas for fuel from wood chips. The effort at McNeil to demonstrate how our country can produce energy from renewable crops makes sense to Vermonters who have already embraced biomass as a renewable source of energy. Twenty State office buildings and eighteen schools use biomass for heat during the winter. 
By increasing funding for renewable energy by $65 million, the Jeffords/Roth amendment will help us make this leap. Mr. President, this amendment makes sense for our future and our children's future. Our children should be able to enjoy sustainable, clean and renewable energy. 
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just a couple of weeks ago, I commented in the Congressional Record on the Senate majority's poor record in acting on judicial nominees, especially noting those judicial nominees who are either minorities or women. I included a recent letter from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which calls upon the Senate Republican leadership to allow votes on the Latino judicial nominees who have languished in the Senate for far too long. 
I have also spoken often about the crisis in the second circuit and the need for the Senate to move forward to confirm the nominees to that court who are pending on the calendar. 
Judge Sonia Sotomayor is just such a qualified nominee, and she is one being held up by the Republican majority, apparently because some on the other side of the aisle believe she might one day be considered by President Clinton for nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, should a vacancy arise. 
Last week, a lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal discussed this secret basis for the Republican hold against this fine judge. The Journal reveals that these delays are intended to ensure that Sonia Sotomayor not be nominated to the Supreme Court, although it is hard to figure out just how that is logical or sensible. 
In fact, how disturbing, how petty, and how shameful: Trying to disqualify an outstanding Hispanic woman judge by an anonymous hold. 
I have far more respect for Senators who, for whatever reason, wish to vote against her. Stand up; vote against her. But to have an anonymous hold--an anonymous hold--in the U.S. Senate with 100 Members representing 260 million Americans, which should be the conscience of the Nation, should not be lurking in our cloakrooms anonymously trying to hold up a nominee. If we want to vote against somebody, vote against them. I respect that. State your reasons. I respect that. But don't hold up a qualified judicial nominee. 
I was asked last week by Neil Lewis of the New York Times about this circumstance. He correctly reported my response in a front page story this last Saturday. I am offended by this anonymous effort to oppose her prompt confirmation by stealth tactics. Here is a highly qualified Hispanic woman judge who should have been confirmed to help end the crisis in the Second Circuit more than three months ago. 
The times Argus recently included an editorial entitled `Partisan Nonsense' on this hold. The editorial notes that Judge Sotomayor rose from a housing project in the Bronx to Princeton, Yale and a federal court appointment by President Bush, a Republican. The editorial notes that the stalling tactics are aggravating the judicial emergency faced by the Second Circuit caused by judicial vacancies for which the Republican leadership in the Senate refuses to consider her, and another worthy nominee. The editorial concludes by urging me to make `a lot of noise over this partisan nonsense.' 
I don't always follow the editorials in my home State. But this one I am happy to follow. 
I will continue to speak out on behalf of Judge Sotomayor and all the qualified nominees being stalled here in the U.S. Senate. 
Judge Sotomayor in not the only woman or minority judicial nominee who has been needlessly stalled. Indeed, if one considers those nominees who have taken the longest to confirm this year, we find a disturbing pattern: 
Hilda Tagle, the only Hispanic woman the Senate has confirmed this year, took 32 months to be confirmed as a district court judge for the Southern District of Texas. That is more than two-and-one-half years. 
Judge Richard Paez, currently a district court judge and a nominee to the Ninth Circuit, was first nominated in January 1996. Twenty-nine months latter, Judge Paez's nomination remains in limbo on the Senate calendar. 
Nor have we seen any progress on the nomination of Jorge Rangel to the Fifth Circuit or Anabelle Rodriquez to the District Court for Puerto Rico, although her nomination was received in January 1996, almost 29 months ago. 
For that matter, we have seen the President's nomination of Judge James A. Beaty Jr., the first African American nominated to the Fourth Circuit, stalled for 30 months, since December 1995. The situation in the Fourth Circuit was the topic of a Washington Post editorial past Saturday. We have seen the attack on Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson, who would have been the first African-American woman to serve on the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, but who was forced to withdraw. We have seen the nomination of Clarence Sundram held up since September 1995, almost 33 months. 
In his annual report on the judiciary this year on New Year's Day, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.' He went on to note: `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.' Which of course is absolutely correct. 
For some unexplained reason, judicial nominees who are women or racial or ethnic minorities seem to take the longest in the Senate. Of the 10 judicial nominees whose nominations have been pending the longest before the Senate, eight are women and racial or ethnic minority candidates. A ninth has been delayed in large measure because of opposition to his mother, who already serves as a judge. The tenth is one who blew the lid off the $1.4 million right-wing campaign to `kill' Clinton judicial nominees. 
Pending on the Senate calendar, having been passed over again and again, are Judge Sonia Sotomayor, Judge Richard Paez, Oki Mollway and Ronnie White. Held up in committee after two hearings is Clarence Sundram. Still without a hearing are Anabelle Rodriquez, Judge James A. Beaty Jr., and Jorge C. Rangel. What all these nominees have in common is that they are either women or members of racial or ethnic minorities. 
Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its member--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees in the 104th and 105th Congresses, the Senate is shirking its duty. The Senate majority's choices as they stall Hispanic, women and minority nominees is wrong and should end. 
Mr. President, I have served here for nearly 24 years. I know Members of the Senate. I have enormous respect for so many of them, Republicans and Democrats alike. The vast majority of Senators I have served with do not have any bias or ethnic bias against people. They do not have a religious bias. They do not have a gender bias. But somehow ethnic and gender biases have crept into the stalling of these nominations. 
If Senators are opposed to any judge, bring them up and vote against them. But don't do an anonymous hold, which diminishes the credibility and respect of the whole U.S. Senate. 
I have had judicial nominations by both Democrat and Republican Presidents that I intended to oppose. But I fought like mad to make sure they at least got a chance to be on the floor for a vote. 
I have stated over and over again on this floor that I would refuse to put an anonymous hold on any judge; that I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether it is somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt the Senate should do its duty. 
If we don't like somebody the President nominates, vote him or her down. But don't hold them in this anonymous unconscionable limbo, because in doing that, the minority of Senators really shame all Senators.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. Last year, the Senator and I discussed the energy generation problems facing rural areas of the United States. The Chairman wisely included funding in the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Appropriations bill to address this problem. In rural areas, energy distribution systems are often more difficult and expensive to establish. As a result, communities are often forced to rely on more polluting fuel sources because they have lower up front capital costs. The Jeffords amendment the Chairman accepted this morning increases funding for the Remote Power Initiative to $5 million. Is that correct?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. Senator Domenici, I would like to thank you and Senator Reid for your willingness to boost funding for the Department of Energy's important solar and renewable programs. I am especially pleased to see an increase in funding for the biomass energy systems account. In Vermont, work is continuing at the McNeil Generation Plant in Burlington to demonstrate the effectiveness of biomass gasification. This is an important renewable technology which will help our country reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Earlier this year the Department of Energy agreed to a modification of the contract for the McNeil project which resulted in a $6 million increase in the Department's contribution to the South Burlington facility. These funds will be matched dollar for dollar by the partners who are participating with DoE in this important renewable program. Because the contract modification was not reached until after the President had submitted his Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposal, that increase was not reflected in the funding request for the biomass energy systems account. It is my understanding that the increase in funding for biomass energy systems includes the $6 million needed for the Department to meet its obligations under the contract for the McNeil facility.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 
I am pleased to introduce legislation that will implement the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Protocol). This bill is part of my ongoing effort to refine American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests and does not serve to encumber small companies seeking to expand into international markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty, thereby helping American businesses to create a `one stop' international trademark registration process. This bill is one of many measures I have introduced and supported over the past few years to ensure that American trademark holders receive strong protection in today's world of changing technology and complex international markets. 
In addition to this legislation, I have introduced the Trademark Law Treaty Implementing and Registration Simplification Act, which will bring U.S. trademark law into conformance with the Trademark Law Treaty. The Trademark Law Treaty will simplify trademark registration requirements around the world by establishing a list of maximum requirements which Treaty member countries can impose on trademark applicants. All American businesses, and particularly small American businesses, will benefit as a result. 
Earlier this year, I introduced legislation authorizing the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level Domains on trademark and other intellectual property rights. 
Moreover, I supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, which was passed last Congress, to provide intellectual property rights holders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality. 
Together, these measures represent major steps in our efforts to refine American trademark law to ensure that it serves to promote American interests. 
Currently, in order for American companies to protect their trademarks abroad, they must register their trademarks in each and every country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple countries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a process which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American companies seeking international trademark protection. This legislation will ease the registration burden by enabling American businesses to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries with a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. 
Since 1891, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Agreement) has provided an international trademark registration system. However, prior to adoption of the Protocol, the U.S. declined to join the Agreement because it contained terms deemed inimical to American intellectual property interests. In 1989, the terms of the Agreement were modified by the Protocol, which corrected the objectionable terms of the Agreement and made American participation a possibility. For example, under the Protocol, applications for international trademark extension can be completed in English; formerly, applications were required to be completed in French. It should be noted that the Protocol will not require substantive changes to American trademark law, hence the implementing legislation I introduce today is identical to the legislation that passed the House on May 5, 1998 and only would make those technical changes to American law necessary to bring the U.S. into conformity with the Protocol. 
To date, the Administration has resisted accession to the treaty because of voting rights disputes with the European Union, which has sought to retain an additional vote for itself as an intergovernmental entity, in addition to the votes of its member states. I support the Administration's efforts to negotiate a treaty based upon the equitable and democratic principle of one-state, one-vote. However, in anticipation of the eventual resolution of this dispute, the Senate has the opportunity to act now to make the technical changes to American trademark law so that once this voting dispute is satisfactorily resolved and the U.S. accedes to the Protocol, `one-stop' international trademark registration can become an immediate reality for all American trademark applicants.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation and Registration Simplification Act (TLT Act). The TLT Act, which will implement the Trademark Law Treaty of 1994, is an important step in our continuing endeavor to harmonize trademark law around the world so that American businesses--particularly small American businesses--seeking to expand internationally will face simplified and straightforward trademark registration procedures in foreign countries. 
This bill is one of a series I have supported which protect American trademark holders in a world of rapidly changing technology and international competition. Earlier this year I introduced S. 1727, legislation authorizing the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level Domains on trademark and other intellectual property rights owners. Moreover, I supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, which was enacted into law last Congress. This legislation provides intellectual property rights holders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality. Together, these measures represent efforts to refine American trademark law to ensure that it promotes American interests. 
Today more than ever before, trademarks are among the most valuable assets of business. One of the major obstacles in securing international trademark protection is the difficulty and cost involved in obtaining and maintaining a registration in each and every country. Countries around the world have a number of varying requirements for filing trademark applications, many of which are non-substantive and very confusing. Because of these difficulties, many U.S. businesses, especially smaller businesses, are forced to concentrate their efforts on registering their trademarks only in certain major countries while pirates freely register their marks in other countries. 
The Trademark Law Treaty will eliminate many of the arduous registration requirements of foreign countries by enacting a list of maximum requirements for trademark procedures. Eliminating needless formalities will be an enormous step in the direction of a rational trademark system which will benefit American business, especially smaller businesses, to expand into the international market more freely. Fortunately, the Trademark Law Treaty has already been signed by thirty-five countries, has already been ratified by ten countries including Japan and the United Kingdom, and has already been reported favorably to the full Senate by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. 
As the United States is already in accordance with most of the Trademark Law Treaty requirements, the TLT Act would impose only minor changes to U.S. trademark law. The Patent and Trademark Office, the International Trademark Association and the American Intellectual Property Law Association have indicated their support for the TLT Act. 
I hope the Senate will consider and pass this bill expeditiously.

Mr. LEAHY. While current law does not mandate any key recovery, the current Administration, just as past Administrations, uses the export control regime to `dumb down' the encryption available for widespread integration into high-tech products intended for both domestic use and for export to foreign customers. Export regulations in place now are being used expressly to coerce the development and use of encryption products capable of giving law enforcement surreptitious access to plaintext by conditioning the export of 56-bit DES encryption on development of key recovery features. 
These regulations are scheduled to sunset in December 1998, at which time export of even 56-bit strength encryption will no longer be permitted. I understand that the Administration is already undertaking discussions with industry on what will happen upon sunset of these regulations. I have long contended that taking unilateral steps will not resolve this issue, but instead could delay building the consensus we so urgently need. This issue simply cannot by resolved by Executive fiat.

Mr. LEAHY. The Majority Leader is correct that reform of our encryption policy is needed. The Attorney General came to the Hill in March and asked for a legislative moratorium on encryption matters. This request was made because the Administration wanted to talk with the information technology industry about developing means for law enforcement to gain surreptitious access to plaintext scrambled by strong encryption. According to eleven of the world's leading cryptographers in a report reissued on June 8, the technical risks and costs of such backdoors `will exacerbate, not alleviate, the potential for crime and information terrorism' for America's computer users and our critical infrastructures. 
In the Senate we have a name for debate that delays action on legislative matters. We call it a filibuster. On encryption policy, the Administration has been willing to talk, but not to forge a real solution. That amounts to a filibuster. The longer we go without a sensible policy, the more jobs will be lost, the more we risk eroding our privacy rights on the Internet, and the more we leave our critical infrastructures vulnerable.

Mr. LEAHY. Since the hearing I chaired in May 1994 on the Administration's `Clipper Chip' proposal, the Administration has taken some steps in the right direction. Clipper Chip is now dead, and the Administration has transferred authority over the export of encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce Department, as called for in legislation I introduced in the last Congress with Senators Burns, Wyden and others. Furthermore, the Administration has permitted the export of up to 56-bit DES encryption, at least until the end of this year. But these actions are simply not enough for our high-tech industries to maintain their leading edge in the global marketplace.

The E-PRIVACY bill that I have sponsored with Senator Ashcroft, Senator Burns and others, satisfies these goals. Prompt Senate consideration of encryption legislation is sorely needed to protect America's economy and security.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleagues, Senators Cleland and Kerry, in introducing legislation that will bring the resources of SBA's Women's Business Center program much closer to those seeking this help as they work to start their own businesses. This bill does more than recognize the contributions that women make as business owners. This bill tangibly supports and encourages more women to become entrepreneurs. 
The Office of Women's Business Ownership recently released a report to Congress on the success of Women's Business Centers. This report officially confirms what we already informally know: Women are interested in owning their own businesses, and women appreciate the targeted help the Centers offer that relates directly to the unique opportunities and challenges that women face in creating a business. While existing Small Business Administration offices and Small Business Development Centers help women entrepreneurs, this report found that more than three-fourths of the women who have turned to a Women's Business Center appreciate its special focus. SBA offices and SBDCs do not have the resources available to offer the same kind of help. 
Our legislation will supply resources needed to establish a Women's Business Center in each of the fifty states, including in my home state of Vermont. Passage of this bill would give women in Vermont and in other states direct access to information on financing, marketing and managing their own business ventures. Under the provisions of this bill, Vermonters would have access to the wide range of resources that already are available to citizens in 36 other states. 
The bill will also extend additional resources for the online Women's Business Center. This resource, located at www.onlinewbc.org, provides assistance to women who are unable to travel long distances to Centers. With this online resource, women have access to much of the same information that is available at the Centers, and they can ask questions of specialists, all with the click of a mouse. Our bill would enable the Center to expand its online services to women in business. 
Even without the resources of a Women's Business Center, Vermont is a leader in women-owned businesses. The number of women entrepreneurs in Vermont has almost doubled over the last ten years. Women now own more than thirty-eight percent of all businesses in Vermont, which is above the national average of thirty-six percent. Women also employ thirty percent of Vermont's workers, which also exceeds the national average. 
Women have faced unique obstacles and challenges in starting and growing businesses. Some obstacles have been lowered in recent years, and we can all hope that this progress will continue. One step we can take to promote continued progress is by bringing the resources of Women's Business Centers to more women entrepreneurs. We must encourage more Vermont women to tap into this incredible growth. An SBA Women's Business Center in Vermont will do just that by providing women with the framework and support necessary to thrive and excel as business owners.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize two very special Vermont business people. Tom and Sally Fegley are the owners and founders of Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates of Brattleboro, Vermont. For the past two years I have been pleased to nominate Tom and Sally for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business Person of the Year award for the state of Vermont. This year, I am proud to announce that Tom and Sally Fegley are the recipients of this prestigious award. 
Eight and a half years ago, the Fegleys had the courage to move to Vermont and risk their lives' savings to undertake their start-up business in chocolates, a field in which neither of them had any previous experience. With hard work and intense dedication they have built this business to more than $1 million in gross sales in 1997. Their products are sold in all fifty states and they are exported all over the world, including Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, South Africa and the Netherlands. Tom and Sally's entrepreneurial savvy has helped to spread the distinctive high quality of Vermont specialty foods across the globe. 
The Fegley's chocolates are so unique they have received five federal trademarks for their chocolates ranging from `Vermont Pasture Patties' to `Cowlicks.' In addition, their products have won eight national awards and have received media coverage ranging from `Good Morning, America' and `The Today Show' to such magazines as Bon Appetit, Fine Cooking, and Mademoiselle, as well as newspapers including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. 
I remember the first time that Marcelle and I visited Tom and Sally's shop in 1992. We were especially impressed with its old-fashioned atmosphere and Vermont country charm. A few years ago, Tom and Sally decided to combine the sale of their handmade chocolates and candies with the sale of Vermont folkart. This gallery displays the handicrafts of Vermonters as the Fegleys display the fruits of their own handicraft. This innovative combination makes visiting Tom and Sally's a unique and charming experience while promoting Vermont's distinct character. 
Not only have Tom and Sally made an imprint on Vermont's specialty food industry, but they have made an even larger contribution to their community. Perhaps the Fegleys should be recognized more for what they do for others than for their business success. From donating chocolates to local charities, to helping a local apple orchard after vandals destroyed the apple trees, Tom and Sally's involvement and contributions have expanded beyond the business industry and have made them important members of Vermont's communities. 
I am pleased that the Fegleys have been named 1998 Vermont Small Business Persons of the Year. I believe that they embody what Vermont is all about--a fine tradition of quality products with a strong sense of community.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, fifteen years ago the first Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation Race For The Cure was held in Dallas. This year, at least 500,000 participants in more than 85 communities nationwide will host 5-K runs and 1-mile fitness run/walks to raise money for national breast cancer research efforts and local breast cancer initiatives. 
I am proud to be honorary co-chair for this year's Vermont Race For The Cure, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Jeffords. The race will be held in Manchester on July 26. Last year our race was a wonderful community event, with more than 2,300 Vermonters running or walking in the race and with others joining in support through pledges and by cheering racers on. That effort led to $84,000 in grants for nine projects throughout Vermont to support breast cancer treatment, education and survivor support. 
The Race For The Cure is an important and successful effort to raise private funds for breast cancer screening, education, and treatment to reduce and one day eliminate this terrible disease. One woman somewhere in the United States is diagnosed with breast cancer every three minutes and one of its victims dies from the disease every twelve minutes. One in eight women will suffer from breast cancer in her lifetime, and it is the leading cause of death for women between the ages of 35 to 54. 
The private contributions raised by the Race For The Cure are a vital complement to the efforts of those of us in Congress who strive each year to secure federal funding to fight breast cancer. 
We in Congress have made it clear that we plan to continue to increase research funding at the National Institutes of Health. 
And just yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to guarantee at least $135 million for Fiscal Year 1999 for the Department of Defense breast cancer research program. This program continues to spawn far-reaching innovations in medical research, and the seven-year total allocated under this program will rise to $872 million, if this provision is enacted this year. 
Seven years ago, working with the breast cancer survivor community, several of us launched this crusade to earmark a portion of the defense budget for this breast cancer research program, and over the years it has become a crucial supplement to other federally and privately sponsored research efforts. 
Working together on these initiatives, and by supporting such private efforts as the annual Race For The Cure, we are drawing closer, year by year, to the day when we can eliminate the destruction and the pain of breast cancer from the lives of our wives, mothers and sisters.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, several months ago, as the conflict in Indonesia escalated, United States Special Forces training of Indonesian troops came under intense scrutiny. As journalists and human rights groups compiled and publicized allegations of torture, disappearances and killings by `Kopassus,' an Indonesian special forces commando group, and other Indonesian military units, the Defense Department was conducting joint exercises with some of these same forces. It was only several weeks ago that Defense Secretary Cohen suspended the program because of instability in the country. 
The training of U.S. Special Forces on foreign soil provides a valuable opportunity for our soldiers to learn how other militaries operate and to familiarize themselves with different cultures, climates and terrain. They need to be able to operate in the most difficult conditions. However, while the program benefits our soldiers, it also provides training to foreign security forces. And sometimes those forces have a history of involvement in human rights violations. Unlike the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program which screens foreign participants for any involvement in human rights violations, the Special Forces program, which conducted training exercises in 102 countries in fiscal year 1997, apparently does not. No credible effort is made to screen prospective foreign participants. If there were, there is no way this training would be conducted with Kopassus, which has been implicated in a pattern of torture and extrajudicial killings dating back many years.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Judge Rosemary Pooler on her confirmation as a member of the Second Circuit. She has been providing a great service as a United States District Court Judge in the Northern District of New York. President Clinton nominated her last November to fill a vacancy on the Second Circuit. I worked very hard to have her included in a prompt confirmation hearing, was finally able to get her included in a hearing on May 14 and, with the cooperation of Chairman Hatch, have her reported by the Judiciary Committee on May 21. With her confirmation, Judge Pooler becomes the second woman to serve as a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
Ironically, her confirmation also brings into sharp relief the harm that is being perpetuated in the Northern District of New York by the Senate's refusal to consider Clarence Sundrum, another nominee for a longstanding vacancy on an overburdened court. Mr. Sundrum was first nominated in September 1995, over two and one-half years ago. The vacancy has long been considered a judicial emergency. This judicial nomination is the oldest pending judicial nomination before the Senate. After two hearings and almost three years, Mr. Sundrum has still not been considered by the Judiciary Committee or the Senate. 
I was very disappointed that Judge Pooler was not confirmed before the Senate left for its Memorial Day recess. Along with the confirmations of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, Robert Sack and Chester Straub, her confirmation will help end the continuing emergency caused by the vacancy crisis on the Second Circuit. I want to thank the Majority Leader for calling up the nomination of Judge Rosemary Pooler today and Chester Straub yesterday. 
As I noted most recently on May 21 and May 22, the Second Circuit is suffering from an unprecedented emergency caused by the vacancies crisis on that court. We have had four nominees before the Senate for many months who together could help end this crisis. 
On March 25, the five continuing vacancies on the 13-member court caused Chief Judge Ralph Winter to certify a circuit emergency, to begin canceling hearings and to take the unprecedented step of having 3-judge panels convened that include only one Second Circuit judge. On April 23, Chief Judge Winter was forced to issue additional emergency orders. 
The people of the Second Circuit need additional federal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the current vacancies, the Second Circuit be allocated an additional two judgeships to handle its workload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from the vacancy crisis and Senate inaction. 
This past weekend the Second Circuit held its annual circuit conference. I was pleased that this year's meetings could be held in Manchester, Vermont, and congratulate Chief Judge Murtha of the District Court of Vermont on the success of those meetings. 
In connection with the annual conference, the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit issued his annual report. Chief Judge Winter concentrates on `the problem, now chronic as well as aggravated, of obtaining resources equal to the jurisdictional responsibilities entrusted to the Court.' In particular, he notes that the filings with the Court of Appeals rose 20 percent over the last two years while its active judges went down by 33 percent, from 12 to eight. 
After thanking the senior judges, district judges and visiting judges from other circuits, without whom the Second Circuit `would have been engulfed by a backlog that would not be amenable to future reduction,' he went on to note: 
The semblance of normalcy, however, is still just a semblance. Ten panel days in April and June had to be canceled outright. Seven panels were able to hear cases only after I certified that a judicial emergency existed so that the panel could proceed with only one member of the court and two visiting judges. The number of pending cases is increasing at an alarming rate, and the Court has the largest backlog in its history. 
The Chief Judge had some blunt talk for congressional critics. 
He concludes: 
The political branches have steadily increased our federal question jurisdiction, have maintained an unnecessarily broad definition of diversity jurisdiction, and then have denied us resources minimally proportionate to that jurisdiction. That is the problem. The result is that a court with proud traditions of craft in decision-making and currency in its docket is now in danger of losing both. 
I conclude by noting my regret that the Senate is not proceeding to consider the longstanding nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. I will continue to press for her confirmation and that of Robert Sack to the Second Circuit. I have been urging favorable Senate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit for many months. 
Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton University and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the New York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is strongly support by Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato. She is a source of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women. When confirmed she will be only the second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit. 
By a vote of 16 to 2, the Judiciary Committee reported the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Senate. That was on March 5, 1998, almost three months ago. No action has been taken or scheduled on that nomination and no explanation for the delay has been forthcoming. This is the oldest judicial nomination pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. In spite of a bipartisan April 9 letter to the Senate Republican Leader signed by all six Senators from the three States forming the Second Circuit urging prompt action, this nomination continues to be stalled by anonymous objections. Our bipartisan letter to the Majority Leader asked that he call up for prompt consideration by the Senate the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. That was almost three months ago. 
I do not know why this distinguished jurist, who was nominated by President Bush to the District Court and by President Clinton to the Court of Appeals, is being denied consideration by the Senate. I have heard from the Hispanic Caucus and a number of bar associations in support of her confirmation and have to tell them that I cannot dispel the impression that they have that she is being delayed because she is Hispanic. 
Last Friday, Paul Gigot speculated in a column in the May 29 Wall Street Journal that Judge Sotomayor might be a top candidate for the United States Supreme Court should a vacancy arise there. Although his column mischaracterizes her and her judicial record, it confirms the impression of so many that she is being penalized for being an accomplished Hispanic woman.

Mr. LEAHY. I have spoken often, too often, about the crisis in the Second Circuit and our need for the Senate to move forward to confirm the nominees pending on the Senate calendar to that important court. 
Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton University and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the New York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week we conclude another work period by disappointing the American people. We recess, again, without concluding the people's business and passing a strong tobacco bill. Tobacco legislation is now added to the litany of important matters the Congress has left unfinished. 
Last month, the Congress adjourned without even completing the federal budget and this month we recess, again, without concluding even that basic action. 
Most Americans think of April 15 as the day that they file their tax returns and pay their taxes, and most Americans dutifully collect their financial records and go through the sometimes arduous task of preparing their tax returns. I hope that next year and in the years ahead that task will be made a little easier by legislation I have sponsored to require the IRS to post information and forms on the Internet, along with regulations and rulings. 
Well, April 15 was also the legal deadline for Congress to have passed a budget resolution. While the Senate did some preliminary work on a flawed proposal earlier this year, Congress is recessing, again, without completing this fundamental task--another duty ignored, another legal requirement violated. 
I hope that as Congress returns from its Memorial Day break it will complete work on a balanced budget to serve the American people without additional delay. It should be balanced in two senses: It should be a balanced series of proposals to meet the health, education, environmental and law enforcement needs of the country. And it will also, for the first time in almost three decades, be a balanced budget that will not rely on deficit financing. 
I recall all too well last year when we were told that we could never achieve a balanced budget without a constitutional amendment. I recall the stacks of deficit-laden federal budgets proposed by Republican and Democratic Presidents since President Johnson and being told that the only answer to annual budget deficits was to pass an ill-conceived constitutional amendment whose terms and effects could not be explained. I defended the Constitution then and this year President Clinton sent us the first balanced budget in almost 30 years. 
With the cooperation of the Republican leadership in the Congress we can enact the first balanced budget since 1969, and we will have done it without inserting a fiscal straightjacket into the text of the United States Constitution. They said it could not be done, but it can and will as a result of the sound fiscal policies of this Administration which have lead not only to balance but to the prospect of budget surplus. In 1993, a Democratic Congress put us on the right road to fiscal responsibility when we took the hard votes and passed the President's plan. Congress should culminate that extraordinary 5-year effort without further delay. 
Completing action on the budget is the first step toward Congress taking action on the annual appropriations bills that are so important to the government programs that protect the environment and assist State and local governments with education and law enforcement. Republican Congressional leadership is well-known for shutting down the government by not completing work on these basic measures in a timely way. 
Those contracting with the government, working in partnership with government services and those dependent on government services deserve better. Americans deserve piece of mind and the assurances that their government is working. Congress needs to complete its appropriations so that the agencies and service providers can plan programs, pay staff and work with the American public in an effective manner. 
It is high time for the congressional leadership to do its job and for the Congress to get on about the business of governing. 
Congress should not be taking breaks without having completed the work of the people. Such callous disregard for the needs of the American people has become too much the rule as year after year under Republican leadership Congress recesses without having completed its work on emergency supplementals, budgets, and appropriations bills. 
The Senate has also failed to take action to end the judicial emergency in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On March 25, the five continuing vacancies on the 13-member court caused Chief Judge Ralph Winter to certify a Circuit emergency, to begin canceling hearings and to take the unprecedented step of having 3-judge panels convened that include only one Second Circuit judge. 
I have been urging favorable Senate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit to fill a longstanding vacancy. That nomination remains stalled on the Senate calendar. Before the last recess I introduced legislation calling upon the Senate to address this kind of judicial emergency before it takes another extended recess. The Senate has pending before it four outstanding nominees to the Second Circuit whose confirmations would end this crisis. 
Unfortunately Republican Senate leadership has not taken the judicial vacancies crisis seriously and has failed to take the concerted action needed to end it. They continue to perpetuate vacancies in almost one in 10 federal judgeships. 
With 11 nominees on the Senate calendar and 32 pending in Committee, we could be making a difference if we would take our responsibilities to the federal courts seriously and devote the time necessary to consider these nominations and confirm them. Instead, we are having hearings at a rate of one a month, barely keeping up with attrition and hardly making a dent in the vacancies crisis that the Chief Justice of the United States has called the most serious problem confronting the judiciary. 
We began this legislative year prepared finally to make progress on issues like campaign finance reform, tobacco legislation and juvenile crime legislation. Republican leadership has lead to inaction on all three. 
On the issue of campaign finance reform, Democrats and some notable Republicans have been prepared to attack the soft money that so pervades the current system. Rather than close the loopholes and correct the system, the Republican leadership has chosen to close the debate and perpetuate the status quo. 
On tobacco legislation, we have an important opportunity to make real progress. Now that the courts have moved to disclose the secret documents from the industry's efforts to hide the nature of nicotine addiction and their marketing efforts to children, now that the tobacco companies' lobbying stranglehold on Congress has been loosened, and now that we have demonstrated that the majority of the Senate agrees with Senator Gregg and me that we need not grant special legal protections to tobacco companies in order to enact legislation that can make a difference, it is time for the Senate to move forward. We should be passing strong tobacco legislation. 
Since the first week of the year I have been urging attention to the matter of juvenile crime. When the Judiciary Committee reported a misguided bill last year, I noted the improvements that had been made in the Committee's consideration and the aspects that needed to change for us to develop a legislative consensus that could help State and local law enforcement in the battle against juvenile crime. 
We have heard for months this would be a priority this Congress. Instead of reaching across the aisle and working to develop a consensus, some have limited themselves to Republican-only Dear Colleague letters and seeking to pick off a few Democratic allies. Juvenile crime should not be a Republican or Democratic issue. There are things we can do to assist State and local law enforcement without partisanship and by consensus. 
Afterschool programs and crime prevention programs should be central to those efforts. I hope that the Senate Republican leadership will join in a truly bipartisan effort. 
We still face the same problems and challenges with which we began the year. We need to make progress on encryption policy and we need to promote personal privacy in the electronic age. 
Given the lack of attention to congressional responsibilities and the real problems of working families in the first half of this session, I fear what the remainder of this year may hold. 
I expect the Republican leadership will find time for some carefully choreographed media efforts and will make time for more personal attacks against the President and the First Lady. In an election year, I will not be surprised if they look to rewrite the Constitution of the United States through a series of popular-sounding amendments. 
I hope that the Republican majority will find the time to make progress on the legislative agenda that can make a difference in the lives of American people and lead to economic opportunity in the coming century.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sure my friend from Oklahoma will allow me to describe what my position will be on it, and I appreciate him stating it. And I do not want to get into the debate he and the Senator from North Dakota have been having. I was here to support, as I have, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. And what I have before me is an amendment that I think makes a great deal of sense. 
I said yesterday that nobody is running up to me in the streets of Vermont and saying, `Oh, please, whatever you do, be sure and give a lot of immunity to the poor tobacco companies.' Nobody in Vermont is saying, `Whatever you do, make sure first and foremost you protect the tobacco companies.' 
They have made it very clear that they are concerned with protecting teenagers, concerned with protecting their children, concerned with getting back some of the costs that we in Vermont have spent on health care for those who have suffered from addiction to cigarettes. 
But I ask, Mr. President, at the conclusion of my statement that I be allowed to put in the Record a letter from C. Everett Koop and David Kessler to Senator Gregg and myself dated May 20, 1998.

Mr. LEAHY. I just mention this about it. The letter very forcefully, very eloquently makes the case why the interests of public health are not served by giving big tobacco further special legal protection. They write: 
Special legal protections for tobacco are unfair to patients and their families. 
They write further: 
Special legal protections for tobacco are bad for public health, especially children's health. 
They write: 
Special legal protections for tobacco are undeserved. 
And they write: 
If passed, the special legal protections in the Commerce Committee bill would be the biggest corporate giveaway in history. 
And then they say: 
For the sake of public health and children's health, for the sake of the people who are already sick and for those who will become sick, and for the sake of holding the industry accountable for its actions, we urge you to strip the special legal protections from the bill. 
I agree with Dr. Koop. I agree with Dr. Kessler. I agree that first and foremost we should protect the people of this country. We should protect the health of the people of this country. We should protect the children of this country. And we should not be giving special limits on legal liability to big tobacco. 
I disagree with the position of the White House in trying to allow special legal protection and special immunity for the tobacco companies. 
Yesterday, the President wrote to the Senate leaders that: 
If a cap that doesn't prevent anybody from suing the companies and getting whatever damages a jury awards will get tobacco companies to stop marketing cigarettes to kids, then it is well worth it for the American people. 
Everybody agrees with that. What doesn't come out in the President's letter is this bill does have provisions that will prevent some parties from suing the tobacco industry. It does cap the total annual payments for the tobacco industry. The liability cap may very well affect the payment of future jury awards to tobacco victims. 
So, I disagree with the White House and I disagree with those on both sides of the aisle who would limit some of the liability of the tobacco companies. If the tobacco companies hadn't faced unlimited liability for their actions, we would not even be here today. If the tobacco companies hadn't known that they could be sued, and sued successfully, they never would have admitted some of the things that have now come out. If the tobacco companies had not faced this, we never would have found out the years that they had lied. We never would have found out the internal memos where they were targeting 14-year-olds. We never would have found out even such things as their efforts to make cigarette placements in all kinds of movies, including, of all things, the `Muppet Movie.' These are things that we have found out only because they face that liability. 
I concur with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I am opposed to limiting liability. With that, I yield the floor. 
Exhibit 1 ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON TOBACCO 
Policy and Public Health, May 20, 1998. 
Dear Senator Gregg and Senator Leahy: We are writing to endorse and support the Gregg-Leahy amendment to S. 1415 to eliminate all special liability protections for tobacco companies. We wish you success and would urge your colleagues to join with you in this effort. 
Special legal protections for tobacco are unfair to patients and their families. 
Millions of Americans are now sick with tobacco-related illnesses. Millions more will become sick in the future. These are people who started to smoke at a time when the tobacco industry lied about its products, hid scientific studies, and shredded documents. Most of these people started to smoke when they were children whom the industry targeted for special marketing. To protect the industry now would leave many of these patients, their families, and their survivors without remedy. 
Special legal protections for tobacco are bad for public health, especially children's health. 
Court oversight in the historic Minnesota suit led to the disclosure of thousands of documents about the addictiveness of nicotine and about the industry's plans to market to children. Other legal actions have resulted in consent decrees that will cut back on Big Tobacco's seduction of new young smokers. Under the Commerce Committee bill, these state and local suits would be impossible. 
Special legal protections for tobacco are undeserved. 
The tobacco industry has proven itself to be an irresponsible corporate citizen. Extending protection to this industry would be to subsidize and condone these activities. No other industry, no matter how valuable to the Nation, has such protections. We should not extend them to an industry whose product that serves only to kill Americans prematurely. 
The Senate should not provide special legal protections for tobacco. 
If an American jury finds tobacco companies owe damages, the Senate should not overturn that verdict. 
If the most skilled lawyers that money can buy cannot get the tobacco industry out of court, the Senate should not become its defenders. 
If passed, the special protections contained in the Commerce Committee bill would be the biggest corporate giveaway in history. 
For the sake of public health and children's health, for the sake of the people who are already sick and those who will become sick, and for the sake of holding the industry accountable for its actions, we urge you to strip the special legal protections from the bill. 
Sincerely, 
C. EVERETT KOOP, M.D.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, April 10, 1998 was not only Good Friday and Passover for millions of people around the world. It was a day that marked a beginning for the people of Northern Ireland. A beginning on a path toward peace after thirty long years of civil conflict that claimed over 3000 lives. Although a great deal of work lies ahead to ensure that the peace agreement signed in Belfast is adopted by all parties and faithfully implemented, the agreement is an achievement of immense historic significance. 
Over the years, like so many Americans who are proud of their Irish heritage, I have wondered if I would live to see this day. Some years ago, not long after the first cease-fire began, I traveled to Northern Ireland and met with both Catholics and Protestants. Both longed for peace. Both asked me to urge President Clinton, who had taken a chance for peace when he granted a visa to Gerry Adams, to stay the course. We all knew there would be setbacks. We knew more innocent blood would be lost. But while some longed for a past that was gone and others for a future that could never be, most knew that violence could not bring peace and that the only way to a better life was through compromise. 
The April 10th agreement represents the culmination of a tremendous amount of effort, and a great deal of courage, by many people. As party leaders, John Hume, whom I consider it a great privilege to call a friend, Gerry Adams, and David Trimble brought their constituents' longing for peace to the negotiating table and understood the responsibility history had thrust upon them and the need to find the middle ground. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, deserve enormous praise for putting the full weight of their offices and their personal reputations behind the negotiations. 
Several other people I want to pay tribute to are former Irish Prime Ministers Albert Reynolds and John Bruton, and former Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who put the peace process in motion and labored day and night to keep it moving forward despite setbacks. Throughout this period Former Irish Ambassador Dermot Gallagher and his successor Sean O'Huiginn played a critical role keeping us informed here in Washington as they worked to further the peace process. 
But I want to make particular mention of our former Senate colleague, George Mitchell, whose wisdom, steady perseverance and total dedication to the cause of peace enabled the parties to find a way to put the years of hatred behind them and look to a new day. 
Senator Mitchell came from humble beginnings. Born to Lebanese and Irish immigrants in rural Maine, he worked his way through Bowdoin College and Georgetown Law School. As a federal judge and from the time he joined the Senate in 1982, he demonstrated patience, even-handedness and commitment to the public good. As Majority Leader, he served as an articulate national spokesman, a trusted colleague and a good friend. 
As the first serving U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, President Clinton made a commitment to the peace process early on, courageously put his prestige on the line by granting a visa to Gerry Adams, and showed great foresight in his appointment of Senator Mitchell as chairman of the negotiations. As I said at that time, I could not have imagined a person better suited to bring the sides together and forge a common path to the future. George Mitchell managed to do what many in the foreign policy establishment said was impossible. As the crafter of the agreement, he has given hope to millions of Irish citizens, and in doing so he has shown the world that even the most seemingly intractable conflicts, even the most bitter hatred, can be overcome.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate's Republican leadership is refusing to take action to end the judicial emergency in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
On March 25, the five continuing vacancies on the 13-member court caused Chief Judge Ralph Winter to certify a Circuit emergency, to begin canceling hearings and to take the unprecedented step of having 3-judge panels convened that include only one Second Circuit judge. On April 23, Chief Judge Winter was forced to issue additional emergency orders. For two months and into the foreseeable future the Senate has neglected its responsibility to the people of the Second Circuit. 
I have been urging favorable Senate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit to fill a longstanding vacancy for many months. That nomination remains stalled on the Senate calendar. Two weeks ago the nomination of Chester J. Straub to the Second Circuit was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. That nomination is now also on the Senate calendar awaiting action. Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee is favorably reporting two additional nominees to the Second Circuit, Judge Rosemary Pooler and Robert Sack. That makes four nominees to the Second Circuit awaiting confirmation, four nominees who can end the judicial vacancies crisis that plagues the Second Circuit. But for the inaction of the Majority Leader in calling for votes by the Senate on this qualified nominees, the crisis could end this week. I, again, urge that action. 
Before the last recess I introduced legislation calling upon the Senate to address this kind of judicial emergency before it takes another extended recess. The Senate has pending before it four outstanding nominees to the Second Circuit whose confirmations would end this crisis. 
Unfortunately Republican Senate leadership has not taken the judicial vacancies crisis seriously and has failed to take the concerted action needed to end it. They continue to perpetuate vacancies in almost one in 10 federal judgeships. 
With 11 nominees on the Senate calendar and 32 pending in Committee, we could be making a difference if we would take our responsibilities to the federal courts seriously and devote the time necessary to consider these nominations and confirm them. Instead, we are having hearings at a rate on one a month, barely keeping up with attrition and hardly making a dent in the vacancies crisis that the Chief Justice of the United States has called the most serious problem confronting the judiciary. 
By a vote of 16 to 2, the Judiciary Committee reported the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Senate. That was on March 5, 1998, over two months ago. No action has been 
taken or scheduled on that nomination and no explanation for the delay has been forthcoming. This is the oldest judicial nomination pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. In spite of an April 8 letter to the Senate Republican Leader signed by all six Senators from the three States forming the Second Circuit urging prompt action, this nomination continues to be stalled by anonymous objections. Our bipartisan letter to the Majority Leader asked that he call up for prompt consideration by the Senate the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. That was over one month ago. 
Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton University and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the New York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney and was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is strongly support by Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato. 
She is a source of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women. When confirmed she will be only the second woman and second judge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit. 
Judge Rosemary Pooler was nominated back on November 6, 1997, as was Robert Sack, a partner in the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. They participated in a confirmation hearing on May 14 and were reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee today. 
Since May 7 the fourth pending nomination to the Second Circuit, that of Chester J. Straub, has also been on the Senate calendar. Mr. Straub is a partner in the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher. 
Judge Sotomayor, Judge Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub can and should all be confirmed to the Second Circuit before the Senate adjourns for its Memorial Day recess. 
In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned that persisting vacancies would harm the administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly declared: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' 
The people and businesses in the Second Circuit need additional federal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the 5 vacancies, the Second Circuit be allocated an additional 2 judgeships to handle its workload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from Senate inaction. That is why the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit had to declare the Circuit in a state of emergency. 
Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the nominees pending before it? I pray not.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment of my friend and my neighbor from New Hampshire. I was thinking about this. I thought to myself, why should we give big tobacco any special legal protections? My friend from New Hampshire said that we are not doing this for a medical company because they build some new kind of heart valve, and to get it out, we will give them special protection; 
or somebody else comes up with a new cancer drug and we want to give them special protection. We are being asked to give this special protection to tobacco. I have to tell you, Mr. President, I don't have a whole lot of people in Vermont rushing up to me and saying, `Oh, please, please, please, give immunity to the tobacco companies. This is our No. 1 priority.' 
In fact, this is whom they are asking to give immunity to. Mr. President, look at this stellar group standing, raising their hand, swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, and then they sat down and lied. I remember my days as a prosecutor. We used to see lineups like that, but they were usually a different type of lineup and you had numbers across the front. 
These are not the people I want to give immunity to. These are not the people I want to go back home to Vermont and say, `I voted to give them immunity.' In fact, yesterday the former Surgeon General, Everett Koop, and the former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Kessler, endorsed the Gregg-Leahy amendment because they know Congress can protect the public health without having to protect big tobacco. 
This really comes down to the issue of, Do you have to protect big tobacco in order to protect public health? I say no. What we should be doing is protecting public health, that is it, not protecting big tobacco. 
Now, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, and the White House have done a great job in narrowing the list of special legal protections in the managers' amendment, and I compliment Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and the White House for what they have done. But now that the Senate begins floor debate on this revised bill, we have to go beyond that. We have to take the great work that my neighbor from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and the others I have named have done. Then we have to say, once and for all, we are rejecting the tobacco industry's siren song for unprecedented legal protections. 
I applaud Senator Kerry and Senator McCain and Senator Hollings and the White House for going as far as they did, but I want to now go further, lock the door, close the door once and for all, and allow us all to go back home to our States and say we stood up to big tobacco, we voted against immunity. It is time for Congress, and especially the Senate, to scrap the last remnants of the original sweetheart deal of immunity for the tobacco industry. That was the sweetheart deal that was in the proposed national settlement. 
In theory, the tobacco industry will restrict its future advertising in exchange for legal protections from past punitive damages and other past and future damages. I reject this mirage of a deal because it will evaporate in a court of law. Any affected industry that is or is not part of the deal, such as a retailer or distributor or even a tobacco company, might sue to block these restrictions as being in violation of the first amendment. 
Many advertising experts, including the head of the Federal Trade Commission, predict such a suit will succeed in throwing out the advertising restrictions as unconstitutional. In the end, Congress will have been duped again by the tobacco industry. They will have given unprecedented legal protections in exchange for empty promises. They will have said, `You guys fooled us before when you testified under oath, but we know you have now found religion and you are going to be fined this time 
and you haven't fooled us again.' It reminds me of Charlie Brown and the football: `Don't worry, Charlie Brown, I won't pull the ball out this time.' And we see that, of course, every year. Out goes the football, and flat on his back goes Charlie Brown. 
Well, let's not do that to the people of this country. We have learned a lot more about the industry's schemes. We have seen what Attorney General Skip Humphrey in Minnesota has pried loose from the hundreds of thousands of internal tobacco documents. Let's take a look at some of this. 
Let's look at some of these things that came out of Minnesota, the released tobacco documents. Now, this is just marketing that is aimed at children. Look at this one:  
To ensure increased and longer-term growth of Camel Filter, the brand must increase its share penetration among the 14-24 age group which represents tomorrow's cigarette business. 
Mr. President, this is not a typographical error. They are talking about how they will increase--not just to start people at 14 years old but how they will increase the market among 14-year-olds. 
Philip Morris starts off being a little bit more responsible by saying: 
Marlboro dominates in the 17-- 
But then we see-- 
and younger age category. 
RJR `Product Research Report': 
Salem King shows encouraging growth by posting a four point gain in the 14-17 market. 
You wonder if whoever wrote this about encouraging growth, do they have children of their own? Do they have children of their own that they would brag about that? 
Or look at Brown & Williamson: 
At the present rate a smoker in the 16-25 year age group will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect in any other broad age category. 
Again, Mr. President, as a parent, I find this reprehensible. To them this was just marketing, and is that the kind of conduct that we should reward with unprecedented legal protection, that we should reward people who target 14-year-olds? To use the language of the same 14-year-olds, get real. We can't do it. If we grant immunity to this special rogue industry, we have lost all our common sense. 
But if we go with the bill as now written, we will establish an $8 billion annual cap on damages for tobacco claims. That is about $20,000 per family for the 400,000 Americans who die from tobacco-related diseases each year. These are special provisions. They are unnecessary. Why should the industry stop marketing to children? Why should they stop manipulating nicotine? Why should they stop cutting health research when they know this liability cannot exceed a certain amount? If they know the liability is capped, then it just becomes a marketing ploy. 
Some might say, `Well, they would not do that because they promised us.' This is like saying the check is in the mail, I gave at the office, or a few other versions of that. Why should anybody trust them? I do not. A liability cap eliminates the incentive for the tobacco industry to change its corporate culture. It is kind of like having two warehouses side by side and one has got locks on the doors and one doesn't. And you have somebody who is inclined toward burglarizing a place, and they say, `Oh, I promised not to burgle those places.' Well, they are not telling us the truth. We know which one they are going to go into. They are going to go into the warehouse without the lock. Let's put some locks on it. 
I think, if you don't have the incentive of real liability facing them, the promises they make to get the Congress off their backs today are the promises that will be forgotten tomorrow. If big tobacco could turn its liability exposure to fixed costs which they could pass on to consumers and taxpayers, then they can keep on doing business as usual without the risk of litigation. 
How will the liability cap work? Will it reward today's plaintiffs at the expense of future injured parties? Because most lawsuits settle, I believe the tobacco industry will have a unique negotiating edge if they have a liability cap. The industry will have every incentive to do sweetheart deals with favorite plaintiffs--do that first, then use the prospect of delayed payments in the future to force smaller settlements. A payment delayed will result in justice denied for thousands of tobacco victims. 
I said earlier, each week, when I go back home, I don't have a lot of my fellow Vermonters coming up to me and saying, `Hey, Pat, give immunity to the tobacco industry.' We Vermonters are known for our common sense. My fellow Vermonters are telling me that immunity for big tobacco makes no sense. In fact, the Vermont legislature overwhelmingly, Republicans and Democrats alike, passed a resolution condemning any immunity for the tobacco industry in Federal legislation. I think that is because the American people outside the beltway understand that big tobacco does not deserve any special legal protections. 
I take seriously the admonition of Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, whom I respect greatly, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee last year that the proposed settlement offers Congress a historic opportunity to seize the moment and protect the health of future generations. But I believe that we can seize this historic opportunity to curb teenage smoking without giving big tobacco any special legal protection. Under our amendment, a State may resolve its attorney general's suit or take on the tobacco industry in court, as Minnesota did. It is up to the people of that State, instead of Washington. That is the same approach used in the Conrad bill that has, I think, 32 cosponsors. 
I am confident in my State of Vermont, Attorney General William Sorrell knows the facts in his lawsuit against big tobacco. He is going to weigh the interest of Vermonters in deciding to opt out of the bill's settlement provisions. As one Vermonter, I am perfectly willing to put that decision in the hands of our elected officials in our State. 
Our approach puts the interests of the children ahead of the interests of the tobacco lobby. The public health community agrees that immunity for the tobacco industry makes no sense. The Advisory Committee on Tobacco Policy and Public Health, headed by Drs. Koop and Kessler, wrote to Congress:  
We oppose granting the tobacco industry immunity against liability for past, present or future misdeeds. Congress should focus its efforts on public health, not on the concessions the tobacco industry seeks. 
I agree. I agree. Dr. Koop called a liability cap a huge corporate giveaway. He is right. I agree. After all, the only reason we are here--and it is really a credit to it--is our civil justice system. In fact, without the use of class actions, without the likelihood of punitive damage recoveries, we all know tobacco companies never would have come to the negotiating table. So let's not change our successful State-based tort 
system as it involves tobacco legislation. It has served us well. After all, the same people who were in the picture I showed earlier, raising their hands, swearing they will tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth so help me--and I think they were swearing on a tobacco leaf because now the Department of Justice is currently investigating them for criminal conspiracy and perjury. I would say, if I can move that metaphor a little bit further, strip away the tobacco leaf and see what is hidden behind it. I am not going to give legal immunity to the same people who appeared here and lied to Congress while under oath. 
Why in the world do we want to give big tobacco such legal protections? Rely on common sense. Rely on the things I hear from my fellow Vermonters as I am in the grocery stores back home. Rely on what I hear, as I am walking down the street, from Vermonters of all political persuasions. Rely on the common sense I hear from my neighbors and friends of a lifetime back home. Then we will reject the unprecedented legal protections for the tobacco industry, and we will vote for the Gregg-Leahy amendment. 
I believe it makes sense. I certainly find myself in total agreement with what the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, said. That is the way I feel about it. 
I understand from earlier discussions with the distinguished leader we may not vote on this today; we may vote on it tomorrow. But whenever we do, think what is in the best interests of the country. Think what is in the best interests of the people. And think, every Senator, how you would answer this question when you go home if you are asked: Are you willing to give immunity, even limited immunity, to the tobacco companies or not? If you are not, then you vote for this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we complete the last step to enact the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 that I introduced with Senator Hatch and Senator Campbell last January. Our bipartisan legislation is intended to save the lives of law enforcement officers across the country by helping state and local law enforcement agencies provide their officers with body armor. When we began Senate consideration I urged action by this week, National Police Week. It is appropriate on the day of the Seventeenth Peace Officers' Memorial Service that along with honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the interest of preserving the public safety, we in Congress do all that we can to protect our law enforcement officers. 
Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year while serving to protect our citizens. Just yesterday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that 64 law enforcement officers were slain feloniously in the line of duty in 1997, up from 56 in 1996. And some of these deaths might have been prevented if officers were wearing body armor. 
According to the FBI, more than 30 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
Unfortunately, far too many state and local law enforcement agencies cannot afford to provide every officer in their jurisdictions with the protection of body armor. In fact, the Department of Justice estimates that approximately 150,000 State and local law enforcement officers, nearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor. 
A recent incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border underscores the need for the quick passage of this legislation to provide maximum protection to those who protect us. On August 19, 1997, Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New Hampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. This madman had just shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two other victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with the authorities, Drega lost his life. 
During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore bulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For example, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, who was seriously wounded in the incident. If it was not for his bulletproof vest, I would have been attending Officer Pfeifer's wake instead of visiting him, and meeting his wife and young daughter in the hospital a few days later. 
The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega were not so lucky. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective vests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous officers because of the high-powered assault weapons used by this madman. But the tragedy underscores the point that all of our law enforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the protection of a bulletproof vest. 
I am relieved that Officer John Pfeifer is doing well and is back on duty. We all grieve for the two New Hampshire officers who were killed. With that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law enforcement officers. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 will create a new partnership between the federal government and State and local law enforcement agencies to help save the lives of police officers by providing the resources for each and every law enforcement officer to have a bulletproof vest. Our bipartisan bill would create a $25 million matching grant program within the Department of Justice dedicated to helping State and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor. 
Action today would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of Congressman Visclosky, Congressman LoBiondo, and the more than 300 bipartisan cosponsors they assembled for their companion legislation in the House of Representatives. The endorsement and support of many law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the International Union of Police Associations, the Police Executive Research Forum, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the National Association of Police Organizations have all been critical to focusing attention on this important initiative. In my home State of Vermont, the bill enjoys the strong support of Attorney General William Sorrell, the Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law enforcement officials. 
Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes to our attention. 
Our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be `routine.' Each and every law enforcement officer across the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest. 
I am glad that the bill we enact today returns to the Senate bill from the version hastily substituted in a House committee. We include rather than exclude corrections officers. We include rather than exclude Indian tribes. We include a small State minimum to ensure that Vermont and other small States not lose out to their larger neighbors but are enabled to participate to at least a minimum extend in the program. We have been able to achieve quick passage because we have compromised to achieve consensus. Earlier this week, the House of Representatives passed our bill by a vote of 412-4. 
I am also glad that we have been able to proceed this week to enact the Care for Police Survivors Act, which I cosponsored with Senators Hatch, Biden, DeWine and Sessions as S.1985. This measure will change a ceiling into a floor for the Public Safety Officers Benefits program. Counseling services will not longer be capped at $150,000 a year. 
The unfortunate reality of contemporary life is that we may still lose upwards of 100 law enforcement officers a year nationwide. I wish there were none and I will keep working to improve the assistance and support we provide our law enforcement officers. For those families that sacrifice a loved one in the line of duty I support the additional counseling services that could be made available by the Care for Police Survivors Act. 
I hope the House of Representatives will also proceed this week to provide the college education assistance that would be made possible for the families of State and local law enforcement officers killed or disabled in the line of duty by the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act, S. 1525. I am proud to have cosponsored the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996 and the pending bill that would extend the educational benefits that we previously provided to the children of federal law enforcement to the families of State and local public safety officials who die or are disabled in the line of duty. Those families make the ultimate sacrifice for our public safety and deserve our support and assistance. I commend Senator Specter and Senator Biden for their leadership on this effort. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee reported this bill to the Senate last Thursday. I said then that I hoped it could be included in a package of legislation passed this week. A fitting tribute to those who gave their lives in preserving our public safety would be for Congress to enact during National Police Week and in anticipation of the annual memorial activities for law enforcement officers the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, S.1605; the Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, S.1985 (or H.R. 3565 its House counterpart); and the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act, S.1525. Together these make a significant package of legislation to benefit the families of those who serve in law enforcement. 
I am encouraged that we have been able to achieve enactment of two of these three measures and look forward to enactment of the third, that to provide educational opportunities to the families of State and local law enforcement officers, as soon as the House is prepared to proceed.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for his gracious comments, and I do appreciate working with him on this matter. He and I have discussed this so many times in walking back and forth to votes and in the committee room, and so on. I think the Senator from Utah and I long ago determined that if we were going to have this WIPO implementing bill passed, its best chance would be one where the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont were basically holding hands on it. 
The Senator from Utah may recall a time once when the then-Senator from Nevada, Senator Laxalt, and I were here and we had two pieces of legislation, a Laxalt-Leahy bill and a Leahy-Laxalt bill. One of our colleagues said, `This is either a very good bill or one of you didn't read.' 
In this case, the Hatch-Leahy-et al. piece of legislation is a very good bill, and one which the two of us have read every word. We have tried to make very clear to the Senate that the issues we are raising in this bill are not partisan issues. These are issues that create jobs in the United States. These are issues that allow the United States to go into the next century with our innovative genius in place. These are issues that allow the United States, in creating that innovative genius, to continue to lead the world. Senators, in voting for this legislation, will be voting to maintain the intellectual leadership of the United States. 
The successful adoption by the World Intellectual Property Organization, what we call WIPO, in December 1996, of two new copyright treaties--one on written material and one on sound recordings--was praised in the United States. The bill that we have before us today, the DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, will effectuate the purposes of those treaties in the United States and, I believe, will serve as a model for the rest of the world. 
The WIPO treaties will fortify intellectual property rights around the world. They will help unleash the full potential of America's most creative industries, including the movie, recording, computer software, and other copyrighted industries that are subject to online and other forms of piracy, especially in the digital age where it is easier to pirate and steal exact copies of works. 
If they don't have the protection, the owners of intellectual property are going to be unwilling to put their material online. If there is no content worth reading online, then the growth and usefulness of the Internet will be stifled and public accessibility will be retarded. 
Secretary Daley of the Department of Commerce said, for the most part, `The treaties largely incorporate intellectual property norms that are already part of U.S. law.' What the treaties will do is give American owners of copyrighted material an important tool to protect their intellectual property in those countries that become a party to the treaties. 
With ever-expanding electronic commerce, trafficking the global superhighway, international copyright standards are critical to protecting American firms and American jobs. The future growth of the Internet and of digital media requires rigorous international intellectual property protections. 
I have in my hand the 1998 Report on Copyright Industries in the United States Economy. This was released last week by the International Intellectual Property Alliance. 
This report shows conclusively just how important the U.S. copyright industries are to American jobs and how important it is to protect that U.S. copyright industry from global piracy. 
If you look at the chart over here, Mr. President, it shows that from the years 1977 to 1996, the U.S. copyright industries' share of the gross national product grew more than twice as fast as the rest of the economy. 
These are the core copyright industries. Look how fast they grew as compared to the rest of the U.S. economy. 
One of the things that has expanded and fueled our expanding economy is the copyright industry. 
Now, during those same 20 years, job growth in the core copyright industries was nearly three times as fast as the rest of the economy. What this shows us, Mr. President, is that we are undergoing unprecedented expansion of our economy, but this is the area expanding the fastest. 
These statistics underscore why, when the President transmitted the two WIPO treaties and draft legislation to implement the treaties to the U.S. Senate, I was proud to introduce the implementing legislation, S. 1121, with Senators Hatch, Thompson, and Kohl. We did it the same day. The legislation we have before us today is the result of years of work domestically and internationally to ensure that the appropriate copyright protections are in place around the world to foster the growth of the Internet and other digital media and networks. 
The Clinton administration showed great foresight when it formed, in 1993, the Information Infrastructure Task Force, IITF, which established a Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights to examine and recommend changes to keep copyright law current with new technology. Then they released a report in 1995 explaining the importance of this effort, stating:  
The full potential of the NII will not be realized if the education, information and entertainment products protected by intellectual property laws are not protected. . . 
The report said further: 
All the computers, telephones, fax machines, scanners, cameras, keyboards, televisions, monitors, printers, switches, routers, wires, cables, networks, and satellites in the world will not create a successful NII, if there is no content. What will drive the NII is the content moving through it. 
The same year that report was issued, Senator Hatch and I joined together to introduce the NII Copyright Protection Act of 1995, S. 1284, which incorporated the recommendations of the Administration. That legislative proposal confronted fundamental questions about the role of copyright in the next century--many of which are echoed by the DMCA, which we consider today. 
Title I of the DMCA is based on the Administration's recommendations for legislation to implement the two WIPO treaties. It makes certain technical changes to conform our copyright laws to the treaties and substantive amendments to comply with two new treaty obligations. 
Specifically, the treaties oblige the signatories to provide legal protections against circumvention of technological measures used by copyright owners to protect their works, and against violations of the integrity of copyright management information (CMI). Such information is used to identify a work, its author, the copyright owner and any information about the terms and conditions of use of the work. The bill adds a new chapter to U.S. copyright law to implement the anticircum-vention and CMI provisions, along with corresponding civil and criminal penalties. 
Title II of the DMCA limits the liability for copyright infringement, under certain conditions, for Internet and online service providers. Title III gives a Copyright Act exemption to lawful computer owners or lessees so that independent technicians may service the machines without infringement liability. 
Title IV begins a process of updating our Nation's copyright laws with respect to library archives, and educational uses of copyrighted works in the digital age. 
Title I is based on the administration's recommendations, as I said. 
Following intensive discussions with a number of interested parties, including libraries, universities, small businesses, ISPs and OSPs, telephone companies, computer users, broadcasters, content providers, and device manufacturers, we in the Senate Judiciary Committee were able to reach unanimous agreement. 
For example, significant provisions were added to the bill in Title II to clarify the liability for copyright infringement of online and Internet service providers. The bill provides `safe harbors' from liability under clearly defined circumstances, which both encourage responsible behavior and protect important intellectual property rights. In addition, during the committee's consideration of this bill, an Ashcroft-Leahy-Hatch amendment was adopted to ensure that computer users are given reasonable notice when their Web sites are the subject of infringement complaints, and to provide procedures for computer users to have material that is mistakenly taken down put back online. 
We have a number of provisions designed to help libraries and archives. First, libraries expressed concerns about the possibility of criminal sanctions or potentially ruinous monetary liability for actions taken in good faith. This bill makes sure that libraries acting in good faith can never be subject to fines or civil damages. Specifically, a library is exempt from monetary liability in a civil suit if it was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation. In addition, libraries are completely exempt from the criminal provisions. 
We have a `browsing' exception for libraries so they can look at encrypted work and decide whether or not they want to purchase it for their library. 
Senator Hatch, Senator Ashcroft, and I crafted an amendment to provide for the preservation of digital works by qualified libraries and archives. The ability of libraries to preserve legible copies of works in digital form is one I consider critical. Under present law, libraries are permitted to make a single facsimile copy for their collections for preservation purposes, or to replace copies in case of fire and so on. That worked back in the nondigital age. It does not work today. This gives us a chance to be up to date. We would allow libraries to transfer a work from one digital format to another if the equipment needed to read the earlier format becomes unavailable commercially. 
The bill ensures that libraries' collections will continue to be available to future generations by permitting libraries to make up to three copies in any format--including in digital form. This was one of the proposals in The National Information Infrastructure (NII) Copyright Protection Act of 1995, which I sponsored with Senator Hatch in the last Congress. The Register of Copyrights, among others, has supported that proposal. 
These provisions go a long way toward meeting the concerns that libraries have expressed about the original implementing legislation we introduced. 
We address distance learning. When Congress enacted the present copyright law it recognized the potential of broadcast and cable technology to supplement classroom teaching, and to bring the classroom to those who, because of their disabilities or other special circumstances, are unable to attend classes. At the same time, Congress also recognized the potential for unauthorized transmissions of works to harm the markets for educational uses of copyrighted materials. The present Copyright Act strikes a careful balance and includes a narrowly crafted exemption. 
As with so many areas of copyright law, the advent of digital technology requires us to take another look at the issue. 
I recognize that the issue of distance learning has been under consideration for the past several years by the Conference on Fair Use (CONFU) that was established by the Administration to consider how to protect fair use in the digital environment. In spite of the hard work of the participants, CONFU has so far been unable to forge a comprehensive agreement on guidelines for the application of fair use to digital distance learning. 
We made tremendous strides in the Committee to chart the appropriate course for updating the Copyright Act to permit the use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. 
Senator Hatch, Senator Ashcroft, and I joined together to ask the Copyright Office to facilitate discussions among interested library and educational groups and content providers with a view toward making recommendations for us to consider with this legislation. We incorporated into the DMCA a new section 122 requiring the Copyright Office to make broader recommendations to Congress on digital distance education within six months. Upon receiving the Copyright Office's recommendations, it is my hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will promptly commence hearings on the issue and move expeditiously to enact further legislation on the matter. I know that all members on this Committee are as anxious as I am to complete the process that we started in Committee of updating the Copyright Act to permit the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. This step should be viewed as a beginning--and we are committed to making more progress as quickly as possible. 
We have also asked the Copyright Office to examine, in a comprehensive fashion, when the actions of a university's employees might jeopardize the university's eligibility for the safe harbors set out in the bill for online service providers. This is an important and complex issue with implications for other online service providers, including libraries and archives, and I look forward to reviewing the Copyright Office's analysis of this issue. 
Amendments sponsored by Senator Ashcroft, Senator Hatch, and I were crafted to address the question of reverse engineering, ephemeral recordings, and to clarify the use of copyright management. 
Finally, to assuage the concerns of the consumer, electronics manufacturers, and others, that the bill might require them to design their products to respond to a particular technological protection measure, Senator Hatch, Senator Ashcroft, and I crafted an amendment to clarify the bill on this issue. 
I mention all of these things, Mr. President, because it shows why the administration has sent a Statement of Administration policy saying the Administration supports passage of this bill. This is a well-balanced package of proposals. As we go into the next century--the creators, the consumers, those in commerce in this country need the best laws possible. The United States is the leader today. The United States will not be the leader tomorrow without adequate laws. 
These laws allow the United States to continue to be the electronic and intellectual property leader of the world. We should pass this bill. We can pass it with pride. 
I would like to close by praising the dedicated staff members from the Judiciary Committee who have assisted us in crafting this legislation. They appreciate the significance of this legislation for our country and its economy. In particular, I want to thank Edward Damich and Troy Dow from the Chairman's staff, and Paul Clement and Bartlett Cleland from Senator Ashcroft's staff, for demonstrating what can be done when we put political party allegiances aside and strive to work together in a bipartisan fashion to craft the best bill possible. My hope is that the bipartisan manner in which they worked on behalf of the Chairman and Senator Ashcroft to bridge differences rather than exacerbate them can be replicated on a number of other important issues 
pending in our Committee. 
I would also like to thank those people on my Judiciary Committee staff--Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Marla Grossman, Bill Bright and Mike Carrasco--for their work on this bill. They each put in long hours to help me find solutions to the concerns of a number of stakeholders in this bill. I could always trust their counsel to be fair and conscientious. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the leader is on the floor--if the Senator from Iowa will withhold for just a moment--I know the leader is trying to get a schedule together. I just wanted to note, because there has been some question over here on this side of the aisle, that on S. 2037, the WIPO bill, or the digital new millennium copyright legislation, there is absolutely no objection to going forward with it. I suggest that there will be unanimous support for it over here. I just wanted to advise the distinguished majority leader of that fact.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, an amendment offered by Senator Feinstein to the anti-`slamming' bill, S. 1618, was passed without debate. While this amendment was intended to enhance the privacy rights of patients, the consequence of this amendment would be far different. Specifically, this amendment would change current federal law and put patients at risk of criminal liability if they record their conversations with health providers and health insurers without first alerting and obtaining the consent of those providers and insurers. 
This Feinstein amendment modifies the wiretap law, in title 18 of the United States Code, but was never considered by the Committee of the Judiciary, which has jurisdiction over this law. The risk of passing legislation quickly and bypassing the Committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter is amply revealed by the unintended consequence of this amendment. 
If this amendment becomes law, the minority rule adopted by only a small number of States--sixteen--requiring the consent of all parties for the lawful interception of telephone calls, would be applied to all conversations that take place between patients and health insurers or providers. There are a number of legitimate reasons for patients to want to record their calls with a health provider or insurer: medical instructions can be complicated. Insurers' explanations of coverage or decisions regarding reimbursement may be complicated. Patients may have sound reasons for recording those conversations if they are unable to take notes or want to keep the oral instructions for future reference. For example, patients, especially Alzheimer sufferers, may want to record their calls as a memory aid, and be too embarrassed to say so. 
A more carefully crafted amendment would have reduced the unwarranted risk of criminal liability to patients. If this provision were to become law, we would have to revisit this issue promptly.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator Lugar and the Ranking Member, Senator Harkin, on the research conference report. 
I want to highlight that over 70 Senators--including myself--signed a letter to the majority leader urging him to give us an opportunity to vote on this conference report as soon as possible. 
The conference agreements we worked out represent a very good package with four major components: crop insurance funding, agricultural research funding, rural development initiatives and food stamp assistance for legal immigrants. 
I know that farmers who need crop insurance are very worried--and with good reason--that crop insurance policies will be canceled if this report does not pass. 
I know that the agricultural research community, with its Land Grant University system, very strongly supports this research funding so that America can be more competitive in world markets. 
In addition to benefiting farmers and the agricultural research community, the report benefits all rural residents thorough its rural development programs. 
Sometimes it is forgotten that most rural Americans are not farmers--this effort benefits both farmers and other rural Americans. 
I also want to speak briefly on the food stamp changes. The food stamp changes simply restore benefits for certain level immigrants. The changes are modeled on last year's Balanced Budget Act that restored eligibility for SSI and Medicaid to some legal immigrants. 
For example, the conference report would apply the provisions in the Balance Budget Act--that extended benefits from 5 years, to 7 years, for refugees and asylum seekers for SSI and Medicaid--to the food stamp program. 
The 1996 welfare law made an exception for these types of refugees because they typically come to this country with very little after escaping persecution abroad. They often have no sponsors. 
In the past many of them fought along with U.S. troops against our common enemies. Some may have escaped from enemy prisoner of war camps. 
That 5-year limit proved unrealistic because of long backlogs at the INS. In a number of INS offices, these backlogs exceeded two years. If the eligibility of these refugees ended after five years in the country, they could be left without recourse while their applications to naturalize were in the INS `pipeline.' 
The extension of eligibility for SSI and Medicaid to allow them to receive benefits during their first seven years in this country was not controversial last year: it was included in all major Republican and Democratic proposals for legal immigrants. 
It should not be controversial this year. 
It should be noted that this provision does not assure that these refugees will receive benefits for two more years--they still have to be otherwise eligible for food stamps. 
Refugees and asylum seekers still would have to meet the same criteria that all other people have to meet to qualify for benefits. 
By conforming food stamp rules to those already adopted for Medicaid last summer, the Agricultural Research Conference Report would avoid imposing multiple inconsistent eligibility rules on state and local agencies that administer both programs. 
I urge my colleagues to support Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin in their efforts to get the agricultural research conference report passed as quickly as possible. America's rural areas, its farmers and the research community are eagerly awaiting passage of this report.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was just thinking, while we are all here, I know we continue to have a number of names on the Executive Calendar on nominations, and we have, let's see, nine judges, all of whom have been voted out of the Judiciary Committee, I think in most cases unanimously. We have close to 100 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. Among those who are on here is Sonia Sotomayor of the second circuit. This has been out for some time now. She has been before the Senate for a couple of years now, I believe. This is a circuit where the Chief Judge has declared a judicial emergency. I believe it is the first time a circuit court has declared a judicial emergency, I think maybe the first time in history that they have done that. 
But what that means is that if you go before the second circuit, you don't even have a panel made up of second circuit judges. You have one second circuit court of appeals judge and two visiting judges. And yet we have two nominees for the second circuit on the Executive Calendar, both of whom could be voted on in the next 5 minutes--they went out of the Judiciary Committee very easily--and it would stop this judicial emergency. 
The reason I mention this, Mr. President, is that with 100 vacancies in the Federal judiciary, nearly 100 vacancies, we are finding around the country that prosecutors have to lower charges; they have to nol-pros cases; they have to plea bargain because they cannot give a speedy trial. So the police go through all the work, the Federal agencies and everybody, to apprehend somebody, and then because we can't guarantee a speedy trial because there are so many vacancies in the Federal court, somebody who has been charged with a crime suddenly sees their charge lowered. If you are a taxpayer and you pay the bill, as we all are for these courts, and you have a case, a civil case, you cannot get it heard for sometimes 2, 3, 4, 5 years. Justice delayed is justice denied. I mention this, Mr. President; I certainly, and I understand everybody on this side of the aisle, would be ready to go ahead and vote up or down every one of these nine judges right now and clear this up.

Mr. LEAHY. If I might say to my friend from Kentucky, the irony is that Margaret Hornbeck Greene, if there was to be a vote on her, would get every vote in this place. So instead, what you have is somebody in the back recesses of a cloakroom somewhere holding this woman up, as are a whole lot of other women on this list being held up by people who say, `We won't vote on these women. We just won't let them come to a vote.' 
Nobody is going to vote them down. They are all going to be confirmed, if we have a vote. But these women are all being held up by somebody who will not come in the Chamber and say who it is holding them up. But just do it. Frankly, I would like to see all of these people--the committees have passed on them. The committees have given them, in most cases, unanimous recommendations and some overwhelming recommendations. 
Let the Senate work its will. I think it is wrong to hold them up but especially in the courts. The courts now face an enormous problem. People are declining appointments to the Federal judiciary because they say they are not going to sit around for 2 or 3 years while their law practices fall apart waiting for the Senate to do what we are paid to do. 
We have, as I said earlier, in the second circuit, my own circuit, a judicial emergency, the first time ever, and yet we have two second circuit court of appeals judges voted out of the committee sitting on the calendar and cannot be voted upon. It is wrong, Mr. President, for the Senate to try to diminish the Federal bench. 
One of the most important parts of our democracy is the fact that we have an independent judiciary. No other nation on Earth has the ability to appoint to a judiciary, handling as complex and varied items as ours does, and still retain its independence. Some, I am afraid to say, on the other side of the aisle and in the other body feel that we must start intimidating these judges--their words, that we must start holding up these judges--their words. 
That is wrong. This democracy is maintained and is able to remain a democracy, even though it is the most powerful nation on Earth, because of an independent judiciary. We hurt all Americans. We hurt the criminal justice system; we allow people to escape for their misdeeds if we do not have the judges there to try the cases. And if you are a private litigant, you cannot be heard. Even though you pay the taxes, you pay the bills, you cannot be heard because the judges are not there. 
I see the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona in the Chamber. I know he is seeking recognition. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Ashcroft, and others, in introducing today the `Encryption Protects the Rights of Individuals from Violation and Abuse in Cyberspace,' or E-PRIVACY Act, to reform our nation's cryptography policy in a constructive and positive manner. It is time the Administration woke up to the critical need for a common sense encryption policy in this country. 
I have been sounding the alarm bells about this issue for several years now, and have introduced encryption legislation, with bipartisan support, in the last Congress and again in this one, to balance the important privacy, economic, national security and law enforcement interests at stake. The volume of those alarm bells should be raised to emergency sirens. 
Hardly a month goes by without press reports of serious breaches of computer security that threaten our critical infrastructures, including Defense Department computer systems, the telephone network, or computer systems for airport control towers. The lesson of these computer breaches--often committed by computer savvy teenagers--is that all the physical barriers we might put in place can be circumvented using the wires that run into every building to support the computers and computer networks that are the mainstay of how we do business. A well-focused cyber-attack on the computer networks that support telecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking, electrical power and other critical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on our national economy or even jeopardize our national defense or public safety. 
We have been aware of the vulnerabilities of our computer networks for some time. It became clear to me almost a decade ago, during hearings I chaired of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law on the risks of high-tech terrorism, that merely `hardening' our physical space from potential attack is not enough. We must also `harden' our critical infrastructures to ensure our security and our safety. 
That is where encryption technology comes in. Encryption can protect the security of our computer information and networks. Indeed, both former Senator Sam Nunn and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who serve as co-chairs of the Advisory Committee to the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, have testified that `encryption is essential for infrastructure protection.' 
Yet U.S. encryption policy has acted as a deterrent to better security. As long ago as 1988, at the High-Tech Terrorism hearings I chaired, Jim Woolsey, who later became the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, testified about the need to do a better job of using encryption to protect our computer networks. Of particular concern is the recent testimony of former Senator Sam Nunn that the `continuing federal government-private sector deadlock over encryption and export policies' may pose an obstacle to the cooperation needed to protect our country's critical infrastructures. 
I have long advocated the use of strong encryption by individuals, government agencies and private companies to protect their valuable and confidential computer information. Moreover, as more Americans every year use the Internet and other computer networks to obtain critical medical services, and conduct their personal and business affairs, maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computer communications both here and abroad has only grown in importance. As an avid computer user and Internet surfer myself, I care deeply about protecting individual privacy and encouraging the development of the Internet as a secure and trusted communications medium. 
Encryption is the key to protecting the privacy of our online communications and electronic records by ensuring that only the people we choose can read those communications and records. That is why the primary thrust of the encryption legislation I have introduced is to encourage--and not stand in the way of--the widespread use of strong encryption. 
Strong encryption serves as a crime prevention shield to stop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into private computer files and stealing valuable proprietary information. Unfortunately, we still have a long away to go to reform our country's encryption policy to reflect that this technology is a significant crime and terrorism prevention tool. 
Even as our law enforcement and intelligence agencies try to slow down the widespread use of strong encryption, technology continues to move forward. Ironically, foot-dragging by the Administration on export controls is driving encryption technology, expertise and manufacturing overseas where we will lose even more control over its proliferation. 
Indeed, due to the sorry state of our export controls on encryption, we are seeing rising numbers of our high-tech companies turning to overseas firms as suppliers of the strong encryption demanded by their customers. For example, Network Associates recently announced that it will make strong encryption software developed in the United States available through a Swiss company. Other companies, including Sun Microsystems, are cooperating with foreign firms to manufacture and distribute overseas strong encryption software originally developed here at home. 
Encryption technology, invented with American ingenuity, will now be manufactured and distributed in Europe, and imported back into this country. 
Driving encryption expertise overseas is extremely short-sighted and poses a real threat to our national security. Driving high-tech jobs overseas is a threat to our economic security, and stifling the widespread, integrated use of strong encryption is a threat to our public safety. The E-PRIVACY Act would reverse the incentives for American companies to look abroad for strong encryption by relaxing our export controls. 
Specifically, the bill would grant export license exceptions, after a one-time technical review, for mass market products with encryption capabilities, products which do not themselves provide encryption but are capable of interoperating with encryption products, and customized hardware and software with encryption capabilities so long as foreign products with comparable encryption are available. 
At the same time, the bill retains important restrictions on encryption exports for military end-uses or to terrorist-designated or embargoed countries, such as Cuba and North Korea. It also affirms the continued authority of the Secretary of Commerce over encryption exports and assures that before export, the Secretary is able to conduct a one-time technical review of all encryption products to ensure that the product works as represented. 
The E-PRIVACY Act puts to rest the specter of domestic controls on encryption. This legislation bars government-mandated key recovery (or key escrow encryption) and ensures that all computer users are free to choose any encryption method to protect the privacy of their online communications and computer files. 
At the heart of the encryption debate is the power this technology gives computer users to choose who may access their communications and stored records, to the exclusion of all others. For the same reason that encryption is a powerful privacy enhancing tool, it also poses challenges for law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies want access even when we do not choose to give it. We are mindful of these national security and law enforcement concerns that have dictated the Administration's policy choices on encryption. 
With the appropriate procedural safeguards in place, law enforcement agencies should be able to get access to decryption assistance. The E-PRIVACY Act contains a number of provisions designed to address these concerns, including a new criminal offense for willful use of encryption to hide incriminating evidence from law enforcement detection, establishment of a NET Center to help federal, state and local law enforcement stay abreast of advanced technologies, and explicit procedures for law enforcement to obtain decryption assistance from third parties for encrypted communications or records to which law enforcement has lawful access. 
One of the starkest deficiencies in the Administration's key recovery proposals has always been the question of foreign government access. The Administration has sought reciprocal relationships with foreign governments as a critical part of an effective global key recovery system. Yet many Americans and American companies are rightfully concerned about the terms under which foreign governments would get access to decryption assistance. The E-PRIVACY Act makes clear what those terms will be and ensures that foreign governments will not get access to private decryption keys, but only, at most, plaintext. 
This is not just an important issue for the privacy and security of Americans; it also is a significant human rights issue. Today, human rights organizations worldwide are using encryption to protect their work and the lives of investigators, witnesses and victims overseas. Amnesty International uses it. Human Rights Watch uses it. The human rights program in the American Association for the Advancement of Science uses it. It is used to protect witnesses 
who report human rights abuses in the Balkans, in Burma, in Guatemala, in Tibet. I have been told about a number of other instances in which strong encryption has been used to further the causes of democracy and human rights. 
For example, in the ongoing trial of Argentinean military officers in Spain, on charges of genocide and terrorism arising out of the `dirty war,' the human rights group Derechos uses the encryption program Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)--which the United States government tried to keep out of the hands of foreigners--to encrypt particularly confidential messages that go between Spain and Argentina, to stop the Argentinean intelligence forces from being able to read them and so try to jeopardize the trial. 
A group in Guatemala is using a computer database to track the names of witnesses to military massacres. A South African organization keeps the names of applicants for amnesty for political crimes carried out in South Africa during the apartheid regime. Workers at both groups could be subject to intimidation, harassment, or murder by those intent on preventing the public discussion and analysis of the claims. Both systems are protected by strong cryptography. 
A not-for-profit agency working for human rights in the Balkans uses PGP to protect all sensitive files. Its offices have been raided by various police forces looking for evidence of `subversive activities.' Last year in Zagreb, security police raided its office and confiscated its computers in the hope of retrieving information about the identity of people who had complained about human rights abuses by the authorities. PGP allowed the group to communicate and protect its files from any attempt to gain access. The director of the organization spent 13 days in prison for not opening his encrypted files but has said `it was a very small price to pay for protecting our clients.' 
The Iraqi National Congress, a group opposing Saddam Hussein with offices in London and supporters inside Iraq, uses encrypted e-mail to communicate with its supporters inside Iraq. (Non-governmental Internet connections are banned in Iraq, but the dissidents within Iraq access e-mail by dialing outside the country with satellite telephones). 
Burmese human rights activists working in the relative safe haven of Thailand use encryption when communicating on-line, because the Thai government maintains diplomatic relations with the Burmese government and is expected to turn over information to the Burmese authorities. 
The FBI has argued that lives may be lost in sensitive terrorist and other investigations if government agencies do not have access to private encryption keys. However, the reverse is equally true: weak encryption or easy government access to decryption assistance could jeopardize lives as well. 
Finally, the E-PRIVACY Act contains provisions to enhance the privacy protections for communications, even when encryption is not employed. Specifically, the bill would require law enforcement to obtain a court order based on probable cause before using a cellular telephone as a tracking device. In addition, the bill would require law enforcement agencies to obtain a court order or provide notice when seizing electronic records that a person stores on a computer network rather than on the hard drive of his or her own personal computer. Finally, the bill grants Federal judges authority to evaluate the reasons proffered by a prosecutor for issuance of an ex parte pen register or trap and trace device order, by contrast to their mere ministerial authority under current law. 
In sum, the E-PRIVACY Act accomplishes the eight goals that Senator Ashcroft and I set out during our April 2, 1998, colloquy on the floor. Specifically, we sought to craft legislation that promotes the following principles: 
First, ensure the right of Americans to choose how to protect the privacy and security of their communications and information; 
Second, bar a government-mandated key escrow encryption system; 
Third, establish both procedures and standards for access by law enforcement to decryption keys or decryption assistance for both encrypted communications and stored electronic information and only permit such access upon court order authorization, with appropriate notice and other procedural safeguards; 
Fourth, establish both procedures and standards for access by foreign governments and foreign law enforcement agencies to the plaintext of encrypted communications and stored electronic information of United States persons; 
Fifth, modify the current export regime for encryption to promote the global competitiveness of American companies; 
Sixth, avoid linking the use of certificate authorities with key recovery agents or, in other words, not link the use of encryption for confidentiality purposes with use of encryption for authenticity and integrity purposes; 
Seventh, consistent with these goals of promoting privacy and the global competitiveness of our high-tech industries, help our law enforcement agencies and national security agencies deal with the challenges posed by the use of encryption; and 
Eighth, protect the security and privacy of information provided by Americans to the government by ensuring that encryption products used by the government interoperate with commercial encryption products. 
Resolving the encryption debate is critical for our economy, our national security and our privacy. This is not a partisan issue. This is not a black-and-white issue of being either for law enforcement and national security or for Internet freedom. Characterizing the debate in these simplistic terms is neither productive nor accurate. 
Delays in resolving the encryption debate hurt most the very public safety and national security interests that are posed as obstacles to resolving this issue. We need sensible solutions in legislation that will not be subject to change at the whim of agency bureaucrats. 
Every American, not just those in the software and high-tech industries and not just those in law enforcement agencies, has a stake in the outcome of this debate. We have a legislative stalemate right now that needs to be resolved, and I hope to work closely with my colleagues and the Administration on a solution.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many of the times I have spoken about Vermont, I have talked about the fact that in small cities and towns everybody knows everybody else. We are a State of neighbors, from the stores on the corner to the places of worship and our town squares. 
Recently, the Burlington Free Press wrote an article about John Adams. He has spent 40 years fitting shoes and boots and footwear for the people of Burlington, VT, and its surrounding areas. 
When they were writing this article, it brought back to my wife and myself the memories of going into that same store with John Adams with our young children, lining them up, getting their shoes. Those children are all grown now. And John Adams is still there. He is still one of the reasons why I love my home in Burlington and why Vermont always has been and always will be home.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for their outstanding work on legislation to reform the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is time for the IRS to deliver better service to the American people. Our nation's taxpayers deserve no less. 
Today, Senator Ashcroft and I are offering an amendment to H.R. 2676 based on the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act of 1998, S. 1901. Our bipartisan legislation requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with speedy access to tax forms, publications and other published guidance via the Internet. 
Mr. President, I want to praise the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley for their leadership in moving the IRS reform legislation to the full Senate. I strongly support the bill approved by the Finance Committee. 
As the Senate prepares to debate IRS reforms, we must use technology to make the IRS more effective for all taxpayers. What better way to do that then to require the IRS to maintain online access to the latest tax information. Every citizen in the United States, no matter if he or she lives in a small town or big city, should be able to receive electronically the latest published tax guidance or download the most up-to-date tax form. 
The IRS web page at >http://irs.ustreas.gov< provides timely service to taxpayers by increasing electronic access to some tax forms and publications. I commend the IRS for its use of Internet technology to improve its services. More information and services should be offered online and not just as a passing fad. Our legislation is needed to build on this electronic start and lock into the law for today and tomorrow comprehensive online taxpayer services. 
For Tax Forms, Instructions and Publications, our legislation provides for online posting of documents created during the most recent five years, the same period of time that the IRS now keeps these documents on CD-ROM for Congressional offices. With these common sense requirements, the IRS will be able to enhance its web page with comprehensive tax guidance in a matter of days at little cost to taxpayers under our bipartisan bill. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has scored our legislation as adding no new direct spending. 
Thomas Jefferson observed that, `Information is the currency of democracy.' Let's harness the power of the information age to make the IRS a truly democratic institution, open to all our citizens all the time. We strongly believe that the IRS must prepare itself for the next millennium now. 
I thank Senator Ashcroft for his support and urge my colleagues to support our amendment.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I strongly support the amendment offered by my friend from Missouri and commend the Senator from Missouri for what he has just said. 
I am proud to cosponsor this effort. It strikes the one sentence in this IRS reform bill that I believe takes away the rights of a taxpayer. I know that is not the intent of the sponsors of this legislation. They have done a very good job trying to reform the IRS. I think we can correct this error. 
The bill as currently written would create a rebuttable presumption by the Internal Revenue Service that any tax return which has been signed by electronic or digital means has actually been submitted by the person associated with the virtual signature. That is a rebuttable assumption that is unnecessary. It is adverse to the taxpayers' interests. But worse, it is likely to deter taxpayers from accepting all-electronic tax filing. 
More and more things are being done online, more and more things are being done electronically, and more and more taxpayers are getting used to doing a lot of their commercial transactions electronically. And they should be able to do the same with the one thing that every one of us has to do at least once a year, and that is file a tax return. We may or may not order from an electronic catalog, we may or may not buy things over the Internet, but sometime during the year we have to pay our taxes. If we are used to using things electronically, we should be able to file our tax return electronically. 
But unless the sentence we are talking about is removed from this bill, a taxpayer filing an all-electronic tax document will face a greater evidentiary burden in any subsequent dispute with the IRS than a taxpayer who signed a paper return with pen and ink. An electronic signature should have no less and no greater status in the tax context than a physical signature. 
The presumption would provide unintended assistance to perpetrators of tax frauds, forgeries, and electronic identity thefts such as the `innocent spouse' cases recently reviewed by the Finance Committee. It could even reverse the presumption of innocence and due process of taxpayers in criminal prosecutions by the IRS. None of us want to do that. 
We have laws regarding authentication of electronic and digital signatures, but they are in their infancy. Several States, including my home State of Vermont, are crafting legislation to promote secure and reliable digital signatures. Senator Ashcroft and I, by working together to craft bipartisan Federal legislation on digital signatures, are trying to do precisely that. Congress should not be giving the Internal Revenue Service unrestricted authority in this emerging area of cyberspace law. 
If you adopt the Ashcroft-Leahy amendment, then, if you have an electronically authenticated tax document, it will still be treated under the bill, for all civil and criminal purposes, the same as a paper return. That principle of equality is the correct standard. Citizens should not be required to forfeit rights to use new technology. 
If somebody is used to using the Internet, if they are used to using their computers in electronic commerce, they should not suddenly have a roadblock go up to say, `But not on your tax 
returns. You have to go the old-fashioned way.' If people are going into the computer and digital age, they ought to be able to do that for their tax returns, too. 
I commend what Senator Roth, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Kerrey and Senator Moynihan and Senator Grassley have done here to bring us into the electronic age and to bring us to a more modern system with the IRS. What the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, and I are trying to do is to make sure we go even further into the modern age. Our amendment is supported by such diverse groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Americans for Tax Reform. 
So I hope my colleagues will support the Ashcroft-Leahy-Burns amendment. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which the Senate Judiciary Committee is reporting today, is important for our economy, for our creative industries and for the future of the Internet. This legislation is based on the WIPO implementing legislation, S. 1121, recommended by the Administration and introduced last year by the Chairman, Senators Thompson and Kohl and me. 
Following intensive discussions with a number of interested parties, including libraries, universities, small businesses, online and Internet service providers, telephone companies, computer users, broadcasters, content providers and device manufacturers, the Committee was able to reach unanimous agreement on certain modifications and additions incorporated into the bill and making this bill a product of which we can all be proud. 
Significant provisions were added to the bill in Title II to clarify the liability for copyright infringement of online and Internet service providers. These provisions set forth `safe harbors' from liability for ISPs and OSPs under clearly defined circumstances, which both encourage responsible behavior and protect important intellectual property rights. In addition, during the Committee's consideration of this bill, an Ashcroft-Leahy-Hatch amendment was adopted to ensure that computer users are given reasonable notice of when their Web sites are the subject of infringement complaints, and to provide procedures for computer users to have material mistakenly taken down put back. 
This bill contains a number of provisions designed to help libraries and archives. First, libraries expressed concerns about the possibility of criminal sanctions or potentially ruinous monetary liability for actions taken in good faith. This bill makes sure that libraries acting in good faith can never be subject to fines or civil damages. Specifically, a library is exempt from monetary liability in a civil suit if it was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a violation. In addition, libraries are completely exempt from the criminal provisions. 
Second, the bill contains a browsing exception for libraries. Libraries have indicated that in an online environment dominated by encrypted works it may be impossible for them to gain access to works to decide whether or not to acquire them. The current version of the bill permits libraries to circumvent access prevention technologies in order to make a good faith determination of whether or not it would like to buy a copy of a work. If the library decides that it wishes to acquire the work it must negotiate with the copyright owner just as libraries do today. 
Third, the Chairman, Senator Ashcroft and I crafted an amendment to provide for the preservation of digital works by qualified libraries and archives. The ability of Libraries to preserve legible copies of works in digital form is one I consider critical. Under present law, libraries are permitted to make a single facsimile copy of works in their collections for preservation purposes, or to replace lost, damaged or stolen copies of works that have become commercially unavailable. This law, however, has become outmoded by changing technology and preservation practices. The bill ensures that libraries' collections will continue to be available to future generations by permitting libraries to make up to three copies in any format--including in digital form. This was one of the proposals in the National Information Infrastructure Copyright Protection Act of 1995, which I sponsored in the last Congress. The Register of Copyrights, among others, has supported that proposal. 
In addition, the bill would permit a library to transfer a work from one digital format to another if the equipment needed to read the earlier format becomes unavailable commercially. This change addresses a problem that should be familiar to anyone whose office has boxes of eight-inch floppy disks tucked away somewhere. 
These provisions go a long way toward meeting the concerns that libraries have expressed about the original bill, S. 1121, introduced to implement the WIPO treaties. 
Another issue that the bill addresses is distance learning. When Congress enacted the present copyright law it recognized the potential of broadcast and cable technology to supplement classroom teaching, and to bring the classroom to those who, because of their disabilities or other special circumstances, are unable to attend classes. At the same time, Congress also recognized the potential for unauthorized transmissions of works to harm the markets for educational uses of copyrighted materials. In the present Copyright Act, we struck a careful balance and crafted a narrow exemption. But as with so many areas of copyright law, the advent of digital technology requires us to take another look at the issue. 
I recognize that the issue of distance learning has been under consideration for the past several years by the Conference on Fair Use (CONFU) that was established by the Administration to consider issues relating to fair use in the digital environment. In spite of the hard work of the participants, CONFU has so far been unable to forge a comprehensive agreement on guidelines for the application of fair use to digital distance learning. The 
issue is an important one, and I commend Senator Ashcroft for his attention to this matter. 
We made tremendous strides in charting the appropriate course for updating the Copyright Act to permit the use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. The Chairman, Senator Ashcroft and I joined together to ask the Copyright Office to facilitate discussions among interested library and educational groups and content providers with a view toward making recommendations that could be incorporated into the DMCA at the April 30 mark up. The Copyright Office did just that, once again providing a valuable service to this Committee. 
Based on the Copyright Office's recommendations, we incorporated into the DMCA a new Section 122 requiring the Copyright Office to make broader recommendations to Congress on digital distance education within six months. Upon receiving the Copyright Office's recommendations, it is my hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will promptly commence hearings on the issue and move expeditiously to enact further legislation on the matter. I know that my fellow members on this Committee are as anxious as I am to complete the process that we started in Committee of updating the Copyright Act to permit the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. This step should be viewed as a beginning--not an end, and we are committed to reaching that end point as quickly as possible. 
Senator Feinstein had sought to clarify when a university would be held responsible for the actions of its employees in connection with its eligibility for the safe harbors spelled out in title II of the bill. Chairman Hatch, Senator Ashcroft and I agreed with Senator Feinstein that the best way to address this issue is to have the Copyright Office examine this issue in a comprehensive fashion, because of its importance, complexity, and implications for other online service providers, including libraries and archives. 
Amendments sponsored by Senators Ashcroft, Hatch and I were also crafted to address the issues of reverse engineering, ephemeral recordings and to clarify for broadcasters the use of copyright management information in the course of certain analog and digital transmissions. 
Legislative language was incorporated into the bill to clarify that the law enforcement exemptions apply to all government agencies which conduct law enforcement and intelligence work, as well as to government contractors engaging in intelligence, investigative, or protective work. 
Chairman Hatch, Senator Ashcroft and I agreed to language to assuage the concerns of the consumer electronics manufacturers, and others, that the bill might require them to design their products to respond to any particular technological protection measure. We also agreed to incorporate provisions into the bill clarifying that nothing in the bill will prevent parents from controlling their children's access to the Internet or individuals from protecting personal identifying information. 
By reaching agreement on this bill, this Committee is helping to create American jobs, protect American ingenuity, and foster an ever more vibrant Internet. In short, the WIPO treaties and this implementing legislation are important to America's economic future. The bill addresses the problems caused when copyrighted works are disseminated through the Internet and other electronic transmissions without the authority of the copyright owner. By establishing clear rules of the road, this bill will allow electronic commerce to flourish in a way that does not undermine America's copyright community. 
In a recent letter about the DMCA, Secretary Daley said, `The United States must lead the way in setting a standard that will protect our creative industries and serve as a model for the rest of the world. And we need to act as quickly as possible.' 
This bill is a well-balanced package of proposals that address the needs of creators, consumers and commerce well into the next century. I urge all of my colleagues to support the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and work for its prompt passage.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 30th the people of Israel celebrated their nation's fiftieth anniversary and people around the world commemorated the realization of a dream of a Jewish state first envisioned by Theodor Herzl in 1897. Today, with characteristic courage, intelligence and determination, Israelis face the many challenges that lie ahead. 
With the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the ethnic violence that has rocked parts of Europe and Africa, the term `nation building' has taken on new significance as we near the end of the millennium. National borders that were static during the Cold War have changed and in some countries the institutions necessary for a functioning government have crumbled. We need only look as far as Israel to realize what can be accomplished with a vision and the will to fulfill it. 
In 1948, 600,000 Jews emerged from the Holocaust to forge a nation committed to the ideals of democracy and the prosperity of its people. Having survived the genocide that has since been burned into the world's collective memory, the founders of the Jewish state embarked on a mission to unite a people speaking over 100 languages and dispersed for 2,000 years in 140 countries. At the time it seemed like an impossible challenge, yet today it is a reality that represents one of the greatest, most breathtaking accomplishments of this century. 
The founders of Israel did not recognize the obstacles before them as limitations but as opportunities. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion used to say that a man who does not believe in miracles is not a realistic person. Yet, not even he imagined what could be accomplished in just 50 years. 
Despite the toll taken by six wars and innumerable terrorist attacks, despite the difficulties inherent in resurrecting an ancient language and absorbing 2.6 million immigrants, the people of Israel have created a nation at the forefront of technology, industry, art and academics. They have created a nation that embodies democratic principles and practices. They have served as a staunch ally of the United States in the most dangerous region of the world. 
On May 15, 1948, when President Truman first declared our nation's support for the free state of Israel, I was eight years old. On that day my father sat me down and, with great emotion, told me what a historic event it was, how important it was to Jews around the world who were struggling to rebuild their lives, reaffirm their identity and heal their communities after years of suffering. His words rang true and they left a lasting impression. 
Since then I have traveled to Israel many times. I have had the privilege to know as friends former Prime Ministers Rabin and Perez, two extraordinary courageous leaders. I have seen how the Jewish people have never shied away from adversity, but have faced it fearlessly and with a commitment to overcome. But despite all they have accomplished, much work remains. Many of us will not be here to mark Israel's 100th anniversary. I fervently hope, however, that those who are here to celebrate will be able to recount to their own children and their grandchildren the events that led to a lasting peace for all the citizens of this small but powerful nation. 
Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the people of Israel and reaffirm the bond that President Truman first established in 1948.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about Jules and Helen Rabin who are long-time, respected Vermonters. Marcelle and I are proud to call them our friends. The Rabins exhibit what so many Vermonters have: a sense of what is valuable and important in life. With hard work, dedication, and a great deal of patience, Jules and Helen have built up a successful family bakery, serving the needs of their community. Over the last 20 years they have become masters of their craft. Recently, one of our local newspapers wrote an excellent article about the Rabins and their bakery. I ask that the article be printed in the Record so that all Senators may read about this fine family. 
The article follows. 
From the Rutland Herald and the Sunday Times Argus, Mar. 8, 1998  
In Search of Sourdough--A Vermont Baker Sets Out to Find--and Make--the Perfect Loaf  
When you bite into sourdough bread, your teeth meet with a worthy substance: Crackling hard crust, the bread inside chewy almost to the point of toughness, a sour tang. And once you've chewed and swallowed a few times, a satisfaction that few other breads deliver. 
Real bread, for my money or effort, must meet this test. And it must proudly withstand toasting and slathering with sweet butter, not in the least smashed, or lessened in its big-holed texture. It should produce a clean crunch when bitten, and when chewed, remain substantial food, not melting into a gooey mash. 
Overall, bread must take effort to cut, and time to chew and digest. It must, truly, be the `staff of life.' 
But buying good sourdough bread can eat up the grocery budget; the loaves typically cost more than $3 each. Besides, I find baking bread to be an almost spiritual experience. And eating fine bread that you made yourself, listening to friends' compliments, is gratifying. 
I've baked bread since my teen years. Some of what I make is outstanding. Some loaves I give to the sheep. 
Lately, I've returned to baking sourdough. Sourdough, made with only the wild yeasts that choose to set up home in a culture of water and flour you provide, is wild, unruly bread, its flavor distinctive to the region where it is made. You don't know how the bread dough will behave from baking to baking, since the leavening agent--the sourdough--is very sensitive to atmospheric conditions and room temperature. From my experience, I'd say the baker's temperament is included under `atmospheric conditions' and can greatly influence the outcome. 
I've made attempts at sourdough breads before, keeping a liquid starter in the refrigerator for months. I'd use it for a while, then forget about it and later find a dried-up mass that I'd have to throw out, jar and all. But the loaves I made from those starters never compared to the bread I found at the local food coop.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the L's come before the M's. I will be very happy to withhold my vote when it comes time, if that helps to get the Senator from Maryland in that sequence. 
Mr. President, the vote on the resolution to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO, as we have all said, is as important as any we have cast in many years. 
The debate on this resolution has been gaining momentum for over the year. The issues have been discussed, not always in the depth or with the clarity that I would have liked, but I am not among those who feel that we have not had an opportunity to seriously consider this resolution. I only wish that we had had this week's debate a year ago, when the outcome of the vote was not a fait accompli. 
I deeply respect many of the people on both sides of the issue. None more than Secretary of State Albright, an ardent proponent of NATO enlargement, with whom I spoke by telephone yesterday while she was in China. I yield to no member of this body in my admiration of her. 
I also give great weight to the views of the former Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, and to my close friend Senator Moynihan, whose thoughtful speeches on the subject I have read with keen interest. I have also appreciated the views of a number of Vermonters who have expertise in arms control and U.S.-Russian relations. There have been well-qualified and articulate Vermonters on both sides of the debate. 
But despite that, I am no more convinced by the positions of either side than I was when the debate began. After everything that has been spoken and written, I remain profoundly troubled by this resolution, as I know many others are. It is not more debate that is needed, it is the ability to predict the future, which of course none of us can. 
It is because the future is so unpredictable, and I am still not convinced on an issue of such historic importance, that I will vote against this resolution. 
Mr. President, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been the world's most powerful and successful military alliance. For half a century, NATO served as a deterrent to a Soviet invasion of Europe. It has helped to keep the peace in a region that has seen countless wars over the centuries, including two world wars in this century. When genocide erupted in Bosnia it was NATO, with, I might add, the help of Russian soldiers, that enforced the Dayton peace accords. The earlier failure of the United Nations in Bosnia is but one example of NATO's relevance today. 
So I am not among those who believes that because the cold war is over NATO is no longer needed. Bosnia proved otherwise, and there are other threats to which NATO might be called upon to respond. One, although no one likes to contemplate it, is a Russia in which the democratic reformers are ousted by nationalists whose attitude is overtly hostile and aggressive toward the West. I do not see that happening, but it is possible. 
Russia is in the midst of far-reaching changes. Much of what is happening there is encouraging, even remarkable. The old Soviet Union is gone forever, of that I have no doubt. But democracy remains extremely fragile, and some of what is happening in Russia is discouraging, even alarming. 
Some things in Russia have not changed. It continues to possess thousands of nuclear weapons, and while we and the Russians are cooperating on a wide range of issues including arms control, no one knows what Russia will look like ten years 
or even ten months from now. More than anything else, to vote for this resolution one should feel confident that enlarging NATO will lead to a closer and more cooperative relationship between Russia and the West. There is no more important issue for the security of Europe and the United States. 
Reaching the decision to oppose this resolution was extremely difficult. Over the past couple of months as the vote approached I have seen that, as in many debates, the issues are far from black and white. I finally settled on four questions. I decided that only if I could confidently answer each of them in the affirmative could I vote for what amounts to a fundamental reshaping of NATO. I discussed these questions with other Senators, with the Secretary of State, and with many others whose judgment and opinions I respect. 
I asked myself whether admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO result in a more united and secure Europe? 
Would it result in a stronger, more effective NATO? 
Would it improve our relations with Russia, especially Russia's willingness to vigorously pursue deep reductions in nuclear weapons? 
And would it result in benefits that justify substantial additional military costs to the United States and the new NATO members? 
These are not novel questions. Any one of them could occupy hours or even days of debate. They have been discussed at length by members of this body, and by some of our most knowledgeable European and Russian scholars and analysts including former Secretaries of State and Defense. What has struck me as I have read and listened to their views is the certainty and conviction with which they express them. Perhaps that is the nature of advocacy, but I find it interesting nonetheless because their conclusions, on a subject of such immense importance to our future security, are based on so much that is uncertain, indeed unknowable. 
Mr. President, I began from the perspective that the presumption is against expanding NATO at this time. A rebutable presumption, but NATO has served us well for over fifty years and we should be wary of any attempt to substantially alter its configuration. 
That is not to say that NATO can or should remain static. Its mission does need to evolve with the changing times. But what is contemplated here, by voting to admit these three invitees and opening the door to further admissions in the future, amounts to a fundamental reshaping of NATO. Before we take that step I want to be convinced that the benefits of enlargement justify the risks and the cost. 
Would enlargement result in a more united and secure Europe? More united, probably yes. But what if expansion does not extend to the republics of the former Soviet Union, or even to certain other Eastern European countries. Then we have simply created a new dividing line in Europe, and new rivalries between those inside NATO and those that are excluded. 
Would enlargement result in a stronger, more effective NATO? Frankly, I have been disappointed with the direction and focus of NATO in recent years. At times I have felt it was adrift, and at no time more than when NATO sat on the sidelines as the United Nations floundered in Bosnia. NATO has redeemed itself there but not until many thousands of innocent people had died, including in so- 
called UN safe-havens. NATO should have acted sooner and with far more decisiveness. 
The administration says that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic accept the responsibilities of NATO membership and will contribute an additional 300,000 troops. Others argue that by adding new members we dilute NATO's effectiveness with poorly equipped, Soviet-trained forces. As Ambassador Paul Nitze has said, NATO would become `fat and feeble.' 
My own guess, and it is only a guess, is that NATO would probably not suffer, it might benefit from admitting these three invitees, but if additional countries are admitted next year or thereafter as most proponents of expansion anticipate, it would become unwieldy, even less decisive, and weakened. 
My third question, and perhaps the most important, is whether enlargement would improve our relations with Russia, especially Russia's willingness to vigorously pursue deep reductions in nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President, the administration asserts that NATO expansion will lead to improved relations between the West and Russia because it will result in a more stable and secure Europe, a more prosperous Europe, and a new relationship between Russia and the former Warsaw countries that is based on partnership. 
I do not see the evidence to support such a rosy picture. But whether or not it is true, is a military alliance the best or only way to achieve that new relationship? I do not see why. The enlargement of NATO, no matter how benign, can only strengthen the hand of left and right-wing extremists in Russia, while undermining the position of the democrats we support. 
On arms control, the administration offers a litany of examples of how Russia is continuing to engage and cooperate on a broad agenda of security issues. There is cooperation, most visibly in Bosnia where Russian and American soldiers are enforcing the Dayton accords side-by-side. There is talk of the Duma ratifying START II in the near future. There are other examples. 
But it seems to me that the real question is how can we best take advantage--not of Russia's weakness--but of the opportunity for a fundamentally different relationship, an opportunity that comes rarely in history, and which is fortuitously presented by the transitional stage in which Russia finds itself today. 
In World War I, Europe isolated and alienated a defeated Germany, and in so doing sowed the seeds for World War II. After that war, through the leadership of great Americans like General Marshall and President Truman, we embraced our former German enemies and in so doing fostered one of the world's strongest democracies. It would be unforgivable to repeat a mistake of such tragic proportions. 
Do we build a closer relationship with Russia by enlarging a military alliance possibly to its very borders, an alliance that has served principally to deter Soviet aggression? The so-called `iron belt,' as Senator Warner has aptly called it? If Russia posed a serious military threat today I would see things differently. But the only serious military threat Russia poses is its arsenal of nuclear missiles, and I would argue that that threat is not diminished by expanding NATO eastward. 
There is reason to suspect that NATO enlargement has already delayed DUMA ratification of START II, and that it has set back the cause for arms control in Russia. It has abandoned its `no-first-use' policy and, as its security situation 
deteriorates, Russia is headed toward greater reliance on nuclear weapons. 
My point, Mr. President, is that while relations between Russia and the West are obviously far better than they were during the cold war, they are a far cry from what I believe they can and should be. 
The Russians can be difficult to deal with. I am aware of that. They are obsessed with being treated as equals even though they are no longer a superpower. Russia in many respects is a poor, backward country. As we have seen in the recent spat with Latvia over Russian immigrants, Moscow is prone to reverting to its threatening, Cold War manner of dealing with its former territories. 
But Russia is a big country. Big countries expect to exert a certain amount of power in their sphere of influence, and it will take time for Russia to recognize that those ways of acting are no longer acceptable. 
No one knows who will follow President Yeltsin. Russia's future is too unpredictable for us to disband NATO, and in any event there are other important missions for NATO than to defend against Russian aggression. On that point I fully agree with the administration. I have lived most of my life in a world with NATO. I want future generations to benefit from this unmatched military alliance led by democratic nations. It serves us well. 
But the United States should be doing everything possible to build a non-threatening, cooperative and stable relationship with Russia. Rather than rush to extend an historically anti-Russia alliance and build up the military capabilities of its neighbors --an approach that has undeniably caused great resentment and uneasiness in Russia, we should be building alliances that do not create new divisions between us. 
Mr. President, my fourth question is whether enlargement would result in benefits that justify substantial additional military costs to the United States and the new NATO members. 
One of the most troubling issues in this debate has been the cost projections. Estimates range from several hundred million dollars, which I find impossible to take seriously if these countries are to pull their own weight in NATO, to tens of billions of dollars. The administration's estimates have changed so many times that are virtually devoid of credibility. 
As best I can tell, we only know that we do not know how much the admission of these three countries would cost, but that it would cost a lot and possibly a lot more than the administration says. When was the last time the Pentagon overestimated the cost of anything? I cannot recall a time. 
Nor can I recall a time when we were asked to vote for something when the cost estimates differed so dramatically--from as little as $400 million to as much as $125 billion. That is a difference of over 300 times. 
Nor do we know what it would cost to admit additional members after we cross this threshold. The President has said that `no qualified European democracy is ruled out as a future member.' There are over twenty. That is a potentially huge investment and a bonanza for the arms manufacturers who are not surprisingly among NATO enlargement's greatest champions. 
The last thing we want to encourage is for the newly admitted countries will go on a weapons buying spree when they should be spending their scarce resources on 
economic development and infrastructure. 
What would NATO be with 22 new members? That may sound farfetched, but under the President's scenario it is at least a plausible outcome and one we must consider before we start down the path of enlargement. I am afraid it would be a much weakened alliance, and one that Russia, rightly or wrongly, could quite reasonably regard as a threat. 
And what commitments would we be making to those future members? President Clinton has said that NATO `enlargement requires that we extend to new members our alliance's most solemn security pledge, to treat an attack against one as an attack against all.' That is what the NATO charter says, but it is far from obvious that the American people are ready to accept that commitment. Others speak vaguely of different types of missions. I have strongly supported international peacekeeping, but I am uneasy about the lack of specificity about what we are committing to here. 
Mr. President, I do not doubt that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have every reason to want to be part of NATO. I also recognize that they have made tremendous progress in meeting the criteria set for NATO admission. But we must judge, above all, if enlarging NATO at this time in history is in the best interests of the United States--not Poland, not Hungary, not the Czech Republic, but the United States and NATO itself. 
I have considered this resolution carefully, but I have been unable to satisfy myself that it is either necessary, or in our best interest. George Kennan, a man I admire greatly, called NATO expansion `the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.' I do not know if George Kennan is right. But neither am I confident that he is wrong. I am not prepared to gamble on his being wrong. 
I hope that I am wrong. It appears that two-thirds of the Senate will vote for this resolution. I sincerely hope that the admission of new countries to NATO produces the desirable outcome the administration forecasts. If that happens I will be the first to admit that I was wrong, and to welcome that outcome. 
As I said at the outset of my remarks, this has been a difficult decision for me. I obviously share the administration's goal of a united, secure and prosperous Europe. We all do. But I believe continued progress can be made to achieve that through Partnership for Peace and other means, without the risks and cost involved in enlarging NATO. Nothing, I am convinced, bears more directly on the future security of Europe and the United States than a democratic Russia that does not fear the West. 
That should be our priority, that is what is at stake, and so the Senator from Vermont will oppose this resolution. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to vote for this Supplemental Appropriations Conference Report because it contains important disaster relief funds for Vermont, which was hard hit by ice storms this winter. Vermont's maple syrup makers suffered devastating losses and these funds will help them recover. 
But were it not for that I would vote against this Conference Report, and I want to take a moment to explain why and to express my regret and frustration about what has occurred here. 
As senators will recall, the Senate passed by a vote of 84-16 funding for the International Monetary Fund as part of this Supplemental. That funding was strongly supported by Senator Stevens, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. It had overwhelming bipartisan support. 
It reflected obvious alarm about the economic crisis in Asia, and the fact that a third of all American jobs are tied to exports and a third of those exports go to Asian markets. 
Secretary Rubin made a strong case that the IMF funding is urgently needed to stem further weakening of the Asian economies. 
So the IMF funding was an issue in the Conference Committee, but the House Republican conferees refused to recede to the Senate position. Apparently the House leadership had ordered them not to agree to the IMF funding because of its continuing dispute with the President over the completely unrelated issue of family planning. 
Mr. President, it is outrageous that yet again we have a vitally important foreign policy matter being held hostage by the House in its seemingly endless and futile attempt to make political points over family planning. 
The IMF funding has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with family planning. They are separate issues and should be decided on their merits, not used as political blackmail. 
I mention this, Mr. President, because the American people, many of whose jobs depend on the stability of foreign markets, should understand exactly what is happening here. 
This is not about the IMF, it is about politics. The House Republican leadership is playing games with the lives of American workers. What do they care? They know that whether or not the Asian economies recover or collapse, the House Republican leadership will have a job regardless. They are not the corn farmer in Iowa, or the manufacturer in Delaware. 
Before they will agree to the IMF funding, the House Republican leadership wants the President to sign a law that prohibits US Government support for private organizations that use their own money to petition foreign governments on abortion. It would prohibit those organizations from even speaking on behalf of policies to make abortion safer in countries where it is legal. 
And if the President does not agree, they would cut funding for family planning which prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortions by $44 million. It is the most illogical approach to an issue I have ever seen. 
Mr. President, we are back to tactics of sabotage, of blackmail, of bringing the government to its knees to win political points. Apparently, as far as the House Republican leadership is concerned nothing matters anymore--not democracy, not the legislative process, and certainly not what is in the best interests of the country. 
It is becoming increasingly clear that it is up to the Senate to prevent the Congress from becoming totally irresponsible.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, joined by Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein, and Cleland, I am introducing legislation which will provide state and federal governments with additional tools to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and drug use in prisons. This legislation is intended to complement the Administration's comprehensive 10-year National Drug Control Strategy by providing federal prosecutors with additional means to seize assets linked to illegal criminal and drug activity and prevent drug kingpins and others from engaging in money laundering. In addition, this legislation will allow states to use federal prison grant funds to test and treat drug-addicted inmates and parolees. 
I note that the Speaker of the House today is hosting a Republican rally to proclaim fault with the Administration's comprehensive drug control strategy. Mr. President, the bill that we are introducing today is not the easy rhetoric that some have to offer in this crucial area of public policy. Here is a chance to actually make a difference. I do not find constructive the efforts of the other body's Republican leadership over the past few years to slash assistance for drug enforcement, prevention and treatment programs. Twice, in fact, they tried to cut the extremely effective Safe and Drug-Free Schools funding by 50 percent, just as they significantly reduced support for drug prevention and treatment programs when they assumed leadership of the Congress in 1995. 
Nor do I consider it constructive for Speaker Gingrich, as he did in his February radio address, to fault the Administration while at the same time claiming credit for such Administration strategies as a national youth-oriented anti-drug campaign and added support for community programs and schools. These are key components of the Administration's 1998 National Drug Control Strategy, including the highly effective radio and TV ads now airing in 12 pilot cities. To really make a difference in more than just the headlines, we need to work together to reduce the quantity of drugs coming into this country and the number of drug addicts both in prison and walking our streets.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator DeWine in introducing legislation to authorize comprehensive Department of Justice grants to every state for criminal justice identification, information and communications technologies and systems. I applaud the Senator from Ohio for his leadership. I am also pleased that the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Leader are original cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation. 
I know from my experience in law enforcement in Vermont over the last 30 years that access to quality, accurate information in a timely fashion is of vital importance. As we prepare to enter the 21st Century, we must provide our state and local law enforcement officers with the resources to develop the latest technological tools and communications systems to solve and prevent crime. I believe this bill accomplishes that goal. 
Our bipartisan legislation authorizes $250 million for each of the next five years in grants to states for crime information and identification systems. The Attorney General, through the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is directed to make grants to each state to be used in conjunction with units of local government, and other states, to use information and identification technologies and systems to upgrade criminal history and criminal justice record systems. 
Grants made under our legislation may include programs to establish, develop, update or upgrade-- 
State, centralized, automated criminal history record information systems, including arrest and disposition reporting. 
Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize fingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible with systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index (III). 
Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact. 
Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility determinations. 
Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and communicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, prosecution, and corrections. 
Non-criminal history record information systems relevant to firearms eligibility determinations for availability and accessibility to the NICS. 
Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting of dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI and to promote the compatibility with, and integration of, court systems with other criminal justice information systems. 
Ballistics identification programs that are compatible and integrated with the ballistics programs of the National Integrated Ballistics Network (NIBN). 
Information, identification and communications programs for forensic purposes. 
DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes. 
Sexual offender identification and registration systems. 
Domestic violence offender identification and information systems 
Programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal justice purposes including youth service employees and volunteers and other individuals in positions of trust, if authorized by federal or state law and administered by a government agency. 
Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide statistical and research products including incident-based reporting systems and uniform crime reports. 
Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and programs. 
Multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional communications systems to share routine and emergency information among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 
Let me just give a couple of examples from my home State of Vermont that illustrate how our comprehensive legislation will aid state and local law enforcement agencies across the country. 
The future of law enforcement must focus on working together to harness the power of today's information age to prevent crime and catch criminals. One way to work together is for state and local law enforcement agencies to band together to create efficiencies of scale. For example, together with New Hampshire and Maine, the State of Vermont has pooled its resources together to build a tri-state IAFIS system to identify fingerprints. Our bipartisan legislation would foster these partnerships by allowing groups of States to apply together for grants. 
Another challange for law enforcement agencies across the country is communication difficulties between federal, state and local law enforcement officials. In a recent report, the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice concluded that law enforcement agencies throughout the nation lack adequate communications systems to respond to crimes that cross state and local jurisdictions. 
A 1997 incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border underscored this problem. During a cross border shooting spree that left four people dead including two New Hampshire state troopers, Vermont and New Hampshire officers were forced to park two police cruisers next to one another to coordinate activities between federal, state and local law enforcement officers because the two states' police radios could not communicate with one another. 
The Vermont Department of Public Safety, the Vermont U.S. Attorney's Office and others have reacted to this communications problem by developing the Northern Lights proposal. This project will allow the northern borders States of Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine to integrate their law enforcement communications systems to better coordinate interdiction efforts and share intelligence data seamlessly. 
Our legislation would provide grants for the development of integrated Federal, State and local law enforcement communications systems to foster cutting edge efforts like the Northern Lights project. 
In addition, our bipartisan legislation will help each of our States meet its obligations under national anti-crime initiatives. For instance, the FBI will soon bring online NCIC 2000 and IAFIS which will require states to update their criminal justice systems for the country to benefit. States are also being asked to participate in several other national programs such as sexual offender registries, national domestic violence legislation, Brady Act, and National Child Protection Act. 
Currently, there are no comprehensive programs to support these national crime-fighting systems. Our legislation will fill this void by helping the each State meet its obligations under these Federal laws. 
Our bipartisan legislation provides a helping hand with the heavy hand of a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach. Unfortunately, some in Congress have pushed legislation mandating minute detail changes that States must make in their laws to qualify for Federal funds. Our bill rejects this approach. Instead, we provide the States with Federal support to improve their criminal justice idenfication, information and communication systems without prescriping new Federal mandates. 
Mr. President, we have patterned the administration of the technology grants under our bill after the highly successful DOJ National Criminal History Improvement Program (N-CHIP), which was created by the 1993 Brady Act. 
The Vermont Department of Public Safety has received funds under the N-CHIP program for the past three years and I have been proud to strongly support their efforts. With that Federal assistance, Vermont has been achieved acquiring the automated fingerprint identification system in conjunction with Maine and New Hampshire, upgrading its records repository computer systems, as well as extending their online incident-based reporting system to local jurisdictions throughout Vermont. Our bill builds on the Justice Department's existing infrastructure under the successful N-CHIP program to provide fair and effective grant administration. 
I know that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Reno's leadership, has made it a priority to modernize and automate criminal history records. Our legislation will continue that leadership by providing each State with the necessary resources to continue to make important efforts to bring their criminal justice systems up to date. 
I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan bill to provide each State with the resources to capture the power of emerging information and communications technologies to serve and protect all of our citizens.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in one of the most outrageous, cold-blooded killings I can recall in a region where such despicable acts have been commonplace, Guatemalan Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi was murdered this past Sunday when his assailant crushed his skull with a cement block. 
The way he died is horrifying enough. But what senators should also be aware of is that Bishop Gerardi had just completed an extraordinarily courageous investigation of the thousands of atrocities committed against Guatemala citizens during thirty years of civil war. He undertook his inquiry after it became clear that the Guatemalan Clarification Commission would not seek to identify those responsible for even the worst atrocities. Bishop Gerardi's investigation, not surprisingly, attributed the overwhelming majority of human rights violations to the military and the death squads and paramilitary groups allied with them. 
Mr. President, the United States bears more than a little responsibility for the slaughter in Guatemala that devastated that country in the years after the CIA-backed coup of 1954. Our government trained the Guatemalan armed forces, remained silent when they tortured and killed thousands of innocent people, withheld information about the atrocities, and justified our complicity as the necessary response to a guerrilla insurgency. In fact, during this period of political violence which is apparently not yet over, the principal victims were Guatemala's Mayan population of rural peasants who have been the target of discrimination and injustice for generations. 
According to a statement by the Guatemalan Embassy, the Guatemalan Government `condemns and repudiates' this crime and has opened an investigation. Let us hope that this investigation can withstand the inevitable pressure from the forces who would intimidate anyone who seeks real justice in Guatemala. The Arzu Government deserves considerable credit for bringing the peace negotiations to a successful conclusion. But few weeks pass that I do not receive a report of a political crime in Guatemala, most of which go unsolved. Justice remains elusive for those who need it most. 
How the Guatemalan government handles this investigation will either embolden or deter those who seek to undermine the peace accords, and, as the Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee I can say that as far as I am concerned it will also be important in determining our future assistance relationship with Guatemala.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my wife and I have lived our lives in Vermont. One of the great advantages of that is the wonderful Vermonters we have gotten to know over the years. 
One of our valued Vermonters is Katherine Paterson, who has just won the 1998 Hans Christian Anderson Award for her authorship of children's books. 
Mrs. Paterson has written 27 children's books, and she and her husband, the Reverend John Paterson, live on Cobble Hill in Barre Town, not far from our tree farm in Middlesex, Vermont.

Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. I assure my friend from Delaware, I will not utilize all that time. I yield myself such time as I require within those constraints. 
Mr. President, when the Senate passed its version of the State authorization bill last year, it contained no reference at all to international family planning or the Mexico City policy, which, as we know, restricts U.S. Government funds to private family planning organizations. The reason for that was obvious. Family planning has nothing to do with the State authorization bill. 
This bill is about how many Assistant Secretaries of State there will be, the bureaus, how they are set up, and so on. It is not about running Planned Parenthood. 
The House saw things differently. Unfortunately, a minority in the House saw yet another opportunity to hold hostage important foreign policy legislation, and they did, like funding for the United Nations and the reorganization of the State Department. In doing so, they sought to force the President to embrace a discredited family planning policy he has repeatedly and publicly rejected. 
For some reason, the House seems to think that sending it down to the White House to get a certain veto represents some kind of victory, when all it does is guarantee that we will revisit this issue again and again and again. 
When I came to the Senate, we had members of both parties who tried to represent the United States in the best way possible. They would join in a bipartisan agreement on foreign policy, to act in ways that would make the United States as strong as possible. 
Somehow, in the past few years, we have some who seek to make political points or fill out forms on fundraising letters, or whatever, and they distort the foreign policy of the United States for their own short-term political gain. It is almost as though, with their ego, they feel that whatever their issue is all that matters, and the foreign policy of the United States can be thrown overboard. They are going to make their point, they are going to send out their fundraising letters, they are going to recruit their supporters based on how they might distort the foreign policy of the United States, and they could care less of the consequences. I will give you an example. 
An agreement was reached last year with the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership of the House and the Senate and the President of the United States that we would pay the dues that we owe under law and under treaty and under agreement to the United Nations. It is money we agreed to pay, are legally obligated to pay, and have not paid. 
Then, on the very day that the United States was asking the Security Council of the United Nations to stand solidly with us on the question of sanctions on Iraq, on the very day that the United States was asking a disparate group in the Security Council to agree with us against Saddam Hussein and his refusal to comply with his obligations under the Security Council resolutions, on that same day the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives broke its word--broke its word to the President, broke its word to the United Nations, broke its word to the American people, broke its word to the Congress--and killed the bill to pay our dues to the United Nations. 
And why? Because a handful of people in the House of Representatives wanted to include the so-called Mexico City language that did not have the support of even a majority of the Senate not to mention enough votes to override a veto, and which the President had made unequivocally clear he would veto.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year we have had to say farewell to Aileen Adams as she leaves the post of Director of Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) and returns to California. Three years ago, Aileen was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. During her time in Washington, I worked with Aileen and OVC on a number of matters and came to know Aileen as a dedicated advocate for crime victims. Her vision and dedication have been extraordinary. Aileen will be sincerely missed, although her legacy will benefit victims of crime for years to come. 
Before coming to the Department of Justice, Aileen had served as the legal counsel for the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica Hospital for 10 years. In that position, Aileen demonstrated her leadership and innovation with the creation of Stuart House, an interagency center for sexually-abused children. 
As Director of OVC, Aileen focused on assisting local and state crime victim programs around the country and improving crime victims services in the federal system. Aileen's leadership has helped over two million crime victims across the country and around the globe. In just this past year, OVC has administered over $528 million and supported more than 2,500 victim assistance programs. 
Aileen's dedication has impacted rural areas such as Vermont. She has helped sharpen the focus on rural crime and domestic violence and supported a rural crime initiative which will study and enhance services available to rural crime victims. 
Among the victim assistance programs pioneered by Aileen was the establishment of the National Victim Assistance Academy last year. This Academy provides training on victims' rights and services and draws upon expertise of professionals ranging from law enforcement officers to rape crises counselors. Over 200 victim advocates and professionals have graduated from the Academy and have taken their skills back to their communities, where they continue outreach work for the benefit of victims. 
Under her leadership, a group of international experts joined to draft a manual to implement the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. Among other things, this manual is a step toward ensuring that crime victims are treated fairly and that they are assisted throughout the globe. 
I had the opportunity to work with Aileen and the many dedicated members of her staff on a number of matters over the last few years. In the aftermath of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Aileen and OVC were among those immediately on the scene to provide assistance to the victims. Together we have found ways to extend and expand that victims assistance over time and to enact legislation to allow victims and their families greater opportunity to attend and observe the trials of those charged in connection with that horrendous crime. 
We worked together on the Victims of Terrorism Act that I added to the bill passed by the Senate in June 1995, in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, to improve our law recognizing the rights and needs of victims of crime. We also worked on the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that was enacted in April 1996. We were able to make funds available through supplemental grants to the States to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and mass violence, which incidents might otherwise have overwhelmed the resources of Oklahoma's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance services. We also filled a gap in our law for residents of the United States who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur outside the borders of the United States. 
In addition, we allowed greater flexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and some greater certainty so that they can know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax and wane with events. Accordingly, we enacted an important provision to increase the base amounts for States' victims assistance grants to $500,000 and allowed victims assistance grants to be made for a 3-year cycle of programming, rather than the year of award plus one, which was the limit contained in previous law. We were able to raise the assessments on those convicted of federal crimes in order to fund the needs of crime victims. 
We worked to improve the church burning legislation and to increase the stability to victim assistance and victim compensation program funds. 
Aileen was helpful in consulting with me and other Senators on the Judiciary Committee on the victims provisions of S. 15, a youth crime bill, so that the rights of victims of juvenile crime to appear, to be heard and to be informed would be protected. Those provisions have now been incorporated in the juvenile crime bill ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee. 
In addition, Senator Kennedy and I incorporated a number of her suggestions in S. 1081, the `Crime Victims Assistance Act.' That bill would reform the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. In particular, the legislation would provide crime victims with an enhanced right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention, on plea bargains, at sentencing, on probation revocation, and to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison. The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that are currently before Congress by including enhanced penalties for witness intimidation, an increase in Federal victim assistance personnel, enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and officers of the Court, development of state of the art systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases, and the establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims. 
I know that crime victim advocates in Vermont join me in thanking Aileen for her service. I was delighted that Aileen could come to Vermont to keynote the restorative justice conference in Vermont last June. Our Vermont advocates are well aware of the extraordinary efforts at OVC and have worked with OVC to create greater opportunities for rural programs. With support from OVC, Vermont has been able to implement its victims programs for outreach to underserved populations and coordinate among providers and allied professionals. 
I was especially proud when the recent site visit to Vermont resulted in the Justice Department concluding that `Vermont's programs are setting the standard for outreach to under served populations and service coordination among providers and allied professionals.' 
Aileen Adams has dedicated her service to the needs of crime victims. She has made a difference. She has improved federal programs for victims of domestic violence, victims of terrorism, and crime victim assistance generally. She has helped create a strong funding source for crime victim compensation and assistance programs. She has worked to expand crime victims rights. Most importantly, she has made a difference in the lives of crime victims all across the country.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator DeWine in introducing the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act. This legislation will address and strengthen our services for disabled victims of crime throughout our country. 
It is important that we focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims not only during this week, National Crime Victims Rights Week, but throughout the year. For the past several years, I have worked hard with others to make improvements in the law and provide greater assistance to victims of crime. 
My involvement with crime victims rights began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic violence, rather than presents additional ordeals for those already victimized. 
The needs of victims of crime are many and must be addressed in a number of ways, including strengthening law enforcement and education, improving and increasing services for victims, and protecting the rights of victims. Today I am proud to again have the support of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services in focusing attention on the needs of crime victims with disabilities with the Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act. 
Research conducted abroad has shown that individuals with disabilities have a four to 10 times higher risk of becoming a victim than do individuals without disabilities. Despite these findings, there have been no significant studies on this subject conducted in the United States. The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act we are introducing today will rectify this omission. 
The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act proposes to have the Committee on Law and Justice of the National Academy of Sciences conduct research so as to increase public awareness of victims of crime with disabilities, to understand the nature and extent of such crimes, and to develop strategies to address the safety and needs of victims of crime with disabilities. This Act directs the Attorney General to utilize statistics gathered from this study for inclusion in the National Crime Victims Survey. The Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act also directs the Attorney General to submit a report detailing the means by which each State can establish and maintain a database on the incidence of crimes against individuals with disabilities. 
Over the last 20 years we have made strides in recognizing crime victims' rights and providing much needed assistance. I am proud to have played a role in passage of the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, and the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and the other improvements we have been able to make. 
In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Congress acted to ensure a right of allocation for victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse and to make tens of millions of dollars available to crime victims. No amount of money can make up for the harm and trauma of being the victim of a crime, but we should do all that we can to see that victims are assisted, compensated and treated with dignity by the criminal justice system. 
I was the author of the Victims of Terrorism Act that was passed by the Senate in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and became the basis for the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act signed into law in April 1996. We were able to make funds available through supplemental grants to the States to assist and compensate victims of terrorism and mass violence, which incidents might otherwise have overwhelmed the resources of Oklahoma's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance services. We also filled a gap in our law for residents of the United States who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur outside the borders of the United States. In addition, we allowed greater flexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and some greater certainty so that they can know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax and wane with events. And we were able to raise the assessments on those convicted of federal crimes in order to fund the needs of crime victims. 
Last year, I cosponsored the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. That legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing the fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony during the sentencing phase of that trial. As a result of that legislation, not only were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing able to observe the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all those who were able to witness the trial and were called as witnesses to provide victim impact testimony at the sentencing phase of that trial were able to do so. 
The Crime Victims Assistance Act, legislation that I introduced this past July with Senator Kennedy, builds upon the progress made over the last several years. It provides for a wholesale reform of the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. This bill would provide crime victims with an enhanced right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention and plea bargains, an enhanced right to a speedy trial and to be present in the courtroom throughout a trial, an enhanced right to be heard on probation revocation and to give a statement at sentencing, and the right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison. The Crime Victims Assistance Act would also strengthen victims' services by increasing Federal victim assistance personnel, enhancing training for State and local law enforcement and Officers of the Court, and establishing and ombudsman program for crime 
victims. 
With a simple majority of both Houses of Congress, the Crime Victims Assistance Act could be enacted this year and we could mark a significant and immediate difference in the lives of victims throughout our country. I hope that the Senate will turn to this important measure without further delay. Unfortunately, one consequence of the effort to focus attention on proposals to amend the Constitution has been to dissipate efforts to enact effective victims rights legislation over the past two years. The momentum we had built over the last several years has been dissipated by this focus to the exclusion of statutory reform. 
While we have made great improvements in our law enforcement and crime victims assistance programs and have made advances in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have work to do. This week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Crime victims advocates across Vermont and the nation are commemorating this week with ceremonies, awards and proclamations. I am honored to have received recognition from the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services and the Vermont Network for Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault during National Crime Victims Rights Week in 1996 and a Congressional Leadership Award from the National Organization for Victim Assistance. Each year at this time our hearts go out to the families and victims of crime. Each year I try to help focus attention on those who work so hard every week of the year on behalf of all crime victims in crime victims' assistance and compensation programs. 
There are many individuals in Vermont who I would like to thank for their expertise and advice in addressing victims' rights and services, including Lori Hayes, Executive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services, and Marty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. Their hard work and dedication have made a real difference in the lives of people who suffer from violence and abuse. 
In May 1997, the Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime concluded that `Vermont's programs are setting the standard for outreach to undeserved populations and service coordination among providers and allied professionals.' Vermont's leadership was also recently recognized with its selection for participation in the Department of Justice Rural Victim Services 2000 project. The Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services will administer this grant to conduct the first systematic survey of what rural crime victims need. The more informed we become of the needs of victims, the more we can adapt services to make them more effective and efficient. 
I commend all those in Vermont and across the country who are committed to assisting crime victims.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Boxer's amendment to the Education IRA bill because it will ensure schools across our nation have the additional resources they need to establish and expand after-school programs for school-aged children. With more and more parents of school-aged children working outside the home, we, as a nation, must make a commitment to our children to ensure they have safe and supervised places to be during the after-school hours. This amendment would provide much-needed funding to schools to set up such programs in their buildings or other public facilities, a cost-efficient way to provide children and teens with activities after the school bell rings. 
With youth at most risk of getting into trouble between 3 and 8 p.m., this additional funding will help keep teens out of trouble during these critical hours. I know how effective and important after-school programs are, parents around the country know it and our law enforcement officers know it. In fact, a recent survey of nearly 800 police chiefs from across the nation found that 90 percent of the chiefs viewed prevention as a key factor in reducing our nation's juvenile crime rates. In my opinion, the best crime reduction strategy is one which prevents crime from happening. The $250 million authorized in this amendment is a good investment, not only because it will provide children with a safe haven, but also because it will likely lead to reduced crime rates in neighborhoods which choose to implement or expand their after-school programs. 
I am particularly pleased with the flexibility provided in Senator Boxer's amendment. While no school is required to participate, those which do may use the funds for children of any age--from kindergarten through high school. Those schools which choose to participate would also have the flexibility to decide what sort of programs to offer. For example, schools receiving grants could engage in mentoring activities, tutoring or academic assistance programs, recreational activities or technology training. So long as a school offers at least two of these activities, it would meet the grant's eligibility requirements. Schools could also offer drug or alcohol prevention programs, gang prevention programs, health and nutrition counseling and job skills training. These broad categories of activities will allow the local schools to decide how their children spend their after-school hours while ensuring that the children and teens are engaged in productive activities. 
Vermont is fortunate to have a wide variety of after-school programs available for children, both on and off school campuses. I have been working to ensure this diversity of programs continues. But, I hear again and again from parents in Vermont that we need more after-school programs for our state's children. Senator Boxer's amendment would ensure one piece of the puzzle is better funded--after-school programs on school and public property. I plan to continue pushing for other resources for after-school, evening and weekend programs, including in S.10, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1997. As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been fighting hard to ensure that S.10 has dedicated funding for a variety of crime prevention programs. Senator Boxer's amendment is a perfect complement to these ongoing efforts.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I have said many times on the floor of the Senate, I am blessed to come from and in fact represent a State in which people share a deep and abiding concern for the environment. In many ways, Vermont is an example to the Nation in its environmental ethics and its environmental action. 
We Vermonters are especially proud that much of the environmental progress the Nation has achieved in the last 3 decades is also part of the legacy of Vermont's own Robert Stafford. Senator Stafford's leadership in this body helped shape national environmental policy from the time the environmental movement was in its infancy, and then continued well into its maturity. In his role as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works--a post that Senator Stafford assumed in 1981--Bob Stafford courageously and successfully stood up to the powerful interests who tried to roll back our environmental standards. Today, as we celebrate the 28th anniversary of Earth Day, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the progress we have made to protect our environment. But I also want to talk about the job that remains to be done. 
In the past few weeks, one of Vermont's great treasures, Lake Champlain, has received a great deal of attention. This has also offered an opportunity to explain one of the threats to Lake Champlain from toxic pollutants that are drifting into our State. One of these pollutants, mercury, should be of particular concern. Like lakes and waterways in most States, Lake Champlain now has fish advisories for walleye and lake trout and bass. All that is due to mercury. 
When I was growing up and I could spend parts of my summers on Lake Champlain, I never had to worry about eating the fish that I caught. Actually, I only had to worry about being good enough to catch them in the first place. But someday, when I take my grandson out fishing, I don't want to explain to him why he can't eat a fish he catches there. What I tell my grandson is largely a function of what direction we decide to take in Congress to protect the environment. Depending upon what we do here, that will determine whether I can tell him to eat the fish or not. Are we going to rest on our laurels, or are we going to build on the courageous steps that Bob Stafford and others took to protect our environment for future generations? 
We should be proud of the great strides we have made to reduce the level of many air and water pollutants, to rebuild populations of endangered species, and to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites. And we are proud of that. But now we have to continue to address the environmental threats that do not have any easy solutions. One of these threats is the mercury that seeps into our air and water every day from coal-fired power plants and waste combustors and utility boilers. It is one of the last remaining toxins for which there is no control strategy. 
When we originally wrote the Clean Air Act, we didn't understand the dangers posed by mercury, but we have seen the dangers in our own State. Two high schools in my own State had to be closed for a week because there were small amounts of mercury found in the classrooms. But these were instances where you could actually see the mercury. The more elusive problems are the ones where the mercury goes through the air and water and we don't see it. With the release of the Environmental Protection Agency's Mercury Study Protection Report to Congress, we have the information to solve the problem of mercury pollution. We have the information to solve the problem. The question we have to ask is: Do we have the will to solve it? 
The report shows some very troubling levels of mercury in fish, and also estimates in the United States there are more than 1 1/2 million pregnant women and their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children who are at risk of brain and nerve development damage from mercury pollution. 
There are new facts of mercury pollution, too. Look at this chart. In 1993, there were 27 States with fish advisories for mercury contamination. These are the States in red. There are 899 lakes, river segments and streams identified as yielding mercury-contaminated fish. That was just 5 years ago. 
Now let's see what has happened as we go to 1997. Look at how the red is filling up the country. You can see that 39 States have issued mercury fish advisories for 1,675 water bodies. This is where we are with mercury-contaminated fish; almost every State in the country, 1,675 advisories. 
In only 5 years, it is an increase of 86 percent. We are going in the wrong direction. We are soon going to see the map totally red. 
What we should be doing, Mr. President, is trying to reverse course, getting rid of this mercury pollution and going back to where we can have a country without them. 
We pump 150 tons of mercury into the atmosphere every year--every year, year after year after year. It doesn't go away. It becomes more potent. We put a lot of love and time and energy and fiscal resources into our children, but we are not protecting them from the possibility of being poisoned by a potent neurotoxin. 
The critics of inaction are right. We can't tell to what degree people with learning disorders, coordination problems, hearing, sight or speech problems have been harmed by mercury pollution. We don't know how many little Sarahs or Johnnys would have been gifted physicians, poets or teachers but who now have no chance of reaching their full potential because they are exposed to mercury in the womb or during early childhood. 
Just as with lead, we know that mercury has much graver effects on children at very low levels than it does on adults. It is insidious. 
Because we can't measure how much potential has been lost, some special interests say we should continue to do nothing. 
Our late colleague, Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, put it well when he said, `[t]he first responsibility of Congress is not the making of technological or economic judgments. Our responsibility is to establish what the public interest requires'--requires--`to protect the health of persons.' 
We have enough information to act. We don't have to wait until we have a body count. We have the information, now we need the will, and we should have the will to act. 
I propose we put a stop to this poisoning of America. Mercury can be removed from products. It has been done. Mercury can be removed from coal-fired powerplants, and it should be done. We should limit the mercury that enters our environment from coal-fired powerplants, waste incinerators, and large industrial boilers and other known sources. 
Americans have a right to know what is being spewed out of these facilities and into their backyards and into the food of their children. We in Congress have the responsibility to give them the knowledge and the tools to protect their children.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, that wasn't precisely the way that I recall the intent of the unanimous consent agreement, but let me just say this. The EPA report estimates the cost nationally of controlling mercury from powerplants at $5 billion per year, and this is an industry that generates more than $200 billion a year in revenue. That is less than 2.5 percent. It strikes me as being the equivalent of a fly on an elephant's back. We can do a lot better. 
The residents of Colchester, VT have been fighting for 7 years to clean up a waste incinerator in their backyard that they were originally told was clean enough to toast marshmallows in. Well, now we know better and we need to require this and other facilities to eliminate mercury emissions. 
One of the largest sources of mercury is coal-fired power plants. With States deregulating their utility industries, Congress today has a unique opportunity to make sure these powerplants begin to internalize the cost of their pollution. 
Many of the problems the Clean Air Act of 1970 was drafted to solve are being addressed. But one thing has not worked out the way Congress originally envisioned. It seemed back then that old, dirty, inefficient power plants would eventually be retired and replaced by a new generation of clean and efficient plants. The concept worked with tailpipe controls on cars. Eventually the fleet turns over and the dirty ones are out of circulation. 
But, 28 years later, many utilities continue to operate dirty, inefficient plants that were built in the 1950s or before. These plants are subject to much less stringent pollution controls than are new facilities, and what we now have is a big loophole, and these plants are pouring pollution through it. 
If we don't level the pollution playing field now, in a deregulated industry the financial incentive will be to pump even more power and pollution out of these plants for as long as they will last. As long as the rules of the game allow this, these utility companies are acting in a manner that suits solely their economic self interest. As a nation, we cannot afford to subsidize their inefficiency, but our inaction does just that. 
We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing this bill will cost. I want to address those complaints up front. The cost argument does not hold water. I say it again, the EPA report estimates the cost nationally of controlling mercury from power plants at $5 billion per year, and this industry generates more than $200 billion a year in revenue. That is less that two and a half percent, and that strikes me as being the equivalent of a fly on an elephant's back. 
Mercury pollution is a key piece of unfinished business in cleaning up our environment. The poisoning of America's lakes, rivers, lands, and citizens with mercury pollution can be stopped. It is unnecessary, and continuing to ignore it mortgages the health of our children and grandchildren. 
I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the mastermind of one of this century's most horrific crimes against humanity died apparently peacefully in his sleep. Pol Pot, founder and leader of the Khmer Rouge, architect of the grisly genocide which claimed at least one million Cambodian lives between 1975 and 1979, died at the age of 73. While some may see Pol Pot's death as final closure on one of the most shockingly brutal and despotic reigns in history, his death should not absolve the international community from seeking justice for the people of Cambodia. 
The scars from Pol Pot's four-year reign of terror remain in Cambodia, and on the face of humanity. History will judge us. Did they do enough? Did they do what they could? Did they even care? If those assessments were written today, the community of nations would be found wanting. The fact that Pol Pot lived to his dying day having never been punished for his crimes is the best evidence of that. 
When Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge captured the Cambodian capitol of Phnom Penh in April 1975, he and his lieutenants began a barbaric campaign to exterminate intellectuals, foreigners, bureaucrats, merchants, and countless others who did not fit Pol Pot's vision of a `pure' Cambodia. Many thousands more were forced into slave labor camps, eventually dying from starvation, torture, and disease. I have met some of the survivors of that nightmare who escaped to Thailand and ultimately resettled in the United States, including in Vermont. They are a living tribute to the invincibility of the human spirit. 
Four years later in 1979 Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were forced from power, but they left behind a ghastly swath of death and carnage that counted at least one million Cambodians dead and a country that to this day is trying to cope with the ghosts of that era. Virtually every Cambodian now alive knows or is related to someone who perished under the Khmer Rouge. 
Although Pol Pot was the architect of the killing fields of Cambodia, those in his inner circle were responsible for carrying out his commands. Many of Pol Pot's chief lieutenants still roam the Cambodian countryside, reportedly along the Thai border. Men like Khieu Samphan, former President of Kampuchea; Nuon Chea, former second in command and someone described as Pol Pot's `alter ego;' and Ta Mok, a Khmer Rouge leader whose portfolio included killing Cambodians who had worked for the old Lon Nol government. Ta Mok was nicknamed `the Butcher.' 
The wanton killing did not end decades ago. In 1996 British mine clearer Christopher Howes and his Cambodian interpreter, Houn Hourth, were abducted by Khmer Rouge soldiers and later led to a field and shot in the back. According to recent reports of interviews with Khmer Rouge officials, aides close to Pol Pot ordered the killing. Mr. Howes posed no threat to Pol Pot or the Khmer Rouge. He was in Cambodia working to make the country safer for the Cambodian people by helping remove one-by-one the millions of landmines sown in the fields. Today, Cambodia is infested with mines which continue to maim and kill the innocent. 
I am encouraged that the Administration appears ready to seek some formal mechanism to bring to justice key members of Pol Pot's inner circle. A number of possible approaches have been suggested, including a war crimes tribunal for Cambodia like the existing tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, or an international penal tribunal that includes Cambodian participation. These ideas and others merit further discussion as we examine appropriate ways to seek justice for the Cambodian people. 
The United Nations has also named a three-person team to investigate the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders. This too, is an encouraging sign. 
Whatever it takes, we must not let the fact that Pol Pot eluded justice diminish our resolve to apprehend and punish the members of his inner circle who are also guilty of crimes against humanity. History will judge us harshly if we turn our backs now.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Secretary Albright is planning to travel to China soon to discuss a wide range of important issues with Chinese officials. Her trip is in anticipation of a subsequent visit by President Clinton. On her agenda will be the issue of human rights, and I want to use this opportunity to remind other Senators of the case of Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan ethnomusicologist and former Middlebury College student. Mr. Choephel came to this country on a Fulbright Scholarship, and in September 1995 he was arrested in Tibet for making a film about traditional Tibetan music and dance. On December 26, 1996, just one month after I spoke to Chinese President Jiang Zemin personally about Mr. Choephel, he was sentenced after a secret trial to 18 years in prison. 
This case goes to the heart of our ongoing difficulties with the Chinese Government on human rights. I have repeatedly asked for, and never received, a shred of evidence that Mr. Choephel was engaged in any illegal or political activity. His crime, it appears, was that he was Tibetan and wanted to preserve Tibetan culture. 
Mr. President, every country has the right to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct that threatens the safety of others. But no country has the right to violate internationally recognized human rights which are the rights of all people regardless of nationality. As long as a person can be imprisoned for doing nothing more than making a film about Tibetan culture, our relations with China will continue to suffer. By releasing Mr. Choephel, the Chinese Government would risk nothing, but it would represent an important step to those of us who are looking for credible signs that the Chinese Government genuinely wants to improve its human rights record.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for calling up the nomination of Ivan Lemelle to the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. 
Judge Lemelle's nomination has been pending over a year. When the Chief Judge of the Eastern District of Louisiana testified in May 1996 that the vacancies on that Court should not be filled, it put this nomination on hold. I only wish that when the Chief Justice of the United States says that we need more judges, when Chief Judges in the Second Circuit and other Circuits and Districts say that they need their vacancies filled without further delay, we would listen to them. 
Judge Sear has recently written a letter to Senator Breaux that reports that his Court now unanimously votes to fill the two vacancies in that District. I know that as a Magistrate Judge Ivan Lemelle has already contributed to the administration of justice in that District. It is high time to provide him the opportunity to contribute more fully to handling the District's caseload. 
I congratulate and thank Senator Breaux and Senator Landrieu for their effective advocacy in support of this nomination. 
Before adjourning for a two-week recess, it is important for the Senate to clear its calendar of nominations to the maximum extent possible. We made some progress today. I have been urging the Majority Leader to move judicial nominations through the Senate and I thank him for moving Judge Lemelle. 
As the Senate recesses, seven judicial nominations still remain on the calendar awaiting Senate action. With this additional confirmation, the Senate will still have confirmed only 20 judges for the year in which the Federal courts have experienced 100 vacancies. So, while I thank the Senate for its actions today, I must note that we have not ended the crisis of which the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned in his most recent year end report. 
Most troubling to me are the continuing vacancies on the Second Circuit. I deeply regret the Senate's unwillingness to vote upon the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit or to provide hearings for Judge Rosemary Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub. I look forward to action on these and the other judicial nominees left pending before the Senate.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tomorrow, April 3, 1998, is Equal Pay Day. This is the day by which women will have had to work all of 1997 and the first three months of 1998 to make what a man made in 1997 alone. We are not talking about jobs requiring different skills or abilities. We are talking about equal pay for equal work. This is not a glass ceiling, this is a glass wall. Women cannot break the glass ceiling until the wall comes down and they are given the equal pay that they deserve. 
Early in the next century, women--for the first time ever--will outnumber men in the United States workplace. In 1965, women held 35 percent of all jobs. That has grown to more than 45 percent today. And in a few years, women will make up a majority of the workforce. 
Fortunately, there are more business and career opportunities for women today than there were thirty years ago. Unlike 1965, federal, state, and private sector programs now offer women many opportunities to choose their own futures. Working women also have opportunities to gain the knowledge and skills to achieve their own economic security. 
But despite these gains, working women still face a unique challenge--achieving pay equity. The average woman earns 74 cents for every dollar that the average man earns. According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, one-half of the pay gap is due to discrimination. This is unacceptable. 
This discrimination is evident even in traditionally female professions such as nursing. For example, Marcelle, my wife, is a registered nurse. Female registered nurses make on average $7,600 a year less than men. It is unacceptable when female nurses make only 80 percent of the wages of their male counterparts for the same work. 
My home state of Vermont is a leader in providing pay equity. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, Vermont ranks third in providing equal pay. Even with this ranking, the average woman in Vermont still is making less than 76 cents for every dollar that the average man makes in Vermont. We must work in the Senate and in the workplace to close this gap. 
I am pleased to join Senator Daschle in reintroducing the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation will help to address the problem of pay inequality by redressing past discrimination and increasing enforcement against future abuses. 
Senator Harkin is also a true leader on pay equity. I am an original cosponsor of his bill, the Fair Pay Act, which prohibits pay discrimination based on sex, race or national origin. These two pieces of legislation will help to provide women with what they deserve: equal pay for equal work. 
I understand that these bills will not solve all of the problems of pay inequity, but they will close legal loopholes that allow employers to routinely underpay women. By closing these loopholes, we will help women achieve better economic security and provide them with more opportunities. 
Women are being advanced in the workplace and the glass ceiling is slowly cracking. Last year, President Clinton appointed Madeline Albright as the first female Secretary of State, and I am proud that Vermont is also a leader in advancing women in the workplace. The University of Vermont has a female president, Dr. Judith Ramaley, and Martha Rainville was recently elected Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard--the first woman in the nation to hold this position. While women are advancing in the workplace, we need to ensure that they are receiving fair pay for their work. 
I want to commend Senator Daschle and Senator Harkin on their initiative in introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay Act. I also want to recognize and commend the hundreds of organizations around the country that will recognize tomorrow as Equal Pay Day.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 
last week, faced with five continuing vacancies on a 13-member Court, Chief Judge Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified the judicial emergency caused by these continuing vacancies, began canceling hearings and took the unprecedented step in the Second Circuit of authorizing 3-judge panels to be composed of two visiting judges and only one Second Circuit Judge. 
The Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the Second Circuit, but her nomination continues to sit on the Senate calendar. Her nomination was received back in June 1997. She was favorably reported by a Committee vote of 16 to 2, once the Committee finally considered her nomination. She is strongly supported by both New York Senators, yet the nomination continues to languish without consideration. 
Three additional outstanding Second Circuit nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee and await their confirmation hearings. Judge Rosemary Pooler was nominated back on November 6, 1997, as was Robert Sack, a partner in the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. The final pending nomination to the Second Circuit was received two months ago, back on February 11, when the President nominated Chester J. Straub, a partner in the law firm of Wilkie Farr & Gallagher. 
I have been urging action on the nominees to the Second Circuit for many months. The Senate is failing in its obligations to the people of the Second Circuit, to the people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end to this stall and take action. 
Last Friday I urged consideration of the nomination of Judge Sotomayor without further delay and requested that the Judiciary Committee proceed to hold the necessary hearings on the three other Second Circuit nominees this week so that they, too, might be confirmed before the upcoming recess. 
I do not believe that the Senate should be leaving for two weeks' recess and leaving the Second Circuit with vacancies for which it has qualified nominations pending. This is too reminiscent of the government shutdown only a couple of years ago and the numerous times of late when the Republican congressional leadership has recessed without completing work on emergency supplemental and disaster relief legislation. 
In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned that persisting vacancies would harm the administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly declared: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' 
The people and businesses in the Second Circuit need additional federal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the 5 vacancies, the Second Circuit be allocated an additional 2 judgeships to handle its workload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from Senate inaction. That is why the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit had to declare the Circuit in a state of emergency. 
Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the nominees pending before it? I hope not. 
As part of my efforts to encourage the Senate to do its job, I am today introducing the Judicial Emergency Responsibility Act. The purpose of this bill is to supplement the law by which Chief Justice Winter certified the emergency and to require the Senate to do its duty and to act on judicial nominations before it recesses for significant stretches of time when a Circuit Court is suffering from a vacancy emergency. 
I urge prompt action on the bill and immediate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the `Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998.' As United States Senators, we all have a responsibility to build a nation for our children. As a recent grandfather, this commitment has never been more real for me. I am introducing this comprehensive piece of legislation to eliminate mercury--one of the last remaining poisons without a specific control strategy--from our air, our waters and our forests. By eliminating mercury from our natural resources, we will protect our nation's most important resource--our children and grandchildren. 
As we learned from the campaign to eliminate lead, our children are at the greatest risk from these poisons. I often ask myself how many Albert Einsteins have we lost in the last generation because of the toxics they have been exposed to? Just as with lead, we know that mercury has much graver effects on children at very low levels then it does on adults. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. I want to achieve the same results with mercury. 
Mercury is toxic in every known form and of utterly no nutritional value. At high enough levels it poisons its victims in terribly tragic ways. In Japan, victims of mercury poisoning came to be known as suffering from Minimata Disease, which took its name from the small Minimata Bay in which they caught fish for their food. 
For years, the Chisso Company discharged mercury contaminated pollution in the Bay, which was taken into the flesh of fish and then the people who ate them. Their disease was frightfully painful, causing tremors and paralysis, and sometimes leading to death. Thankfully, discharges of mercury like those in Minimata Bay have been eliminated. But a torrent of air pollution still needlessly pours this heavy metal into the air of North America, poisoning lakes and streams, forests and fields and--most importantly--our children. Mercury control needs to be a priority now because we know, without a doubt, of the neurological damage it causes. 
This is not to say that men, women and children are doubled over in agony as they were three decades ago in Japan. But wildlife are being killed--we know that endangered Florida panthers have been fatally poisoned by mercury and that loons are endangered as well. In Lake Champlain we now have fish advisories for walleye, trout and bass even though we have relatively no mercury emissions within our own state borders. 
Instead, we Vermonters are exposed to mercury and other pollutants that blow across Lake Champlain and the Green Mountains every day from other regions of the country. The waste incinerators and coal-fired power plants are not accountable to the people of Vermont and therefore a federal role is needed to control the pollution. 
That is part of the reason voters send us here. They expect Members of the Congress to determine what is necessary to protect the public health and the environment nationally, then require it. And in many cases, perhaps most, we have done that. But not with respect to mercury. 
Mr. President, what I propose is that we put a stop to this poisoning of America. It is unnecessary, and it is wrong. Mercury can be removed from products, and it has been done. Mercury can be removed from coal-fired powerplants, and it should be done. With states deregulating their utility industries, this is the best opportunity to make sure powerplants begin to internalize the cost of their pollution. We cannot afford to give them a free ride into the next century at the expense of our children's health. 
So, too, should mercury be purged from chlor alkali plants, medical waste incinerators, municipal combustion facilities, large industrial boilers, landfills, lighting fixtures and other known sources. 
My bill directs EPA to set mercury emission standards for the largest sources of mercury emissions. The bill requires reducing emissions by 95 percent, but it also lets companies choose the best approach to meet the standard at their facility whether through the use of better technology, cleaner fuels, process changes, or product switching. 
We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing this bill will cost. In advance of those complaints I want to make two points. First, when we were debating controls for acid rain we heard a lot about the enormous cost of eliminating sulphur dioxide. But what we learned from the acid rain program, is that when you give industry a financial incentive to clean up their act they will find the cheapest way. More often than not, assertions about the cost of controlling pollution grossly overestimate and distort reality. If you look at electricity prices of major utilities since the acid rain program was implemented, their rates have remained below the national average and some have actually decreased--even without adjusting for inflation. 
Secondly, and most importantly, the bottom line here should not be the cost of controlling mercury emissions, but the cost of NOT controlling mercury. While we may not be able to calculate how many Einstein's we have lost, if we lose one the price has been too high.

Mr. LEAHY. 
Mr. President, I have voiced my great disappointment many times with how the Telecommunications Act of 1966 is costing consumers millions of dollars. 
I complained about this at the time that Act passed, and continue to be concerned that Vermonters are being taken to the cleaners. 
I was one of five Senators to vote against that bill. I thought it was clear then, and it should be clear by now to everyone, that the Telecommunications bill means higher costs for consumers. 
As other hi-tech industries, such as computer technology, offer lower and lower prices over time--the telephone and cable TV industries are presenting consumers with higher and higher charges. 
For example, I am mad as heck that pay phone charges in Vermont went up to 35 cents--from 10 cents. 
But what annoys me more is that if I do not have exact change--if I use two quarters--the change the phone company keeps is more than the ten cents the call used to cost. 
I have been know to say `keep the change' in restaurants, or when I buy a newspaper. 
But I do not like phone companies taking my change. I am fed up with pay phone service providers nickel and diming consumers. 
This bill will make phone companies provide change to consumers at the pay phone--or provide a credit in the amount of the lost change to the consumer or to states to be used to help consumers. 
My bill will also give the FCC broad powers to give states authority to control pay phone rates, if necessary. 
The bill permits pay phone providers in Vermont to issue a credit when change is not provided to the consumer which would go to Vermont. This means that Vermont could provide better pay phone service for public safety or health reasons. 
For example, this fund could be used by states to provide better pay phone service to those with disabilities, or those living in nursing homes. It would provide funding for pay phones to be placed in remote areas in case of emergencies. 
I would rather this change go directly to the consumer, and believe when this bill is fully implemented that most consumers will not be overcharged for calls. 
In the meantime, however, I would rather have the change used to benefit Vermonters than go to the phone companies. 
There are over 2 million pay phones in the United States. The Washington Post explained on Monday that if 75 percent of 
those pay phones charge 35 cents for a local call and if just one person a day overpays 15 cents at each of those phones, companies would get more than $230,000 extra a day, or about $7 million a month. 
My guess is that this hugely underestimates the size of this windfall. 
Keep in mind this windfall, in Vermont, is on top of the raise from 10 cents to 35 cents. I have also noticed fewer and fewer phone booths except at places such as airports or train stations where consumers are in a hurry and may not have time to track down change. 
My bill goes beyond just keeping phone companies from getting windfall profits. It calls for a national investigation of monopoly pricing and price gouging in the pay telephone markets. 
It goes further than that--it then gives the Federal Communications Commission the tough new authority to deal with this problem. It allows them to give states the right to establish rates for local calls if necessary to stop this overcharging. Remember, when Vermont was in charge before the Telecommunications Act passed the pay phone rates were a dime. 
My bill will also encourage the development of new technologies so that consumers are not overcharged for local phone calls to begin with. 
My bill also provides funding--and the money comes from telephone companies not consumers--for public interest pay phones. These are phones which the FCC has determined each state should provide to its citizens in areas where there otherwise might not be a phone. They did this in a decision issued on October 7, 1996. 
This was a good idea--but there is no federal funding to implement the decision. 
In addition, it is uneconomic for a phone company to provide a pay phone in remote areas of Vermont. But in a roadside emergency these phones could be vital. My bill would provide for this program using money that now just goes out of your pockets to the phone companies. 
Also, public interest pay phones could be placed in nursing homes, emergency homeless shelters, emergency rooms in hospitals, and other similar places. 
Emergency 911 calls would be free from these phones, and other calls would cost but at least there would be a phone in a location where there otherwise might not be one. 
What is best about this approach is that Vermont would decide how to use this funding that now goes directly into the coffers of phone companies. 
I have also designed the bill in a way that prevents phone companies from trying to take advantage of this situation. 
The bill gives the FCC board powers to ensure that the pay phone providers `do not pass any costs relating to such compliance to consumers.' 
It also mandates that the FCC monitor this situation and ensure that implementation does not result in any reduction in pay phone service. 
The bill requires that pay phone companies which charge more than 10 cents for local phone calls provide either cash change or other alternatives to consumers, or credits to states equal to the value of the unpaid change. 
These credits to states would be used by states for telecommunications activities that promote the public interest, such as safety, health, emergency services, or education and promote public interest pay phones in hospitals, schools, emergency homeless shelters, facilities for the disabled, and at similar types of locations. 
The bill directs the FCC, within one year of the bill's enactment, to issue proposed rules that apply to pay phone providers that charge more than 10 cents for local pay phone calls. Companies would have to provide for cash change or automatically credit the appropriate public service agency in the respective states to account for instances in which change is not provided at the pay phone. 
The bill requires that the FCC ensure that pay phone providers do not pass any costs of compliance with this bill on to consumers and that pay phone providers in no way reduce or limit service based on this anti-windfall requirement. 
The FCC is given major new powers to take action to prevent any price gouging including giving states back the authority to regulate the price of local calls. 
The bill requires that small stickers or other notice be posted on pay phones for the purpose of advising consumers when cash change will not be provided. 
The bill directs the FCC to reconsider its rules under which the FCC removed authority from states to regulate the charge for local calls made over pay phones. The FCC would reexamine the need for states to have greater decision making roles where local competition between pay phone providers is not present.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Vietnam Veterans of America for 20 years of service to veterans and their communities. In particular, I want to recognize the first chapter of the VVA, which was founded in Rutland, Vermont. 
If we remember back to the late 1970s, our nation was dealing with the aftermath of a war in which more than 58,000 Americans lost their lives and 2.8 million veterans had served. Many of those veterans were struggling with physical, emotional, and social problems directly related to their service in Vietnam. 
Those problems were worsened by the attitude of many Americans who could not separate their opposition to the war from their treatment of our soldiers who had fought it. It was in that spirit that a group of Vietnam veterans from Vermont approached a resourceful young veteran named Bobby Muller. I am proud to say that Bobby Muller has become a close friend of mine and in fact was in Vermont with me just last week. The Vermonters, led by Donny Beaudette and Jake Jacobsen, founded the first chapter of what is now the Vietnam Veterans of America. I remember it well. They were soon joined by other Vermonters like Clark Howland, Mike Dodge, John Bergeron, and others. Together, Chapter One made it their mission to be there for Vermont Vietnam veterans and indeed all veterans. 
In the twenty years since then, Chapter One has accomplished that mission, and in the process they have improved the whole Rutland community. They have not only offered assistance to fellow veterans, they have saved the lives of countless troubled veterans who had no where else to turn. Chapter One is responsible for the Dodge Development Center, a veterans center and shelter for homeless veterans which I have been proud to support. Members participate in the annual Rutland Loyalty Day Parade, Memorial Day and Veterans Day and annual POW/MIA Day ceremonies. Chapter One has also initiated an `Honor the Vet Program' with area businesses. Under this program, local businesses agree to provide a discount to any veteran with a veteran organization membership card. 
In short, Mr. President, VVA Chapter One honors Vermont, just as its veterans honored us with their service in Vietnam. There are now four chapters carrying on the VVA tradition in Vermont. Besides Chapter One in Rutland, there is now chapter Chapter 601 in Bennington, Chapter 723 in Chester and Chapter 753 in St. Albans. 
I thank them for all they have done and I wish them the best on this landmark occasion.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for calling up the nominations of Justice Kermit Lipez to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, Mrs. Johnnie Rawlinson to the District Court for the District of Nevada and Mr. Robert T. Dawson to the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. 
Before adjourning for a two-week recess, it is important for the Senate to clear its calendar of nominations to the maximum extent possible. Certainly the confirmation of these outstanding nominee, which the President sent to us back in October and November last year and earlier this year, are a step in the right direction. I have been urging the Majority Leader to move judicial nominations through the Senate and I thank him for doing so with respect to these nominees. 
As the Senate prepares to recess, eight judicial nominations still remain on the calendar awaiting Senate action. With these three additional confirmations, the Senate will still have confirmed less than 20 judges for the year. This, at a time when we have already witnessed 100 vacancies so far this year and we see another 10 on the horizon. So, while I thank the Senate for its actions today, I must note that we have not closed the vacancies gap or ended the crisis of which the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned in his most recent year end report. 
Most troubling to me are the continuing vacancies on the Second Circuit. I deeply regret the Senate's unwillingness to date to vote upon the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit or to provide hearings for Judge Rosemary Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub. I will redouble my efforts to end the emergency that currently exists in the Second Circuit due to the five vacancies on that 13-member court. 
I look forward to prompt action on all of the 36 judicial nominees still pending before the Senate. In addition, I urge the President to make good use of the next several days and to continue to send to the Senate qualified nominees for each of the judicial vacancies.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to congratulate Senator Durbin and Senator Moseley-Braun on finally, at long last, achieving a vote on the nominations of Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. The Senators from Illinois have had to labor long and hard just to reach this point. I know that Senator Durbin did everything that he could think of to bring to the attention of the Republican leadership the need to consider and confirm these two judicial nominees who have been languishing on the Senate calendar without action for the last six months. I, too, have spoken about the plight of the Federal courts in the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois more often over the last several weeks and months than I would like to remember. 
We thank the Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle, for his efforts on behalf of these nominees and on behalf of achieving a vote. And I thank the Majority Leader for finally scheduling this vote and for working through whatever problems existed on the Republican side of the aisle that have delayed these nominations from early November to the end of the last session and for the first three months of this new session. 
It is long past time for the Senate to consider the nominations of Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported these two nominations to the full Senate on November 6, 1997--almost six months ago. Their confirmations are desperately needed to help end the vacancy crisis in the Federal District Courts of Illinois. 
Pat Murphy is an outstanding judicial nominee. A decorated Marine, he has practiced law in the State of Illinois for 20 years as a trial lawyer and tried about 250 cases to verdict or judgment as sole counsel. During his legal career, Mr. Murphy has made an extensive commitment to pro bono service--dedicating approximately 20 percent of his working time to representing disadvantaged clients in his community. 
Judge Michael McCuskey is also an outstanding judicial nominee. Judge McCuskey served as a Public Defender for Marshall County in Lacon, Illinois, for 8 years and has served as a State court judge for several years, first on the bench in the 10th Judicial Circuit and then on the Third District Appellate Court of Illinois. The American Bar Association recognized his stellar qualifications by giving Judge McCuskey its highest rating of well-qualified for this nomination. 
The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, like the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois, are growing more critical by the day. Indeed, in the Southern District of Illinois, where Pat Murphy will serve when confirmed, Chief Judge Gilbert has reported that his docket has been so burdened with criminal cases that he went a year without trying a civil case. 
The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called judicial vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' There is no justification for the Senate's delay in considering these two fine nominees for Districts suffering from judicial emergency vacancies. 
I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to have the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfill its constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. 
Last week the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals certified that the persisting vacancies on that Court require him to certify an emergency situation and to begin canceling hearings and proceeding with only one Second Circuit Judge on certain 3-judge appellate panels. There is a nominee for the Second Circuit on the Senate calendar awaiting Senate consideration, Judge Sonia Sotomayor. 
I came to the Senate floor last week to plead with the Republican leadership to proceed to consideration of the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. I renew that plea today and urge a vote on this nomination before the Senate adjourns for a 2-week recess. We should not go on recess while the Second Circuit needs action on nominees to alleviate a crisis.

I understand now he does not want to follow through with that agreement. I have already told our side that we would not request a rollcall. I will stick to my agreement. We will not request one.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is time the Administration woke up to the critical need for a common sense encryption policy in this country. I have been sounding the alarm bells about this issue for several years now, and have introduced encryption legislation, with Senator Burns and others, in the last Congress and again in this one, to balance the important privacy, economic, national security and law enforcement interests at stake. The volume of those alarm bells should be raised to emergency sirens. 
Because of the sorry state of our current encryption policies and, specifically, our export controls on encryption, we are seeing increasing numbers of high-tech jobs and expertise driven overseas. Recently, a large computer security company, Network Associates, announced that it will make strong encryption software developed in the United States available through a Swiss company. Encryption technology invented with American ingenuity, will now be manufactured and distributed in Europe, and imported back into this country. All those good, high-tech jobs associated with Network Associates' encryption product are now in Europe, not in Silicon Valley, not in Vermont, not in any American town, because of our outdated export controls on encryption. 
Network Associates is not the first American company to face the dilemma of how to supply its customers, both domestic and foreign, with the strong encryption they are demanding and also comply with current export restrictions on encryption. Other companies, including Sun Microsystems, are cooperating with foreign companies to manufacture and distribute overseas strong encryption software originally developed here at home. 
I have said before, and repeat here again, that driving encryption expertise overseas is a threat to our national security, driving high-tech jobs overseas is a threat to our economic security, and stifling the widespread, integrated use of strong encryption is a threat to our public safety. That is why I have called in legislation for relaxation of our export controls on encryption. 
Over the past month, we have learned of two serious breaches of computer security that threaten our critical infrastructures. Both incidents were apparently caused by teenagers using their home computers to trespass into the computer systems of the Department of Defense, the telephone network, the computer system for an airport control tower, and into the computer database of a pharmacy containing private medical records. One of these adolescent explorations in cyberspace disrupted telephone service in Rutland, Massachusetts and shut down the control tower at a small airport. 
The conduct of these teenagers is now the subject of criminal investigation, due in large part to the great strides we have made in updating our criminal laws to protect critical computer networks and the information on those networks. I am proud to have sponsored these computer crime laws in the last two Congresses. But targeting cybercrime with criminal laws and tough enforcement is only part of the solution. While criminal penalties may deter some computer criminals, these laws usually come into play too late, after the crime has been committed and the injury inflicted. 
We should keep in mind the adage that `the best defense is a good offense.' Americans and American firms must be encouraged to take preventive measures to protect their computer information and systems. A recent report by the FBI and Computer Security Institute released shows that the number of computer crimes and information security breaches continues to rise, resulting in over $136 million in losses in the last year alone. 
The lesson of the recent computer breaches by the teenagers is that all the physical barriers we might put in place can be circumvented using the wires that run into every building to support the computers and computer networks that are the mainstay of how we do business. A well-focused cyber-attack on the computer networks that support telecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking, electrical power and other critical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on our national economy or even jeopardize our national defense or public safety. 
We have been aware of the vulnerabilities of our computer networks for almost a decade. In 1988, I chaired hearings of the Subcommittee on Technology and the Law on the risks of high-tech terrorism. It became clear to me that merely `hardening' our physical space from potential attack is not enough. We must also `harden' our critical infrastructures to ensure our security and our safety. 
That is where encryption technology comes in. Encryption is one important tool in our arsenal to protect the security of our computer information and networks. Both former Senator Sam Nunn and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who serve as co-chairs of the Advisory Committee to the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, testified at a hearing last month that `encryption is essential for infrastructure protection.' 
Yet, even computer security experts agree that U.S. encryption policy has `acted as a deterrent to better security.' As long ago as 1988, at my High-Tech Terrorism hearing, Jim Woolsey, who later became the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, testified about the need to do a better job of using encryption to protect our computer networks. 
I have long advocated the use of strong encryption by individuals, government agencies and private companies to protect their valuable computer information. Indeed, a major thrust of the encryption legislation I have introduced is to encourage--and not stand in the way of--the widespread use of encryption. This would be a plus for both our law enforcement and national security agencies. 
Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go to update our country's encryption policy to reflect that this technology is a significant crime and terrorism prevention tool. I am particularly concerned by the testimony of former Senator Sam Nunn last month that the `continuing federal government-private sector deadlock over encryption and export policies' may pose an obstacle to the cooperation needed to protect our country's critical infrastructures. 
At the heart of the encryption debate is the power this technology gives computer users to choose who may access their communications and stored records, to the exclusion of all others. For the same reason that encryption is a powerful privacy enhancing tool, it also poses challenges for law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies want access even when we do not choose to give it. 
The FBI has made clear that law enforcement wants immediate access to the plaintext of encrypted communications and stored data, and, absent industry capitulation, will seek legislation to this effect. Indeed, while much of this debate has focused on relaxation of export controls, the FBI has upped the ante. Recognizing that the encryption genie is out of the bottle, the FBI has indicated it may seek import restrictions and domestic controls on encryption. 
The FBI has told me in response to written questions that: `[I]f the current voluntary efforts are not successful,. . . it is the responsibility of the FBI. . . to seek alternative approaches to alleviate the problems caused by encryption. This would include legislative remedies which effectively address law enforcement concerns regarding the import of robust encryption products, as well as encryption products manufactured for use in the U.S.' 
The Administration has not disavowed this position. In a recent letter to the Minority Leader, the Administration expressed a preference for a `good faith dialogue' and `cooperative solutions' over `seeking to legislate domestic controls,' but has clearly not ruled out the latter approach. 
Even as our law enforcement and intelligence agencies try to slow down the widespread use of strong encryption, technology continues to move forward. Ironically, foot-dragging by the Administration on export controls and threats by the FBI to call for domestic encryption controls, have only motivated computer scientists to find alternative means to protect the privacy of online communications that may, in fact, pose more of a challenge to law enforcement. 
Indeed, the terms of the current encryption debate may soon become moot. The New York Times reported a few weeks ago that Ronald Rivest of MIT has developed a new method for protecting the confidentiality of electronic messages that does not use encryption. Instead, this method breaks a message into separate packets, each marked with a special authentication header, and then `hides' those packets in a stream of other packets. Eavesdroppers would not know which packets were the `wheat' part of the message and which packets were the irrelevant `chafe'. As Mr. Rivest noted in his article announcing this technique, `attempts by law enforcement to regulate confidentiality by regulating encryption must fail, as confidentiality can be obtained effectively without encryption and even sometimes without the desire for confidentiality by the two communicants.' 
I know that others of my colleagues, including Senators Burns, Daschle, Ashcroft, Kerrey, and McCain, share my appreciation of importance of this encryption issue for our economy, our national security and our privacy. This is not a partisan issue. This is not a black-and-white issue of being either for law enforcement and national security or for Internet freedom. Characterizing the debate in these simplistic terms is neither productive nor accurate. 
Delays in resolving the encryption debate hurt most the very public safety and national security interests that are posed as obstacles to resolving this issue. I look forward to working with these colleagues on sensible solutions in legislation, which will not be subject to change at the whim of agency beauracrats. 
Every American, not just those in the software and high-tech industries and not just those in law enforcement agencies, has a stake in the outcome of this debate. We have a legislative stalemate right now that needs to be resolved, and I plan to work closely with my colleagues on a solution in this congressional session. 
I commend Senator Ashcroft for holding an encryption hearing last month and providing a forum to discuss the important privacy and constitutional interests at stake in the encryption debate. How we resolve this debate today will have important repercussions for the exercise of our constitutional rights tomorrow. Do you agree with me that every American, not just those in the high-tech industries and not just those in law enforcement agencies, has a stake in the outcome of this debate?

Mr. LEAHY. These constitutional issues are vital ones for Congress to consider. I understand that efforts are underway for industry stakeholders to reach some accommodation with the Administration. I encourage constructive dialogue between the Administration and industry and, in fact, have been urging a dialogue between law enforcement and industry for over a year. But Congress will continue to exercise necessary oversight to ensure that the privacy and other constitutional rights of Americans are protected.

Mr. LEAHY. In my view, encryption legislation should promote the following goals: 
First, legislation should ensure the right of Americans to choose how to protect the privacy and security of their communications and information; 
Second, legislation should bar a government-mandated key escrow encryption system; 
Third, legislation should establish both procedures and standards for access by law enforcement to decryption keys or decryption assistance for both encrypted communications and stored electronic information and only permit such access upon court order authorization, with appropriate notice and other procedural safeguards; 
Fourth, legislation should establish both procedures and standards for access by foreign governments and foreign law enforcement agencies to the plaintext of encrypted communications and stored electronic information of United States persons; 
Fifth, legislation should modify the current export regime for encryption to promote the global competitiveness of American companies; 
Sixth, legislation should not link the use of certificate authorities with key recovery agents or, in other words, link the use of encryption for confidentiality purposes with use of encryption for authenticity and integrity purposes; 
Seventh, legislation should, consistent with these goals of promoting privacy and the global competitiveness of our high-tech industries, help our law enforcement agencies and national security agencies deal with the challenges posed by the use of encryption; and 
Eighth, legislation should protect the security and privacy of information provided by Americans to the government by ensuring that encryption products used by the government interoperate with commercial encryption products. 
Do you agree with these goals?

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent shootings outside a school in Jonesboro, Arkansas, that left four young students and a teacher dead and scores of others wounded in both body and mind are shocking. Just over the last few months, we have seen deadly shootings carried out by juveniles in rural communities in Kentucky, in Mississippi and now in Arkansas. Clearly, juvenile crime is not just an urban problem. These shootings leave scars on the loved ones of those killed and injured and on the communities involved that take a long time to heal. 
We may never fully comprehend how such crimes against children could be executed by other children. But one thing should be clear: The issue of juvenile crime should not be used for cheap grandstanding or short-sighted political gain. We need to find constructive approaches to this problem that builds upon past successes and respects the proper roles of State, local and Federal authorities. 
In the last session, and again at the beginning of this session, I have spoken about the need to address the nation's juvenile crime problem on a bipartisan basis. Politicizing the juvenile crime problem does a disservice to the citizens in this country who want constructive responses. 
I have spoken about the need to address the flaws in the juvenile crime bill, S. 10, which the Judiciary Committee voted on last summer. In floor statements and in the extensive minority views included in the Committee report, I have outlined those areas in which this bill needs significant improvement. 
In short, the bill reported by the Committee to the Senate would mandate massive changes in the juvenile justice systems in each of our States, and it would invite an influx of juvenile cases in Federal courts around the country. The repercussions of this legislation would be severe for any State seeking federal juvenile justice assistance. The bill also removes core protections that have been in pace for 25 years to keep juvenile offenders out of adult jails and away from the harmful influences of seasoned adult criminals. 
The need for significant improvements to this bill is no secret. Virtually every editorial board to consider the bill has reached the same conclusion. Just in recent days, the Philadelphia Inquirer concluded that the bill `is fatally flawed and should be rejected.' On Monday, March 23, the Los Angeles Times described the bill as `peppered with ridiculous poses and penalties' and taking a `rigid, counterproductive approach.' The Chattanooga Times, on March 14, labeled the bill `misguided' with 
`flaws so far-reaching that the bill requires substantial surgery.' The Houston Chronicle, on March 10, observed that this bill `at the very least, needs serious rethinking.' The Legal Times, on March 2, called S. 10 `the crime bill no one likes.' The St. Petersburg Times, on February 23, described the bill as `an amalgam of bad and dangerous ideas.' A February 10 opinion piece in the Baltimore Sun described S. 10 as a `radical' and `aberrant bill.' 
The criticisms leveled at S. 10 are, unfortunately, well-deserved. Consequently, eight months after this bill was voted out of Committee, the Committee held a belated hearing on some of the new controversial mandates in the bill. At that hearing, on March 9, Senator Sessions announced a number of changes that he planned to make to the new juvenile record-keeping and fingerprinting mandates in the bill. I had recommended a number of these changes during Judiciary Committee mark-up of the bill, and I am pleased that, finally, my cautions are being heeded. 
I will be glad to see removed the requirement of photographing every juvenile upon arrest for an act that would have been a felony if committed by an adult, and the new fingerprinting and record-keeping mandates limited to felony acts that occur in the future. 
I continue to oppose the imposition of these new requirements as mandates. These mandates will cost States more to implement than they can hope to receive in federal assistance. Those who believe that $250 million over 5 years, or $50 million per year, will be sufficient to pay for the record-keeping mandates in S. 10 have not studied the comprehensive report recently released by the National Center for Juvenile Justice and that the bill, as currently drafted, would cost the states far more than that, especially through its new fingerprinting and record-keeping mandates. 
Many of the States are way ahead of the federal government in finding innovative ways to address juvenile crime and need resource assistance, and not bullying, from Washington. They need help to do what they decide is the right balance. 
While it is a better practice to hold hearings and examine issues before legislation is voted on and reported out of committee, I look forward to working with Senators Hatch and Sessions to improve this package, now that the bill has been reported but finds itself off the main track and stalled on a siding. I again urge the sponsors of this legislation not to politicize the important issue of juvenile crime but to work in an open, fair and bipartisan way to make S. 10 a better bill that will truly do what we all say we want it do to: Reduce youth crime.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the predicament Vermont, Maine and Texas find themselves in, simply because they are following Congress' directions. In 1985, we amended the Low-Level Nuclear Waste Policy Act to encourage states to enter into interstate compacts to develop disposal facilities for low-level waste by December, 1995, or to assume responsibility for safe waste disposal in their own states. Following our direction, Vermont began looking for an in-state depository location. The sites examined in Vermont were not suitable because of both their geology and their proximity to large populations. At about the same time, Texas offered to enter into a compact with Vermont and Maine and to use a site they were already developing for Texas waste. 
The state legislatures of Vermont, Maine and Texas agreed to enter into this compact in the early 1990s. The Compact is a contractual agreement among the three states, but it requires Congressional approval in order to allow the member states to exclude waste from outside their compact. According to our Constitution, these compacts must be approved by Congress. Article 1 clearly states that `No state shall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . Enter into any Agreement or Compact with another state, . . . .' 
Since 1985, nine interstate low-level waste compacts have been approved by Congress, encompassing forty-one states. They were ratified without change and without a single recorded negative vote. I am pleased to see that the Vermont, Maine and Texas Compact will follow in that tradition. 
I first introduced legislation to approve our Compact in the 103rd Congress. Passage of H.R. 629 finally ratifies the clear will of the Vermont Legislature when it entered in the Compact. At that time, I believe we all recognized that there was no perfect solution for dealing with low-level nuclear waste, but as long as we are generating power from nuclear facilities and as long as our research universities, hospitals and laboratories use nuclear materials, we are going to have to dispose of the waste. We cannot continue to ignore the need to safely store nuclear waste. To pretend otherwise would be to ignore the growing environmental problem of storing this waste at inadequate, temporary sites in Vermont, Maine and Texas. 
Instead, we need to make a commitment to developing and building the safest facility for long-term storage of waste. That is what our States have done, and Congress should not stand in their way. I have talked with our Vermont state geologist. We have looked at maps of Vermont and we have looked at our geology, hydrology and meteorology in Vermont. There is only one conclusion from all of these discussions: there is not an acceptable site for nuclear waste storage in our state. 
The Compact also makes economic sense. The residents of Vermont have already committed themselves to this Compact, and the twenty-five million dollar price tag that goes along with it. Since Vermont generates such a small amount of waste, it would be economically unfeasible to build a facility that would meet all the environmental requirements and only store waste generated in Vermont. Building such a facility would put Vermont in a position of looking to other states to help support the facility. 
It is also important to remember that under the Compact, Texas has agreed to host the waste facility, but it does not name a specific site. That is an issue to be decided by the people of Texas, as it should be. This Compact also allows the states of Vermont, Maine and Texas to refuse waste from other states. Specifically, Texas will be able to limit the amount of low-level waste coming into its facility from out-of-state sources. Maine and Vermont together produce a fraction of what is generated in Texas, but by entering into this Compact, our states will share the cost of building the facility. 
Finally, building the facility does not end Vermont's obligation to the safety of this site. We have a long-term commitment to the site, from ensuring that the facility meets all of the federal construction and operating regulations, to making sure the waste is transported properly to the site, and to ensuring that the surrounding area is rigorously monitored. Vermont will not send its waste to Texas and then close it eyes to the rest of the process.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1994, I authored the first law to provide specific protection against `clone' telephones. While the main focus of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, was to help our law enforcement agencies deal with the challenge of new digital telecommunications equipment and services, the law also contained important bans on the use and trafficking of clone phones, scanning receivers, and hardware and software used to steal cellular service. 
Specifically, in CALEA, we amended the Counterfeit Access Device law, 18 U.S.C. 1029, by adding a provision to criminalize the use and possession, with intent to defraud, of altered telecommunications instruments, or scanning receivers, hardware or software, to obtain unauthorized access to telecommunications services. This law also added to the federal criminal code a definition of scanning receivers to mean devices used to intercept illegally wire or electronic communications. 
`Clone' telephones are used illegally to allow free riding on the cellular phone system and result in theft of that service. The cellular telephone industry estimates that it loses $650 million per year due to clone phones. I recall testimony at hearings I chaired jointly with Representative Don Edwards on CALEA about the need to address this problem in CALEA. Tom Wheeler, President of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, testified in 1994 about:  
. . . people being surprised by `humongous' cellular bills because somebody had snatched their electronic code out of the air, cloned that into another phone, and was charging phone calls to Colombia or wherever onto their phone. 
S. Hrg. 103-1022, at p. 148 (August 11, 1994). 
In short, the theft of cellular telephone services amounts to millions of dollars of losses to wireless service providers and to consumers. 
Just as disturbing, clone phones are used by drug dealers and other criminals trying to evade police surveillance of their phone conversations. The fraudulent use of electronic serial numbers, which are critical in identifying the cellular phone subject to wiretap orders, represented a real threat to privacy. Mr. Wheeler explained in 1994, `If you have a situation where there is floating around out there multiple users of the same electronic serial numbers, you don't know who you are tapping.' S. Hrg. 103-1022, at p. 148 (August 11, 1994). 
Given the financial losses and the threats to privacy posed by clone phones, I urge the cellular telephone industry to consider the technical means available to better protect cellular phone service. In particular, if strong encryption were used to encrypt the radio waves transmitted from cellular phones to the nearest cell tower, stealing those signals for use in a clone phone would be much more difficult, if not impossible. 
I have long been a proponent of more widespread use of strong encryption. Clone phones are a perfect example of where the use of strong encryption would be far more effective to prevent this crime from occurring than all the criminal laws we could consider passing. 
This bill, as modified by the House, builds upon the work we accomplished in CALEA. 
Current law contains an `intent to defraud' requirement that has apparently posed a stumbling block for law enforcement to crack down on the cloning of cellular phones. This bill would remove this intent requirement and make it illegal to use, sell or possess hardware or software knowing it has been configured for the purpose of altering a telephone to steal service. 
The House of Representatives made a number of significant improvements to S. 493 to ensure that, upon removal of the `intent to defraud' requirement, the bill did not sweep too broadly. Indeed, I understand that even some cellular companies were concerned that the original bill introduced by Senator Kyl might inadvertently have applied to machinery used by legitimate companies to test or reprogram their equipment. 
Removal of the `intent to defraud' scienter requirement may still pose problems for those legitimate companies that with to offer `extension' telephones for cellular telephones. In fact, the Federal Communications Commission has a proceeding underway to determine whether companies may be allowed to alter the electronic serial number of a cellular telephone to allow more than one phone to have the same contact number. 
Passage of this law may be interpreted as prejudging the outcome of that proceeding by making illegal the use of clone phones, even by legitimate subscribers who pay their bills. That would be regrettable. This bill should not affect the outcome of the FCC proceeding, since the public interest may be well served by allowing competition into the extension cellular telephone business. Depending on the outcome of the FCC proceeding, we may be revisiting this legislation. 
This bill, as modified by the House, is supported by the FBI, Secret Service and the Cellular Telephone Industry Association (CTIA). We made important progress in this area when we passed CALEA, and I am glad to support legislation that will further help law enforcement combat cellular telephone fraud by those who steal cellular service.

Mr. LEAHY. 
Mr. President, it is time for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use the latest technology to deliver better service to the American people. Our nation's taxpayers deserve no less. 
Today, Senator Ashcroft and I are introducing the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act of 1998. I am pleased that Senator Reid and Senator Wyden are original cosponsors of our bill. 
Our bipartisan legislation requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with speedy access to tax forms, publications, regulations, and rulings via the Internet. It also authorizes the Treasury Department, with input from the public, to develop more online services to help taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I want to praise the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley for their leadership in moving the IRS reform legislation to the full Senate. I strongly support the bill approved by the Finance Committee last night. 
As the Senate prepares to debate IRS reforms, we must use technology to make the IRS more effective for all taxpayers. What better way to do that then to require the IRS to maintain online access to the latest tax information. Every citizen in the United States, no matter if he or she lives in a small town or big city, should be able to receive electronically the latest tax ruling or download the most up-to-date tax form. 
The IRS web page at > http://irs.ustreas.gov < provides timely service to taxpayers by increasing electronic access to some tax forms and publications. I commend the IRS for its use of Internet technology to improve its services. More information and services should be offered online and not just as a passing fad. Our legislation is needed to build on this electronic start and lock into the law for today and tomorrow comprehensive online taxpayer services. 
Our bipartisan bill protects the privacy of taxpayers by amending the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which already calls for the deletion of identifying details to prevent an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. For more than 30 years, the FOIA has served the nation well in maintaining the right of Americans to know what their government is doing--or not doing--while protecting personal privacy. Our legislation does not give new access to private tax information, but merely provides a new, easier method of receiving public tax information. 
Under the FOIA, the IRS must maintain public access to Treasury Regulations, Internal Revenue Manuals, Internal Revenue Bulletins, Revenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures, IRS Notices, IRS Announcements, General Counsel Memorandum and other taxpayer guidance. Under our legislation, the IRS must post this public tax information on the Internet in a searchable database, giving all taxpayers quick access to it. In addition, our bipartisan bill requires the IRS to post on its web site all Tax Forms, Instructions and Publications, the most essential information for the average taxpayer. 
To keep any administrative burden and taxpayer cost to a minimum, our legislation limits the Internet posting of past tax information. For information available under the FOIA, our legislation requires online posting of documents created on or after November 1, 1996, the same date electronic access is required under the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996. I am proud to have been the chief Senate sponsor of that new law enacted in the last Congress. 
For Tax Forms, Instructions and Publications, our legislation provides for online posting of documents created during the most recent five years, the same period of time that the IRS now keeps these documents on CD-ROM for Congressional offices. 
With these common sense requirements, the IRS will be able to enhance its web page with comprehensive tax guidance in a matter of days at little cost to taxpayers under our bipartisan bill. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has scored our legislation as adding no new direct spending. 
We strongly believe that the IRS must prepare itself for the next millennium now. That is why our legislation authorizes the Treasury Department to study and report back to the American people on online access to taxpayer information, the protection of online taxpayer privacy rights, the security of online taxpayer services and public comments on online taxpayer services. 
Thomas Jefferson observed that, `Information is the currency of democracy.' Let's harness the power of the information age to make the IRS a truly democratic institution, open to all our citizens all the time. 
I thank Senator Ashcroft for his support and I look forward to working with him on other high technology issues to help the Internet reach its full potential such as encryption legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act of 1998.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has spent the last twenty four years of his life working to ensure that Vermonters who are struggling to make ends meet, can afford to keep a roof over their heads. Richard Williams is far too humble to ask for recognition for those years of service, but that service has meant too much to go unrecognized. 
The Vermont State Housing Authority (VSHA) was the first statewide housing authority in the United States, and Richard has been with it almost from the beginning. He came to VSHA in 1974 as an accountant when the organization itself was only six years old. Through the years he has served as Director of Fiscal Management, Deputy Director, and since 1984, Executive Director. 
Under his leadership, VSHA has grown considerably. Today it administers the Section 8 program providing 4,585 families with rental assistance. The organization's non-profit arm, The Housing Foundation Inc. (HFI), which Richard helped to establish, created additional units of affordable housing and mobile home park lots. Through the HFI and various partnerships 1,050 units of affordable housing are now available for low-income families in Vermont. Just recently, Richard oversaw a creative interpretation of the tax code which, with the help of the Howard Bank, produced an $8.1 million tax exempt bond to refinance most of the mobile home parks in The Housing Foundation portfolio, to the benefit of 565 Vermont households. 
But Richard was never content to limit himself to the work of VSHA. He sits on more boards and has served in more associations than I could recount here today. Among them are the Governor's Housing Council, the Advisory Group for the Consolidated Plan, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Committee. With all of these commitments, it amazes me that he gets any rest at all. Vermonters are fortunate indeed to have someone so dedicated to making housing affordable for all, and who apparently needs so little sleep. 
This year, the Vermont State Housing Authority is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary, and that is indeed cause for celebration. I applaud VSHA for thirty years of outstanding service to Vermont, and at the same time recognize Richard Williams for the large part he has played in that success. I know I speak for thousands of Vermonters who have a roof over their heads today because of his efforts, in saying thank you to Richard for twenty four years of service to Vermont.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to applaud the distinguished Senator from Washington State. Senator Murray has stated the reasons why the Senate voted the right way on Margaret McKeown and on Ed Shea. I would also note for the record that the Senator from Washington has been extraordinarily diligent in working very hard for these two highly qualified nominees. I know the frustration she has felt with the delay, especially on Margaret McKeown and with so many vacancies on the Ninth Circuit and given that this has been 2 years--in fact, 2 years this Sunday. 
This delay is the result of a process that has become a little bit crazy. I commend the distinguished Senator, and I thank her for her help on this. I think it would have been impossible for us to be here for this vote without her help, and I applaud her for that.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me speak a little bit about Margaret McKeown. She was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee on a vote of 16 to 2. She has the support of Chairman Hatch, a number of Republican Senators, is supported by both Senators from her State. Why this was held up for 2 years, I cannot understand. And then she is confirmed 80 to 11. How many of us have ever won an election with those kinds of percentages? Yet, apparently somebody held her up for 2 years because she was supposed to be controversial. How controversial is 80 to 11? Those are pretty good numbers. Perhaps her secret critics will explain their views, the reason she has been held up for 2 years. 
I have been urging action on judicial nominees for many months. This week, faced with 5 continuing vacancies on a 13-member court, Chief Judge Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified a `judicial emergency' and took the unprecedented step of authorizing panels including only one Second Circuit judge and two visiting judges. In addition he has had to cancel hearings. 
The Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit, but that nomination continues to sit on the Senate calendar. This is another woman who has sat here and had to wait and wait and wait, while the Senate holds her up. Her nomination was received back in June 1997. She was finally favorably reported by a committee vote of 16 to 2--pretty good odds. She is strongly supported by both New York Senators, one Republican, one Democrat. But the nomination continues to languish without consideration. And three more Second Circuit nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee, 
and await their confirmation hearings. 
I mention the Second Circuit because that is my Circuit. It is the Circuit to which my State resides. I have been urging action on the nominees for this Circuit for many months. The Senate is failing in its obligations to the people of the Second Circuit--to the people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end to this stall and take action. We should consider the nomination of Judge Sotomayor. We should do it today. We should hold hearings on the three other Second Circuit nominees next week and confirm them before the upcoming recess. Our delay is inflicting harm and giving proof to the warning that the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court gave in his 1997 Year End Report that continuing vacancies would harm the administration of justice. I urge the Republican leadership to proceed now. 
Earlier this week, the distinguished majority leader indicated that he feels he has proceeded too quickly with respect to judicial nominations. I strongly disagree. No reference to the number of judges the Senate has begrudgingly confirmed over the past 2 years excuses the delay on any of the nominees pending on the Senate Calendar. There is no excuse or justification for the judicial emergency the Senate is inflicting on the Second Circuit. 
The distinguished majority leader says there is no clamor for Federal judges. I recognize that there are no vacancies on the Federal bench in Mississippi, but there are numerous, longstanding vacancies in other places, vacancies that are harming the Federal administration of justice. 
The people and businesses in the Second Circuit and other circuits and districts need additional Federal judges. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the almost 80 vacancies that need to be filled, the Congress authorize an additional 55 judgeships throughout the country, as set forth in S.678, the Federal Judgeship Act that I introduced last year. 
Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the judicial nominees pending before us? I hope not. 
We are sworn to uphold the Constitution, we are sworn to uphold the laws, and we are paid pretty well to do that. We are failing our oath and we are failing the job the taxpayers of this country pay us to do.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted to see the Senate confirm Ed Shea as a Federal District Judge. I attended his confirmation hearing back on February 4 and found him to be all that his supporters and friends had said he would be. I know that he has the support of the Senators from the State of Washington. He also has the strong support of this Senator from Vermont. Ed Shea was nominated last September for a vacancy that occurred in 1996, over 15 months ago. Mr. Shea was reported by the Judiciary Committee without dissent and without objection. He was rated qualified for this position by the American Bar Association. I spoke of his nomination last week and am now delighted to see this nomination considered by the Senate. 
With this confirmation the Senate will have acted favorably on only 14 nominees this year. I am glad that Margaret McKeown is luck number 13 and Ed Shea is number 14, but remain concerned for the other nominees who have been unlucky and remain stalled on the Senate calendar. 
I have tried to bring to the attention of the Republican leadership the need to consider and confirm the two judicial nominees for District Courts in Illinois who have been languishing on the Senate calendar without action for the last five months. 
It is time for the Senate to consider the nominations of Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported these two nominations to the full Senate on November 6, 1997. Their confirmation are desperately needed to help end the vacancy crisis in the District Courts of Illinois. 
Pat Murphy is an outstanding judicial nominee. He has practiced law in the State of Illinois for 20 years as a trial lawyer and tried about 250 cases to verdict or judgment as sole counsel. During his legal career, Mr. Murphy has made an extensive commitment to pro bono service--dedicating approximately 20 percent of his working time to representing disadvantaged clients in his community. For instance, Pat Murphy has served as the court-appointed guardian to a disabled minor since 1990, without taking any fee for his services. The American Bar Association recognized this extensive legal experience when it rated him as qualified for this nomination. Mr. Murphy also served his country with distinction as a Marine during the Vietnam War. 
Judge Michael McCuskey is also an outstanding judicial nominee. Judge McCuskey served as a Public Defender for Marshall County in Lacon, IL from 1976 to 1988. In 1988, he left the Public Defender's office and the law firm, Pace, McCuskey and Galley to sit on the bench in the 10th Judicial Circuit in Peoria, IL. He has served as a judge of the Third District Appellate Court of Illinois since his election in 1990. 
The American Bar Association recognized his stellar qualifications by giving Judge McCuskey its highest rating of well-qualified for this nomination. 
The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are growing more critical by the day. This is especially true in the Central and Southern District Courts of Illinois, where these outstanding nominees will serve once they are confirmed. Indeed, in the Southern District of Illinois, where Pat Murphy will serve if his nomination is ever voted on by the full Senate, Chief Judge Gilbert has reported that his docket has been so burdened with criminal cases that he went for a year without having a hearing in a civil case. In 1996, 88 percent of the cases filed in all federal trial courts were civil, while 12 percent were criminal. But in the Southern District of Illinois, not one of those civil cases was heard by Chief Judge Gilbert. 
The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' There is no excuse for the Senate's delay in considering these two fine nominees for Districts with judicial emergency vacancies. 
I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to have the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfil its constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. 
I hope that the Majority Leader will soon set a date certain to consider the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. 
These nominees may well be a case in which a secret hold by one Senator is delaying Senate action. I recall receiving a Dear Colleague letter from the Majority Leader in January 1997, the first day of this Congress. In that letter he proposed to address the frustrations with the hold system and what he termed `a correction.' The letter goes on to describe the hold as `a request for notification of or protection on an unanimous consent request or proposed time agreement.' The Majority Leader advised a Senator placing a hold `should understand that he . . . may have to come to the floor to express his objection after being notified of the intention to move the matter to which he objects.' 
I also recall last summer when the nomination of Joel Klein to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division was a source of some controversy. I recall then that the Majority Leader proceeded to consideration of that nomination and allowed opponents to debate their concerns and the Senate was able to proceed to a vote and to Mr. Klein's confirmation. 
I hope that model will be utilized without further delay in connection with the Murphy and McCuskey nominations. These nominees are strongly supported by their home State Senators. Any Senator outside those Districts who wishes to oppose, speak against or vote no for any reason or no reason is free to do so. What we need to find a way to overcome is the veto of these nominations by a single Senator when a majority of the United States Senate is prepared to confirm them. 
We are falling farther and farther behind the pace the Senate established in the last nine weeks of last year. When the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in his 1997 Year End Report that `some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a . . . final floor vote' he could have been referring to Patrick Murphy, Judge Michael McCuskey, Margaret McKeown and Judge Sonia Sotomayor. 
Nine months should be more than a sufficient time for the Senate to complete its review of these nominees. During the four years of the Bush Administration, only three confirmations took as long as nine months. Last year, 10 of the 36 judges confirmed took nine months or more and many took as long as a year and one-half. So far this year, Judge Ann Aiken, Judge Margaret Morrow, and Judge Hilda Tagle have taken 21 months, 26 months and 31 months respectively. Margaret McKeown's nomination has already been pending for 24 months. Judge Sotomayor's nomination has already been pending for 9 months. Pat Murphy's and Judge McCuskey's nominations have already been pending for 8 months. The average number of days to consider nominees used to be between 50 and 90, it rose last year to over 200 and this year stands at over 300 days from nomination to confirmation. That is too long and does a disservice to our Federal Courts. 
I urge the Republican leadership to proceed to consideration of each of the judicial nominees pending on the Senate calendar without further delay.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every week I wonder just what new step the special prosecutor, Mr. Starr, will find himself carrying out, and each week it seems he does not disappoint. 
One week, we will recall, a citizen had the temerity to ask why Prosecutor Starr was using the results of an illegal wiretap, something that had been reported in the press that, without a doubt, he was using an illegal--illegal--wiretap. This citizen had the audacity to question Mr. Starr. Of course, he got slapped with a subpoena, had to spend as much money on a lawyer as he saved for a year's college tuition for one of his children and was brought into the star chamber, the grand jury, and had to say why he dared question the man behind the curtain. 
This was probably as outrageous an abuse of prosecutorial discretion as anything I have seen in a while, but unlike prosecutors who are elected or Senators who are elected or people who are elected, Mr. Starr, the Republican prosecutor, does not have to respond to anybody, and he has an unlimited budget. He sent a very clear signal: `If you dare question my use of illegal tactics, I'll stop you from questioning me, I'll make you spend so much money that you can't do it.' And, of course, he has an unlimited amount of money himself so he can do that. 
He then topped that outrageous activity by bringing Monica Lewinsky's mother before him and for day after day grilled her on things that her daughter may have told her in confidence. So he set the precedent that a prosecutor will have a mother in there for something that has nothing to do with violent crime or crime against the country or anything else and say, `You have to tell us what your daughter told you.' If your daughter dares to confide in you, if your child dares to come to a parent and ask advice or confide in a parent, then Prosecutor Starr will want to know what you said to your parent. This is in between giving paid speeches to groups to talk about family values. 
I was outraged as were many others. I have introduced a measure to lead to our reviewing the law on this point. On March 6, I introduced S.1721 to develop Federal prosecutorial guidelines to protect familial privacy and parent-child communications in matters that do not involve allegations of violent conduct or drug trafficking. In addition, the legislation would direct the Judicial Conference to undertake a study and then report whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended explicitly to recognize a parent-child privilege. 
Then what was this week's latest outrage? As I said, I keep wondering how he is going to top himself. He did this time by going to a bookstore and saying I want to know what books somebody was buying and reading. Now, the bookstore knows that this is an outrageous request, and the bookstore knows that people ought to be able to come into a bookstore, read anything they want, look at anything they want, buy anything they want without having Prosecutor Starr and his henchmen come right in behind them and see what they read. 
The bookstore had it made very clear to them by Prosecutor Starr and his henchmen that `If you want to fight this, you are going to have to sell one heck of a lot of books to pay the lawyers. You probably won't sell enough books this year to pay what we will cost you for defending the rights of your customers.' 
Prosecutor Starr doesn't have to worry because he has already spent $40 million of what we, the taxpayers, have given him, with no end in sight. So he can tell that bookstore, `Go ahead, make my day, you go on in and try to fight this. I'll bankrupt you. I'll just grind you down into the ground.' 
So now there is this idea, Mr. President, that everyone has to think if they go into a bookstore, `Am I going to have a subpoena in there to see what I read or don't read?' 
I remember when Judge Bork was before the U.S. Senate for confirmation. Somebody came into the Senate Judiciary Committee and said, `We have a list of what Robert Bork has been renting from video stores.' I was so incensed that anybody would do that, I 
introduced legislation to make it illegal to give out the lists of what people rented in a video store. To make it bipartisan, my good friend Alan Simpson, the distinguished Republican whip and a conservative Republican, joined me on that, and we passed the Leahy-Simpson bill. What we said in the Leahy-Simpson bill is that it is nobody's business what you rent for videos, and I think the American people agreed with us. 
The difference is we had Democrats standing up for the rights of a Republican nominee in that instance and all Americans. Now, of course, we have a Republican prosecutor who says it doesn't make any difference to him, `I want to know what you are reading.' Are we going to start with people following us through a video store now and say, `Well, we can't tell you what he rented, but we know he glanced over at one of the R-rated videos.' 
Or are they going to follow us into the library and say, `He read Chaucer's `Canterbury Tales,' and you know what they say.' Actually most people don't, because they never bothered to read it in an English class--but they think something unseemly may be in there. 
Or, `He read `Catcher in the Rye.' Woo-wee, there is going to be a field day. 
If Prosecutor Starr followed me through a bookstore, he is going to find me reading everything from `Angela's Ashes' to `Batman.' He can have a lot of fun with this. `Angela's Ashes' talks about Frank McCourt going into the library and reading dictionaries, where he looked up words that his parents wouldn't tell him the meaning of. Of course, `Batman' is a guy who runs around in a suit with a mask on. Now, that is going to kind of raise some questions. 
What about the person who goes into a magazine store to buy Time or Newsweek magazine, but they may have slowed down by the magazines that had pictures of unclothed people or certain sports magazines with their swimsuit editions? 
Or what about this--here is something for Prosecutor Starr to look at--check the person who has an average income who goes into the magazine store and picks up the magazine with expensive sports cars that they couldn't possibly afford. They are reading about Ferraris, Maseratis and Porsches. Maybe we better subpoena that person's bank accounts; maybe we better check him out. Why would they be reading about a Maserati and a Ferrari if they only make $40,000 a year? Something is going on here. 
New Englanders have asked during witch hunts whether there is any sense of decency. Let's get a grip. 
If, as Mr. Starr has indicated in his activities with the Paula Jones attorneys and with other groups, that he wants to get rid of the President of the United States who was elected twice--fine, let him just come forward and say so. Just say, `Look, I want him out of office; I will do anything possible to get him out of office,' and maybe people will understand. But let us at least realize the damaging precedents that are being set. 
Are we going to have thought control? Are we really going to go to the point where we ask people what they read, what they see? Are we going to next ask, `Well, what newspapers do you read?' It is not enough to ask what newspaper do you read, `What sections of the newspaper do you read? I mean, do you read the sports section or the business section? Do you read the comic page or the gossip page? Do you read the front page or the obituaries, and why those obituaries, what were you looking for?' 
We Americans have a sense of privacy. We ought to be able to read anything we want. We ought to be able to look at what we want. We shouldn't have to worry that a prosecutor is going to come in and, basically, threaten a bookstore with bankruptcy if they don't tell you what their customers read or buy. 
Just as Senator Simpson and I passed a law so people couldn't ask Judge Bork or any other nominee what videos they rent, we ought to be protecting what people read. This is America. This is not some totalitarian, thought-controlled country. 
So let us have a sense of right and wrong. Frankly, this 
Vermonter finds the idea of asking bookstores what books their patrons read or buy, wrong. I find it chilling, I find it frightening, and I hope that the press and everybody else will consider it. I hope they will, because if they can ask what books you read, they can ask what newspapers you read, what television news programs you watch or radio stations you listen to. It is all one in the same. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are about to complete action on the supplemental appropriation for the International Monetary Fund. I want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, and Senator Hagel, who have worked hard to reach agreement on compromise IMF language that the Treasury Department can support. 
The amendment we are about to vote on provides the full amount requested by the President for the IMF, including $3.4 billion for the New Arrangements to Borrow, and $14.5 billion for the quota increase. None of this money costs the U.S. Treasury. It is repaid with interest. In the event of a default, it is backed up by IMF gold reserves. 
This amendment is not perfect. Few are. It does not directly address certain issues I am concerned about, including workers' rights, military spending, and the environment. Neither the IMF nor the Treasury Department have worked aggressively enough to ensure that IMF loans do not promote exploitation of workers, subsidize excessive military spending, or result in environmental harm. I would have strongly preferred conditional language on those issues similar to the economic and trade conditions that are in the bill. However, that was explicitly rejected by the Republican side. I am encouraged, however, that language on these issues is included in the House bill, and will be discussed in the conference. I also want to credit Senator Wellstone, whose amendment addresses these concerns. 
I should also mention that the McConnell-Hagel amendment does require further progress on information disclosure by the IMF, an area that I have worked on for many years as it relates to all the international financial institutions. The World Bank has made considerable progress on this, but the IMF has lagged behind. In some instances there are legitimate reasons for protecting the confidentiality of IMF documents. But the presumption should favor disclosure. Secretary Rubin has indicated that he intends to press the IMF harder to expand public access to IMF documents. That should be a priority, because that is how we will ultimately deal most effectively with the other types of concerns I have mentioned. A process that is open to public scrutiny tends to result in better decisions. 
Mr. President, the IMF has a reputation for being an arrogant, secretive organization that has too often bailed out corrupt governments. There is some truth to that. But I am also convinced that as the world's leading economic power the United States has a multitude of interests in a strong IMF. Millions of American jobs depend on exports. The IMF plays an important role in limiting the adverse impact of major financial crises. This amendment, for the first time that I am aware of, seeks to address some of the concerns that the IMF has been too eager to bail out corrupt governments, or governments whose trade policies have discriminated against American companies. Given the difficulty the Treasury Department encountered in getting this IMF funding passed in a form that Treasury could accept, it is clear that unless the IMF follows through on the reforms the Congress is insisting on US support for the IMF will soon evaporate. 
Finally, I want to mention one other issue that has concerned me for some time, and which has also been a problem at the World Bank and the other international financial institutions. That is the lack of significant numbers of women in IMF managerial positions, and the lack of adequate grievance procedures to effectively respond to cases of harassment, retaliation, and gender discrimination. The IMF is particularly at fault in these areas. The statistics show that women have been systematically denied advancement at the IMF. The grievance process, while perhaps measuring up to a standard of years gone by, today fails to afford the due process that is necessary to deter abuse of power, particularly at an institution that is immune from the court system. This is an urgent problem which affects morale and the quality of IMF operations, and should be treated as a priority by IMF management as well as the Treasury Department. The Appropriations Committee first called attention to the problem of gender discrimination at the IMF in 1992, and there has been far too little progress since then. 
Having said that, I will support this compromise and want to again thank Chairman McConnell and Senator Hagel for the considerable time and effort they gave to finding an agreement that a majority of senators could accept. 
Madam President, the IMF funding has been attached to S. 1768, the Bosnia, Iraq and Domestic Disaster Relief supplemental bill, because a majority of senators believe, as Senator Stevens, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee has urged, that the IMF funding should be sent to the President on whichever supplemental bill the Congress completes action on first. We have agreed that if the House sends us a separate IMF supplemental bill we can choose to go to conference on that. But there is no requirement that we do so. Our primary concern is that the Congress complete action on the IMF as soon as possible and send it to the President for signature.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on February 26, 1998, the White House announced that it had certified Mexico as a partner in combating international drug trafficking, stating that the Mexican government was `fully cooperating' in the war on drugs. However, in stark contrast to this claim, an assessment by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) prepared in January and obtained by the New York Times states that, `the Government of Mexico has not accomplished its counter narcotics goals or succeeded in cooperation with the United States Government * * * The scope of Mexican drug trafficking has increased significantly along with the attendant violence.' 
I believe the yearly certification process is a misguided way to deal with the international drug problem. It applies a black and white standard to a complex problem that, more than anything else, is caused by the seemingly insatiable demand for drugs here in our own country. I am encouraged by Senator Dodd's efforts and of other senators to pursue a new approach. I want to support that effort. In addition to bipartisan criticism in the Congress, foreign officials have called the certification process demeaning and ineffectual. However, until that process is changed--and I hope it is--it remains U.S. law and the administration is bound to implement it in good faith. 
There are examples of cooperation by the Mexican Government in reducing narcotics trafficking. Opponents of this resolution have mentioned several ways in which the Mexican Government has made progress. The administration reports increases in drug seizures, improved anti-narcotics intelligence, and implementation of new laws on money laundering, asset forfeiture, electronic surveillance and witness protection. Yet drug-related violence and corruption at the highest levels of the Mexican anti-narcotics police continues unabated--affecting every aspect of life and every level of society in Mexico and spilling over the border into the United States. We also receive persistent reports of human rights abuses by Mexican security forces. 
I have a great deal of respect for General Barry McCaffrey. He has taken on the immense job of directing our drug control program with enthusiasm and boundless energy and the best of intentions. I particularly support the efforts he has made to emphasize the importance of drug prevention and treatment. However, I have to respectfully disagree with his assessment of the cooperation between the United States and Mexico as `absolutely superlative.' 
According to a February 26, 1998, article in the New York Times the DEA reports that none of the changes by and to Mexican law enforcement institutions `have resulted in the arrest of the leadership or the dismantlement of any of the well-known organized criminal groups operating out of Mexico.' In addition, no Mexican national was extradited to the United States to face drug charges, and the corruption of Mexican law-enforcement officials, judges, and government employees continues to frustrate United States efforts to build cases and apprehend drug traffickers. Mr. President, if the administration deems this to be `superlative' cooperation, I am concerned. And that is why I will support the resolution to decertify Mexico. I do not believe that a faithful interpretation of the law can lead to any other conclusion than that the Mexican Government has failed to fully cooperate with United States drug control efforts. 
Mr. President, I support this resolution reluctantly. It is very important that we continue to work with the Mexican Government in the fight against drug trafficking. I applaud the May 1997 Declaration of the United States-Mexico Alliance Against Drugs, signed by President Clinton and President Zedillo, and the ongoing collaborative efforts between American and Mexican law enforcement officers. I do not minimize the efforts the Mexican Government is making. However, it falls far short of full cooperation. And while I am mindful that decertification could strain relations between our two nations, that is not a justification for interpreting the law in a manner that is not supported by the facts. I am hopeful that Mexico will not view this decision as a condemnation of its counter-narcotics efforts, but as a challenge to work more closely with the United States to improve them.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Snowe and my other Colleagues from the Northeast in thanking Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for agreeing to include emergency Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding in the disaster supplemental. This funding is desperately needed to assist in recovery in areas where there are significant gaps in existing disaster programs. 
On January 9, the Northeast was hit by an ice storm of an unprecedented scale. The storm downed trees and power lines throughout the northeast. In Vermont, one power company alone replaced more than 50 miles of power lines and 200 power poles. Crews came from as far away as Hawaii to aid in the effort to restore power to the 10,000 people left without electricity for up to 11 days during what is traditionally one of the coldest months of the year. Damage to Vermont utilities was extensive in the six counties declared disaster areas, with storm damage totaling over $9 million. Of that, only $552,648 was covered by FEMA. 
The storm was unique in the type of damage it inflicted--buildings, roads, and water and sewer systems were left largely untouched, but electric utility lines and trees were wiped out completely in some areas and suffered significant damage throughout the region. This is not the kind of damage traditional disaster programs were designed to address, as the `Blueprint for Action' report FEMA produced after the storm makes clear. According to that report `the single most critical concern is the loss of electric power caused by the storm.' 
The Community Development Block Grant program is designed to provide flexible funding to promote economic development. That is exactly the kind of assistance needed to repair the damage to the power infrastructure in the Northeast. The most serious concern raised by the damage to the utility system is the cost it will impose on all Vermont rate payers. At 11.29 cents per kilowatt hour, utility rates in New England are already 64% higher than the national average. This increased cost of doing business is a significant hurdle to attracting and keeping businesses in Vermont. The cost of the storm damage is expected to force some utility companies to seek further increases in electric rates. Any increase would be a serious blow to economic development throughout the region. 
The need for Federal assistance to recover from the ice storm is not the result of poor planning on the part of the utilities. All of the affected utilities built average annual storm damage costs into their rate structure. However, the cost of this one storm was so extraordinarily high, that it dwarfed those set-asides. One company is facing damage from this one storm equal to eight times its annual budget for emergency repairs. This is not a cost that these companies can just absorb. 
The need for emergency CDBG funding is clear. I strongly support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

Mr. LEAHY. I tell my friend, the Presiding Officer, if I could have the attention of the Presiding Officer, I will not give a great speech but a small speech. 
Mr. President, just a few weeks after we pushed the U.N. Security Council to support strong resolutions against Iraq, we are on the amendment by the distinguished senior Senator from North Carolina proposing ways to further undercut the effectiveness of the United Nations and our leadership in the United Nations. In regular U.N. peacekeeping operations, blue helmet operations, we sought reimbursement for our in-kind contributions, and we are reimbursed today. But there are many other U.N. operations that have the blessings of the Security Council but are not actually U.N. peacekeeping operations, including U.N. troops that were included because it was important to the United States interests. 
I will give you an example. Operation Provide Comfort in northern Iraq is an example. The United Nations has given its blessing because we, the United States, asked the United Nations to support it. But it is, above all else, as we all know, a U.S. operation. 
There are other examples where we pushed for a U.N. Security Council resolution in support of our position to give a broader degree of support. But if the United Nations were to adopt all of these operations as its own, I expect that the Senator from North Carolina would probably be the first to object. I doubt he would want our troops to be wearing blue helmets in those operations. 
As Senator Biden has said, maybe we should seek to change 
 the U.N. charter so all activities blessed by the Security Council require reimbursement. But do we really want to have to pay for everything the Security Council decides? I doubt it. Other nations undertake operations after receiving the blessings of a U.N. Security Council resolution. We may support that. But we don't want to participate in it and we don't want to pay for it. 
It is easy to take a shot at the United Nations. It is a little bit more difficult to make it work. I remind Senators that just last year many in the leadership of the House and the Senate, the majority leadership in the House and the Senate, promised, along with the President of the United States, that we would pay our arrearage in dues to the United Nations. But then in what was probably the most irresponsible foreign policy action I have seen in 23 years here, the most irresponsible actions on the very day that the United States was before the U.N. Security Council begging the U.N. Security Council to back us in Iraq, the leadership in the House of Representatives broke their commitment and killed the appropriations for the payment of dues to the United Nations. 
If we want to get out of the United Nations, then let us vote to do that. If we want to say we will never spend another cent in the United Nations, let us vote to do that. But to first give our word that we will pay what we contractually owe and then on the day when we desperately are pushing the United Nations to back us in Iraq, to say we break our word, we can't do that. 
I see the Senator from Minnesota is ready. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from the Great Lakes State today to offer an amendment that clarifies an issue that relates to ecological research involving Lake Champlain and its relatives, the Great Lakes of the Midwest. 
Almost 10 years ago, I embarked on a campaign to reverse what was the appearance of initial environmental degradation of Lake Champlain. This campaign included access to the research and expertise of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Sea Grant Program. 
When I included Lake Champlain within the definition of the `Great Lakes' for the purpose, and solely for the purpose, of the National Sea Grant Program, that change ignited some regional anxiety in the Midwest, the traditional home of the five Great Lakes. It sparked a geography debate over the last month that has enlightened many a classroom. It certainly enlivened the conversation across many a dinner table, including my own in Middlesex, VT. But it has had the added advantage of even classes that did a poor job of teaching geography now had something with which they could do a good job, and people now know at least where the top northern tier of States are. 
My original amendment only modified the term `Great Lakes' for the purpose of the National Sea Grant Program. But it snowballed into concerns that we would have to rewrite our encyclopedias or throw out our atlases. My amendment to the National Sea Grant Program simply allows Vermont colleges that border Lake Champlain to compete for Sea Grant College status and research funds. 
Although Vermonters, I must admit to my good friends from the Midwest, and New Englanders have always thought of Lake Champlain as the `sixth Great Lake,' because it is the sixth largest body of fresh water in the continental United States, I recognize the historical and emotional significance this definition carries in much of the Midwest where they have the fantastic Great Lakes--Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior. That is why I have been working with my colleagues of the Midwest to ensure their image of the Great Lakes remains intact, while allowing schools in Vermont to compete for research dollars on a level playing field with other schools within the National Sea Grant Program. 
Over the last weeks, we have all heard tales of the greatness of Lake Champlain and the Great Lakes. We all agree that these lakes share in the greatness, whether from their common geological history or their shared biological system that supports the diverse flora and fauna in the region. 
Lake Champlain is not as large as the Great Lakes of the Midwest, but it has proved its greatness throughout American history. The pivotal Battle of Valcour in 1776 on Lake Champlain was a key element in winning the Revolutionary War, because it turned back the British fleet coming down to resupply their forces. A turning point in the War of 1812 was the Battle of Plattsburg. And last year, the sister ship to the Smithsonian's Philadelphia, Benedict Arnold's gunboat, was discovered intact in Lake Champlain. So, if we expand the National Sea Grant Program to include Lake Champlain, we will be able to preserve the environmental, economic, and historical value of a lake that is a Vermont and a national treasure. 
The amendment I am offering today with Senators Levin and Abraham clarifies the definition of `Great Lakes.' Representative Fred Upton has also been extremely active and helpful in developing this solution. Senator Levin, the new chair of the Great Lakes task force, has made darn sure, as have his other colleagues and friends from the Midwest, that I have read every editorial written in their region. In fact, I expect at some moment to be in front of the blackboard saying, `I shall name'--but, because they are such good friends, and both are on the floor now, they didn't make me do that. But the fact that all of us are offering this amendment together is testimony to the shared understanding and respect for the importance of our lakes to our environment, our economy, and our history. 
Unfortunately, while we have that shared interest, we also share some common threats to our lakes. In the last year, we have witnessed the spread of the zebra mussel infestation throughout Lake Champlain, because we connect through the St. Lawrence Seaway, and we share that with the other lakes. These small freshwater pests are threatening native mussels, community water systems, and the network of underwater shipwrecks that make up a rich part of our Nation's history. In fact, scientists forecast that zebra mussels and other invasive species are likely to reach their maximum levels within the next few years. 
The zebra mussel represents one of the many connections between the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, having spread through waterways by boaters who travel among our lakes. We share other concerns such as toxic pollutants, nutrient enrichment and habitat degradation, and these threaten our common fisheries. 
For the most part, this Great Lakes debate has not been a dispute among scientists who know the common history and problems facing these lakes, but among politicians and columnists and radio talk show hosts. By pooling all of our resources on freshwater lake research and allowing schools conducting research on Lake Champlain to directly participate in the Sea Grant College Program, we are going to be better prepared to solve these environmental and economic problems. We have already heard from scientists who are excited about the prospect of sharing information and starting joint research projects to address these problems. 
Our amendment will build on our existing partnership and ensure the Sea Grant Program protects the water resources, biodiversity, and economic health of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. 
The purpose of my earlier amendment was not to change any maps but to promote ecological research on the common problems facing our lakes. I understand the symbolic issue this has become with our friends in the Midwest and, because they are my friends, I do not want to create problems for them. 
Even though we are the sixth largest lake in this country, we have agreed to call Lake Champlain the cousin instead of a little brother to those larger lakes in the Midwest. But we accomplish our goal of improving the ecological health of our lakes. I think it is a win-win solution that achieves our purposes while skirting the symbolism. We can say, `Mission accomplished,' because it means all our lakes will share the benefits of this research about the common problems, like phosphorous runoff, zebra mussels, and mercury pollution. It will help us avoid some of the pollution pitfalls that have stricken other lakes. 
In the meantime, it has been a marvelous tourism ad for our beautiful lake. I have never seen so many pictures of Lake Champlain on television ringed by the Adirondack Mountains of New York and the Green Mountains of Vermont. In fact, having watched some more pictures of it today, it makes me all the more homesick. I can't wait to be back home this weekend. 
I yield the floor with an invitation to any of my friends from the Midwest, or any other area: Come to Vermont; we would love to have you there.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my two friends from Michigan for their efforts on this. The distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, is on the floor now. We have spent hours going back and forth. And we are good friends. We talked about this a great deal, as we did with Senator Levin, whose office is down the hall from mine. It seems we went back and forth and discussed this over and over again, and the way to do it. 
I commend them because they have made it very clear they do not want in any way to hurt the ecology of the environment of Lake Champlain, which is a spectacular lake. They have tried to find a way that they can retain their own identity, a well-deserved identity, and with a remarkable geographic situation with the five lakes. And I think we have ended up with a win-win situation. 
So, Mr. President, I thank them for their help. It is one of the nice things about being in the Senate--when you know each other, you can sometimes work out things that would be more difficult otherwise. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues from the Northeast in support of Senator D'Amato's amendment providing assistance to dairy farmers devastated by an ice storm earlier this year. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment which will provide much needed assistance to dairy farmers in Vermont and throughout the Northeast. 
This storm which hit the Northeast on January 9 left dairy farmers in Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine without power for days at a time. I was happy to see that the disaster bill proposed by the administration and passed by the Appropriations Committee includes $4 million to reimburse dairy farmers for production losses suffered during the storm for milk that farmers were forced to dump. 
Unfortunately the bill did not consider the long term losses that will be suffered by farmers until milk production returns to pre-storm levels. Now cows don't know whether the power is on or off, they still need to be milked twice a day every day. In addition to the costs incurred by the dumped milk, many cows suffered mastitis as a result of the delayed milking or were thrown off in their milking cycle to the extent that their milk production levels were significantly affected. In Vermont, it is estimated that the cost of long-term production losses will be $186,300. The total damages throughout the region will be much higher. For small dairy farms, this is just one more cost they can not afford to shoulder. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on February 23, 1998 in Ankara, Turkey, a penal court handed down an important decision regarding human rights. Eleven board members of Turkey's largest independent human rights group, the Human Rights Association, were acquitted of charges of disseminating separatist propaganda and inciting racist and ethnic enmity at a December 1996 meeting. A request by prosecutors to close the organization was also rejected. 
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has pledged to make progress in protecting human rights, and the February 23rd decision is a commendable step forward by the Turkish Government in that process. Hopefully, the decision will encourage human rights advocates to pursue reforms in Turkey and protect them from similar persecution in the future. An active civil society in which people can organize and express their opinions without fear of prosecution and official harassment is essential to the fulfillment of Prime Minister Yilmaz's goal. 
Unfortunately, this step forward was recently marred by a step back. On March 12, 1998, a Turkish court acquitted ten policemen who were accused of beating and sexually abusing a group of teenagers. According to an article in the `Washington Post', the teenagers were arrested in December 1995 on charges of scrawling leftist graffiti and of belonging to a radical leftist armed group, a charge for which they were later acquitted. Over the course of the eleven days in which they were detained by police, the teenagers were allegedly blindfolded, stripped, molested, raped with police batons, and subjected to electric shocks to the genitals. 
According to the State Department's 1997 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, a judge in the case not only allowed the policemen to remain on active duty during the trial, he also relieved them of their obligation to personally appear in the courtroom. While these ten policemen walk freely, the teenagers will struggle with the physical and emotional consequences of their ordeal for years to come. 
Turkish officials have made some attempts to reduce abuses perpetrated by security officials against detainees. However, despite a constitutional ban on torture, improvements in government cooperation with foreign human rights inspection teams and new police training programs, torture remains common. According to the State Department, the climate of impunity fostered by the rarity of convictions of police or other security officials for killings and torture, `remains the single largest obstacle to reducing human rights abuses.' 
Mr. President, I welcome Prime Minister Yilmaz's pledge to make progress on implementing human rights reforms. I applaud the recent decision to acquit the members of the Human Rights Association. However, as the brutal incident involving the teenagers illustrates, there is a great deal more to be done. Turkish officials must take an active, visible, and sustained role in addressing all facets of human rights--from promoting civil and political liberties to upholding the rule of law. Lasting reforms will not be realized in Turkey until Prime Minister Yilmaz's pledge is backed by consistent efforts to bring human rights violators to justice.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Majority Leader has chosen to proceed to consideration of the nomination of Justice Susan Graber to the Ninth Circuit. Justice Graber currently serves on the Oregon Supreme Court. She was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee earlier this month. She has the support of both Oregon Senators and received the American Bar Association's highest rating. 
At her confirmation hearing, she was interrogated about two briefs that she had filed a number of years ago, in 1982 and 1984, in connection with cases being pursued by the ACLU. She was asked whether she is now or ever has been a member of the ACLU. She was asked whether she personally agreed with a number of positions taken recently by the ACLU. I objected to this line of questioning at the hearing and caution the Senate that we are headed down a road toward an ideological litmus test that does not well serve the Senate, the courts or the American people. 
I hope that Justice Graber's confirmation will signal a change of direction and a willingness of the Senate to confirm qualified judicial nominees. I was encouraged when Senator Sessions voted to report this nomination favorably and said: `I think she is a very talented nominee, has been an activist in some ways in her past, but has many good recommendations, and I think would have the capability of making an outstanding judge. I would support her nomination, although had I been making the nomination, I may not have nominated her.' I trust that is the standard that will be applied to other qualified nominees, as well. 
I remain concerned, as I look at the Senate Executive Calendar, that we are again passing over other highly-qualified nominees, nominees who will be confirmed by the Senate if they are ever allowed to be considered. In particular, I see G. Patrick Murphy, the nominee to the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and Judge Michael P. McCuskey, the nominee to the District Court for the Central District of Illinois. I spoke of these longstanding nominations yesterday, as well. I know that Senator Durbin is doing everything he can to try to have them considered by the Senate because they have been on the Senate calendar since last November, over 5 months; they are desperately needed in their districts; and they are so well qualified. 
I see Edward F. Shea, a nominee to the District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, and Margaret McKeown, the Washington State nominee to the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Shea was reported at the same time as two other District Court nominees who have been considered and confirmed and should likewise be considered and confirmed without further, unnecessary delay. Margaret McKeown was reported before the Justice Graber but has been skipped over, as well. Her nomination is fast approaching its two-year anniversary. She was reported by the Judiciary Committee on a vote of 16 to 2 and she has the support of Chairman Hatch and a number of Republican Senators. Why these outstanding nominees are being skipped is a mystery to me. 
Finally, we have reported to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was received back in June 1997. She, too, was favorably reported by a Committee vote of 16 to 2, once we finally considered her nomination. She is strongly supported by both New York Senators, yet the nomination continues to languish without consideration. This would fill one of the four vacancies that currently plague that Court. A fifth vacancy on this 13-judge court will arise before the end of this month. 
The confirmation of Susan Graber will mark the twelfth judge confirmed by the Senate this year. While we are still behind the pace the Senate established in the last nine weeks of last year, we can make a step in the right direction by proceeding to consider and confirm the five additional judicial nominees who remain on the Senate calendar and are ready for our consideration and favorable action. 
When the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in his 1997 Year End Report that `some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a . . . final floor vote' he could have been referring to Patrick Murphy, Judge Michael McCuskey, Margaret McKeown and Judge Sonia Sotomayor. 
Nine months should be more than a sufficient time for the Senate to complete its review of these nominees. During the four years of the Bush Administration, only three confirmations took as long as nine months. Last year, 10 of the 36 judges confirmed took nine months or more and many took as long as a year and one-half. So far this year, Judge Ann Aiken, Judge Margaret Morrow, and Judge Hilda Tagle have taken 21 months, 26 months and 31 months respectively. The average number of days to consider nominees used to be between 50 and 90, it rose last year to over 200 and this year stands at over 300 days from nomination to confirmation. That is too long and does a disservice to our Federal Courts. I urge the Republican leadership to proceed to consideration of each of the judicial nominees pending on the Senate calendar without further delay.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the President has withdrawn the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Massiah-Jackson continues as a respected Judge on the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas and has reiterated her commitment to public service to the city and citizens of Philadelphia. 
This nomination is a casualty of the confirmation process. As she described it: `After being found qualified to serve by the Specter-Santorum Judicial Selection Commission, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the American Bar Association and the Senate Judiciary Committee,' she was subjected to `an unrelenting campaign of vilification and distortion as [she] waited for a vote on [her] nomination by the full Senate.' She recognized that in the `politicized environment' in which this matter is being played out, she would have little opportunity to set the record straight once again. She has already devoted the better part of the last several days to that task, but the terrain keeps being shifted under her feet. 
Last week the Judiciary Committee held a hearing, ostensibly to allow Judge Massiah-Jackson an opportunity to respond to charges leveled against her record as a Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge. The hearing made a record that cleared up the most troubling allegation that had been made against her since her nomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee last November. No one who is familiar with the facts can continue to accuse her of having unmasked undercover narcotics officers sitting in her courtroom. That simply did not happen. 
Unfortunately, the hearing veered off into characterizations about other cases than those the nominee had been notified raised concerns and there was no opportunity for her to prepare to respond to questions about those cases at the hearing. Late Friday evening Judge Massiah-Jackson sent a written response to the Committee on those additional matters. In fairness, I encourage anyone concerned about the Richard Johnson, Spagna, Kennedy, Nelson, Williams, Thomas, Walker, Parks, Hill, Kevin Johnson, Hairston, Evans and Gregory Johnson cases to consider her response and review the trial records before accepting second-hand characterizations by her critics. 
Over the last several weeks a caricature of this nominee has emerged here in Washington rather than a true portrait of the woman who was elected to the bench in 1983 and retained by Philadelphia voters in 1993. No one should forget that the matters about which opponents are now complaining all took place before that 1993 retention election. Judge Massiah-Jackson's handling of important and complex civil matters over the last several years has been commended by the bar and not been criticized. The criminal cases from her earliest days on the court were concluded before the 1993 retention election and were not a source of controversy or criticism then. 
Having been condemned by some on the Senate floor in early February, Judge Massiah-Jackson returned to appear before the Judiciary Committee last week to correct the record. I said at the outset of that hearing that it would be hard for anyone to counteract in a few minutes the weeks in which opponents engaged in a whispering campaign and then in a blitzkrieg public relations effort to kill her nomination without affording her a fair opportunity to be heard. Unfortunately, the tactics continued as she was surprised with questions about cases that had not been previously been raised. 
I have searched my memory for any precedent for the way in which this nomination was attacked, but can think of none. It has too great an `Alice in Wonderland' quality to it. Senators were all too eager to accept any and every accusation without exploring its basis, allowing the nominee a fair opportunity to respond or reviewing the factual record. Like the King in Wonderland, on February 10 and 11, Senators had to be restrained from moving to a vote on the basis of accusations. The nominee was allowed a hearing on March 11 to respond, only to be met with new allegations. 
The Senate was intent on voting down her nomination again last week without allowing an opportunity for the nominee to respond to the new allegations. I could almost hear the Queen of Hearts objecting that there need be no deliberation, just `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.' I can understand why Judge Massiah-Jackson chose to forestall the `stuff and nonsense" that had come to characterize Senate treatment of her nomination. I regret the ordeal that she and her family were made to endure. 
I have noted before the respect I have for our colleague from Philadelphia and for his experience and judgment both as a prosecutor and as a Senator. Senator Specter has been a steadfast supporter of Judge Massiah-Jackson. He has done the work to evaluate the criticism of her record. He has looked at the trial records and the Philadelphia Bar Association report and compared the criticism to the facts. He knows the circumstances in Philadelphia that form the backdrop for the criticism of this nominee's record from local prosecutors and police. My own review of the cases leads me to the same conclusions that he has drawn: Prosecutors were disappointed in a number of her rulings but she had a basis in the record for the great majority of her orders. She has admitted to mistakes and been reversed on occasion, but that handful of errors should not have disqualified her from this appointment. 
This nominee has broad ranging support from both Democrats and Republicans in Philadelphia, a number of prosecutors and former prosecutors, distinguished representatives of the bar, and numerous State and local judges. Mayor Rendell, himself the District Attorney in Philadelphia for many years, is one of her strongest supporters. The Philadelphia Bar's review of the initial accusations about her record found many errors in the report of the district attorneys and concluded that her nomination continued to merit support. 
The Philadelphia Bar Association's report challenges many of the inferences and conclusions draw by the earlier submission of local prosecutors provided by the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association. Ironically, using the methodology of the Pennsylvania District Attorney's Association indicates that Judge Massiah-Jackson had a substantially higher conviction rate--a 25 percent higher conviction rate-- than the overall conviction rate for the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. The Philadelphia Bar also reports that Judge Massiah-Jackson actually imposed sentences above the Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines more frequently than other Philadelphia judges. Indeed, for the more serious offenses--including robbery, aggravated assault, rape, and drug felony offenses--by her last year hearing criminal cases she was five times more likely than other Philadelphia judges to impose tougher sentences than the guidelines required. 
For purposes of the record, let me briefly comment on the allegation that Judge Massiah-Jackson purportedly unmasked undercover narcotics officers in her courtroom. The story related to the Senate on February 10 was that Judge Massiah-Jackson `had ordered undercover policemen to stand up and be recognized in court so that any drug dealers that were there would recognize them if they saw them on the streets.' On February 11 this alleged incident was recounted to the Senate as follows: `In open court she told these arresting officers, who were working undercover, to turn around and told the drug dealers and other spectators to `take a good look at the undercover officers and watch yourselves.' She has been condemned for `making undercover agents reveal who they are to the drug-running community.' 
These are serious but unfounded charges and an example of the misinformation that has plagued this nomination. Judge Massiah-Jackson has consistently denied that she would ever have done anything to put police officers in danger and that she would not have publicly identified undercover officers who were concealing their identities. 
The Committee obtained brief written statements from the two Philadelphia police officers about which the allegations were made. It struck me that both officers' written statements noted that on the day of the alleged incident school children were brought to the courtroom to observe cases. One of the officer's written statements noted that during a break between cases the Judge addressed the children and that the alleged incident took place `after a short speech to the children.' The officer wrote: `I understand what she may have been trying to achieve with the kids.' 
I can imagine the Judge making a crime prevention or crime deterrence statement to a group of school children. It is possible that she told the school children not to commit crime, not to do drugs and not to be involved with drugs and that if they did they would likely be caught, tried and sent to jail. To drive home the deterrence point that they should not think that they can get away with anything, I can imagine the Judge directing the children's attention toward the officers dressed in their street clothes to make the point that officers do not always wear their uniforms and badges and that they could be anyone. One of the officers had already testified and identified himself as a police officer in open court. He was called `Officer' by the prosecutor. The transcript of that case indicates that the other officer was there and had been named in the course of the proceedings. The Commonwealth rested its case without formally calling the second officer to the stand. 
I also note that neither of the officers' written statements indicate that the Judge said anything disparaging. Nowhere is there any basis for the contention that she `ordered undercover police officers to stand up and be recognized in court' or `make undercover officers reveal who they are to the drug-running community.' Neither of the officer's statements indicate that she referred to the men as `undercover narcotics officers' or `undercover officers.' Those characterizations only surface later in assertions by a prosecutor who was seeking to have the Judge recuse herself the next year in a different case and in that prosecutor's later comments to a Philadelphia Daily News staff writer. 
The officers' written statements indicate that they have little more in the way of specific personal recollection of these matters than Judge Massiah-Jackson does. The written statements conflict with each other and with the subsequent newspaper account. Many of the specifics about the proceedings are simply incorrect. 
It seems to this Senator that some have been intent to make this alleged incident into something it was not. To the extent Judge Massiah-Jackson made any reference to the presence of officers dressed in street clothes in the courtroom, it appears to me that it was after the officers had identified themselves to those present as officers. They do not appear to have been acting as undercover officers in the courtroom and were not unmasked. From the testimony offered in the case they both had been in contact with both defendants. To the extent the Judge made any comments, they were most likely directed at a group of school children visiting the courtroom and were made in the course of a speech urging those children to stay away from crime and drugs. 
The Judge has long been involved with young people, often spent time as a classroom speaker, visited a number of Philadelphia's public and parochial schools and invited classes to visit her courtroom. Indeed, she visited an impressive array of schools to make presentations every year since joining the bench. 
I trust that we will hear no more about the allegation that she unmasked undercover officers in her courtroom. I regret that the reputation of this Judge has been clouded. I hope that those who want to know the truth will consult the record made in connection with the March 11 Judiciary Committee hearing and the court records in the cases at issue. 
In her letter to the President, Judge Massiah-Jackson noted that `our system of justice and the independence of this third branch of our government may be the most precious treasure bequeathed to us by the Founding Fathers.' I hope that in the future the Senate will show more respect for the independence of the judiciary and a more balanced approach in our review of judicial nominations.

Mr. LEAHY. What is the parliamentary situation? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-leahy-vt-2-19980316</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today there are 82 vacancies among the Federal judiciary. We can see another 15 vacancies on the horizon. If we confirm Jeremy Fogel to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in a vote this evening, then we will have confirmed 11 judges so far this year. That is less than four a month. When you know that you have close to 100 vacancies, 4 a month doesn't cut it. The President spoke to this issue; the Chief Justice spoke to it. The Senate can do a better job. 
At the end of last year the Senate was confirming on average three judges a week. In response to the plea by the Chief Justice in the 1997 Year End Report, the Senate can and should do better this year. 
Some still resist acknowledging the judicial vacancies crisis and contend that there are plenty of Federal Judges to handle the work of the courts and criticize the Judges for expanding their own jurisdiction. That is certainly not the case among the Federal Judges I know or the Federal Courts with which I am familiar. 
We should not perpetuate circumstances that require Chief Judges to impose so heavily on senior judges and visiting judges. That is why I introduced the judgeship bill recommended by the Judicial Conference that calls for creating 55 additional judges. Moreover, it appears to me that it is the Congress of the United States that has been expanding Federal Court jurisdiction and role--and may do so again if the Republican leadership has its way and passes its version of the juvenile crime bill and its takings bill. 
There is a need--in a growing number of cases, the desperate need--to fill the almost 100 vacancies that continue to plague the federal justice system. The President has spoken to the issue both last September and in his most recent State of the Union. The Chief Justice spoke to the matter again in the 1997 Year End Report. I have spoken until I am blue in the face. The Senate can do a better job to fulfill its constitutional responsibility and to support the third co-equal branch of our government. 
As the Chief Justice has pointed out, confirmations are taking longer and longer to the detriment of greater numbers of Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. I fear that the current delays will persist until each of you, concerned judges from around the country, begins to express outrage at the slowdown on judicial confirmations. Rather than have the Senate persist in efforts to micro manage the judiciary and attack its independence and integrity, I am seeking to have the Senate get on about the business of confirming judges and provided the resources courts need. 
Today 7 judicial nominees are listed on the Senate calendar. Unlike earlier days in the Senate when nominees were not made to wait for weeks and months on the Senate calendar before they could be considered, that is now becoming the rule. 
I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky nominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1994 and 1995 judicial nominees took on average 86 or 87 days from nomination to confirmation. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 days on average. Last year, that number rose dramatically yet again. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 was 206 days. 
During the entire four years of the Bush Administration there were only three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as long as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a year. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more than 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended over a year to a year and one-half. Of the 10 judges confirmed so far this year, Margaret Morrow took 21 months, Ann Aiken took 26 months, and Hilda Tagle took 31 months. 
Last year the President sent us 79 judicial nominations but the Senate completed action on fewer than half of them. The percentage of judicial nominees confirmed over the course of last year was lower than for any Congress over the last three decades and, possibly, at any time in our history. Left pending were 42 judicial nominees, including 11 who were first nominated in 1995 and 1996, and 21 to fill judicial emergencies. Still pending before the Senate are 6 nominees first nominated in 1995 and 3 more first nominated in 1996. 
Unfortunately, over the last three years, the Senate has barely matched the one-year total of judges confirmed in 1994 when we were on course to end the vacancy gap. We have less than 70 working days left in this Congress. The Senate has confirmed only 10 judges. 
We should start by clearing the Senate calendar of judicial nominees this week. I would like to commend the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, for his action in strong support of the two outstanding judicial nominees from his home state who have been languishing on the Senator calendar for months. I know Senator Durbin took action only after he had exhausted all his other options. 
It is time for the Senate to consider the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported these two nominations to the full Senate on November 6, 1997--more than 5 months ago. Their confirmations are desperately needed to end the vacancy crisis in the district courts of Illinois. 
Pat Murphy is an outstanding judicial nominee. He has practiced law in the State of Illinois for 20 years as a trial lawyer. During his legal career, Mr. Murphy has made an extensive commitment to pro bono service--dedicating approximately 20% of his working time to representing disadvantaged clients in his community. The American Bar Association recognized this extensive legal experience when it rated him as qualified for this nomination. 
Judge Michael McCuskey is an outstanding judicial nominee. Judge McCuskey served as a Public Defender for Marshall County in Lacon, IL from 1976 to 1988. In 1988, he left the Public Defender's office and the law firm of Pace, McCuskey and Galley to sit on the bench in the 10th Judicial Circuit in Peoria, IL. 
The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' There is no excuse for the Senate's delay in considering these two fine nominees for Districts plagued with judicial emergency vacancies. 
I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to have the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfil its constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. 
The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are growing more critical by the day. This is particularly true in the Central and Southern District Courts of Illinois, where these outstanding nominees will serve once they are confirmed. 
I hope that the Majority Leader will soon set a date certain to consider the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael McCuskey and do so promptly. 
I hope there will be a realization by those in this body who have started down this destructive path of attacking the judiciary and stalling the confirmation of qualified nominees to the federal bench that those efforts do not serve the national interest or the American people. I hope that we can once again remove these important matters from partisan and ideological politics.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Lugar, Biden, and Chafee in introducing the `Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998.' This legislation embodies a motto we take to heart in Vermont: `Act Locally, Think Globally.' From our campaign to ban landmines, Vermonters again learned the power of this maxim. 
Vermonters understand the social, economic and environmental impacts of deforestation. We started this century with 75 percent of Vermont forestland cleared for agriculture. Today, more than 80 percent of Vermont is forested. Rebuilding our forests and the Vermont tradition of living close to the land has helped Vermonters recognize that our healthy forests are a valued legacy which holds the key to achieving prosperity. This is the purpose of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will authorize more than $350 million over three years to enable developing countries to restructure their debt and use the new resources to protect their tropical forests. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 gives each country the power to protect its own resources without having to risk the health of its forests. 
Many developing countries have resorted to rapid development, including clear-cutting and slash-and-burn stripping of tropical forests, as ways to try to escape their debts. These forests contain a majority of the Earth's biological resources which provide the ingredients for many lifesaving medicines as well as providing us with the genetic sources to maintain healthy agricultural crops. 
Protection of these tropical forests also gives us with an opportunity to address one of the most critical global environmental issues facing us in the next century--global climate change. These forests serve important carbon sinks which store greenhouse gases and help regulate global temperatures. 
If we are going to reap these benefits though, we have to let nature do its work. This requires creative approaches to offer incentives to these developing countries to conserve forest resources for theirs, and our, children and grandchildren. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will help stem the rapid rate of deforestation and degradation of these sensitive ecosystems. 
As a Vermonter, I respect the importance of forests and the tough decisions which often have to be made in order to preserve them. I believe that this bill will make those tough decisions easier for countries which possess some of our world's most precious resources--tropical forests.

Mr. LEAHY. February might be seen as a month when our family would end the customary mourning period following the death of Cecile Pomerleau. 
However, for our family this has been a time of remembering more than mourning, and that is the way she would have wanted it. 
Cecile was a beloved mother to my wife, Marcelle, and her brothers, Rene and Claude, a loving and loved grandmother to Kevin, Mark, and Alicia Leahy, and Mark and Paul Pomerleau, to the spouses of her grandchildren, to nephews and nieces, and adopted daughter Sister Consolata--and without a doubt, the best mother-in-law I could have. 
For Cecile, family, above all else, was her world. Even in her final illness, her ailments seemed to melt away when Marcelle was there to care for her or when she knew her sons were arriving to be with her, when Kevin and Christianna visited and brought her home, when Mark and Kristine sat with her as they planned their new life together. A very special visitor was her `favorite' and only granddaughter, Alicia. Trips from Chicago by Mark and Paul Pomerleau meant so much to her. 
I so greatly benefited from her love and our daily talks and visits--and had in her the most loyal and accepting of any constituent! Even when I thought I did poorly in a Senate debate, she was there to tell me I really won. 
At her funeral, our son, Mark, talked of living with his grandmother while going to school. Here was a strong willed, young teenager living with a grandmother who was comfortable in a different language and different customs from his own. 
As he told us his story, with humor and love, we saw a grandmother wanting to move across generations to help her grandson--and a grandson meeting her at the generational chasm to accept her love. When he walked past the casket bidding farewell in French to his grandmother, all of us, through our tears, knew the bond. 
Cecile nearly left us a decade earlier. The love, sacrifice and nursing skill of her daughter, brought her back to life and gave her those extra years of fulfillment. 
I have often said that Marcelle's vocation as a registered nurse is aided by a God-given gift of healing. And no place was it more evident than when caring for her mother--indeed as she became her mother's mother. 
Marcelle brought us the essence of her mother when she said the following in a memorial service for Cecile at the Goodwin House. 
I was struck by one part of the history of her mother who had a professorship in music at the age of 17 but was told, of course, because of that generation, and especially being a woman, she would have to wait a year before she was old enough to go out into the world. Even though she had demonstrated the talent, genius, and everything necessary to get the professorship, she would have to wait 1 more year. 
Knowing my mother-in-law, knowing her genius for music, I suspect that was a somewhat frustrating year and she probably watched the pages coming off the calendar.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Marcelle and I loved our parents and we were loved by them. During the past decade and a half, we have seen them all leave--Howard, Phil, Alba, and Cecile. Such good friends and such good parents are in our memories today. 
It is strange, but I still find myself stopping momentarily now and then as if to call each of them, perhaps to say thank you for all each gave, to tell them their love will live on in their children and their grandchildren, but I think they knew that. They knew how much their children loved them. They knew how much their grandchildren loved them. And at a time when it becomes almost a cliche to talk about family values, our parents gave such great family values to us. The love of all the children for them has been so strong, and the grandchildren, especially, were fortunate to have grandparents that they could know and love. 
We lost Cecile last February, but this February, a year later, her first great grandchild, Roan Seamus Nichols Leahy, joined the family. Knowing Cecile, she would consider this timing quite fitting, and her wonderful heart, if she were still alive, would expand to include him in her love with all the rest of us. 
I say au revoir, Maman. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have before the Senate one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Senate will consider this year, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998, the so-called ISTEA II bill. The bill touches every American, from Vermont to Florida, from Washington State to Washington D.C. ISTEA II, with its transit and safety subtitles, will spend more than $215 billion over six years on our nation's highways, transit systems, and safety programs. 
That is a lot of money, but it is sorely needed. The United States has the largest transportation system in the world--170,000 miles of National Highway System routes, 900,000 miles of other Federal-aid roads, and 3.7 million miles of public roads. Prior to 1991, our national priority had been on building the national Interstate system which had been under construction since 1957. Six years ago, thanks to the leadership of Senators Moynihan and Chafee, this nation made a fundamental change in the way that it allocates its public investment in transportation. That change was based on the premises that local people understand local needs, that funding should be flexible, and that transportation should contribute to meeting national environmental and public health goals. In my estimation, ISTEA has been a resounding success. 
The bill before the Senate will come to be known as ISTEA II. I want to commend the managers of the bill, Senators Chafee and Baucus, for crafting a landmark piece of legislation. This bill is good for the nation and good for my state of Vermont. It maintains and enhances our transportation commitments in ways that Vermonters will be proud of. 
First of all, the bill maintains its flexibility. Vermont will retain full authority, in partnership with local governments, to decide an appropriate level of investment in roads, bridges, bicycle paths, and transit. One of the most important additions to this bill is a provision that will allow Vermont to spend its highway money on Amtrak capital improvements. Our small state has two successful Amtrak trains, both of which operate with assistance from the state. If this provision survives the conference committee with the House of Representatives, Vermont Amtrak service can be expanded to include even more communities. In western Vermont, our Ethan Allen train could be expanded to serve Bennington, Rutland, Middlebury, and Burlington. 
The second goal that this bill will accomplish is that it strengthens ISTEA's commitment to the environment. There is increased funding for congestion mitigation, a new wetlands restoration pilot program, continued funding for recreational trails, and a greater than 25% increase in funds for bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways. 
Finally, this bill will bring more resources to Vermont. It will give Vermont a major boost in highway and transit funding, so we can better maintain our existing roads. We need the funds. For example 41% of Vermont's bridges are structurally deficient, the 11th worst rate in the nation. Today we get about $78 million in federal highway funds. Under the bill which we will pass today, Vermont will annually receive $118 million on average for the next six years. 
Operating assistance for transit will increase from about $1.5 million annually to $1.8 million annually. A new $750 million trade corridor and border infrastructure program will result in enhancements at Vermont's border with Canada. A big reason for the increase for Vermont's funds is because, for the first time since 1993, every cent of the gasoline tax will be spent on roads. For the last six years, 4.3 cents of the gas tax have been dedicated to reduce the federal deficit. But with the federal budget in balance for the first time in 30 years, we can now spend those funds on badly needed transportation infrastructure. 
We live in a competitive world, Mr. President. Many of our economic competitors pay their workforce much less than comparable workers here in the United States. Yet we often not only compete with the world, but we lead it in many industries. One of the big reasons why we compete and win is because we have a superior transportation infrastructure. Mr. President, this bill will modernize our infrastructure, while protecting the environment and giving Vermonters unprecedented choice in how to spend federal funds. I am proud to vote for the bill, and I hope that the Senate preserves as much of it as possible in conference.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, public and private institutions all across the United States have invested enormous amounts of time and money to educate Americans about the dangers from smoking, and to curb tobacco advertising especially that targets minors. Nationwide campaigns have raised awareness about the health and economic costs of cigarettes. Lawmakers have focused on holding the tobacco companies responsible for the incalculable harm their products, and their decades of lies, have done to our society. Parents, schools and local governments have joined together to keep children from starting to use tobacco. 
The attention has paid off, although their is much more that needs to be done. Laws that seek to protect children from tobacco advertising have become stricter, warning labels on cigarette packaging contain stronger language, the price of cigarettes has gone up, and regulations on second-hand smoke have become broader and more inclusive. The number of stories in the media about the tobacco industry and the horrors of lung cancer and emphysema are an indication of how far we have come. 
What has been sorely lacking, however, is the same kind of attention on the effects of tobacco use in developing nations where an estimated 800 million people smoke and the consumption of cigarettes is rising steadily. As the market for tobacco products in the US declines, tobacco companies are aggressively pursuing these lucrative foreign markets. It is projected that adult consumption of cigarettes in the developing countries will exceed that in the industrialized countries within the next decade. These figures do not even take into account that in many developing countries the number of people under eighteen--those most susceptible to tobacco advertising and most inclined to start smoking--is more than fifty percent of the population. In a matter of years, tobacco will be a leading cause of death in countries whose poor healthcare systems cannot possibly care for them. 
Why should this matter to us? Each year, we provide billions of dollars in foreign aid to improve the lives of people overseas. We spend tens of millions of dollars to support foreign health programs. It is absurd that in the same countries where we are spending precious American tax dollars to try to save lives, American tobacco companies are pushing their deadly products. 
Until recently, it was even worse than that. According to a February 16, 1998 `New York Times' article, there has been a long history of collaboration between the US Government and tobacco companies to introduce American cigarettes into foreign markets and to fight anti-smoking regulations overseas. It is reported that in 1992 the US Government and the tobacco companies worked hand-in-hand against an effort by Thai authorities to require tobacco companies to disclose the ingredients in their cigarettes. 
Fortunately, the US Government is finally catching up with the times. In February, the State Department directed our embassies and foreign commercial offices to stop promoting the sale or export of American tobacco products. They were also told to stop trying to block restrictions from being placed on these products. 
Mr. President, the dangers of smoking have been established and Americans are responding by taking steps to curb their tobacco consumption. As our efforts against tobacco in the US pay off, we must also help the developing countries curb their own consumption. One step in the right direction is the Healthy Kids Act, of which I am a cosponsor. Introduced by Senator Conrad on February 12, 1998, the Act contains a provision to establish the `American Center on Global Health and Tobacco' to assist other countries curb tobacco use. 
In addition, on July 23, 1997 Senator Lautenberg introduced the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act. It would subject exported cigarettes to the same restrictions on labeling that apply to the sale and distribution of cigarettes in the United States and prevent U.S. Government officials from working against other countries' restrictions on tobacco. We should do everything we can to try to protect the people in those countries from the dangers of tobacco, as we are protecting ourselves. Hundreds of millions of lives, and billions of dollars that could otherwise be used to educate, house and employ people, are at stake.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am delighted that the Senate has passed the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, S. 1605. I thank Senator Campbell for his leadership on our bipartisan legislation which is intended to save the lives of law enforcement officers across the country by helping state and local law enforcement agencies provide their officers with body armor, this issue. It has been a pleasure working with the senior Senator from Colorado to pass this vital legislation in the Senate. I also want to thank the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his strong support of S. 1605. 
Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year while serving to protect our citizens. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 30 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
Unfortunately, far too many state and local law enforcement agencies cannot afford to provide every officer in their jurisdictions with the protection of body armor. In fact, the Department of Justice estimates that approximately 150,000 State and local law enforcement officers, nearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor. 
In countless incidents across the country everyday officers sworn to protect the public and enforce the law are in danger. Last year, an horrific incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border underscores the need for the quick passage of this legislation to provide maximum protection to those who protect us. On August 19, 1997, Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New Hampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. He had shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two other victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with the authorities, Drega was killed. 
During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore bulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For example, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, was seriously wounded in the incident. I am glad that Officer Pfeifer is back on the job after being hospitalized in serious condition. Had it not been for his bulletproof vest, I fear that he and his family might well have paid the ultimate price. 
The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega were not so lucky. We all grieve for them and our hearts go out to their families. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective vests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous officers because of the high-powered assault weapons, but the tragedy underscore the point that all of our law enforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the best protection we can provide, including bulletproof vests. 
With that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law enforcement officers. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 will help by creating a new partnership between the federal government and state and local law enforcement agencies to help save the lives of police officers by providing the resources for each and every law enforcement officer in harm's way to have a bulletproof vest. Our bipartisan bill would create a $25 million matching grant program within the Department of Justice dedicated to helping State and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor. 
In my home State of Vermont, our bill enjoys the strong support of the Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law enforcement officials. In January, I was honored to be joined by Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, Vermont Commissioner of Public Safety James Walton, Vermont State Police Director John Sinclair, Vermont Fish and Wildlife Lieutenant Robert Rooks, South Burlington Police Chief Lee Graham, South Burlington Vermont Officer Diane Reynolds as we spoke about state and local law enforcement officers' need for body armor. 
Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes to our attention. 
Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be `routine.' In fact, the National Association of Chiefs of Police just reported that 21 police officers were killed in the line of duty last month, nearly double the toll for the month of January in both 1997 and 1996. More than ever, each and every law enforcement officer across the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently spoke on the floor about the disgust that I share with most Americans about the tactics of Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr and the disturbing spectacle of hauling a mother before a grand jury to reveal her intimate conversations with her daughter in a matter, which--even if all the allegations about the daughter's conduct were true--do not pose grave threats to the public safety. This matter does not, for example, involve any allegations of violence or drug trafficking conduct. 
In this instance, as in others, Mr. Starr has scurried to apply all of the legal weapons at his command, but none of the discretion that he is obligated to exercise as one invested with almost unchecked legal authority. I also expressed my intent to introduce legislation to study whether, and under what circumstances, the confidential communications between a parent and his or her child should be protected. A number of professional relationships of trust are already protected by legal privileges, but not familial relationships. This is the legislation I introduce today. 
Currently, under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, privileges are `governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.' Thus, in the absence of any Supreme Court rules or federal statutes, courts look to the United States Constitution and the principles of federal common law to determine the applicability and the scope of privileges. 
Legal academicians have expressed support for a parent-child testimonial privilege. The public policy reasons favoring such a privilege are numerous and relate to the respect we accord to fundamental family values. Recognition of such a privilege could foster and protect strong and trusting family relationships, preserve the family, safeguard the privacy of familial communications and intimate family matters against undue government intrusion, and promote a healthy environment for the psychological development of children. 
Despite these myriad reasons, there are indeed cases and circumstances when parents should be compelled in court to share what they know from their children. Indeed, courts have generally not been receptive to the parent-child privilege. Only four States--Idaho, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York--have adopted either by statute, or by judicial recognition, some form of a parent-child privilege. No Federal Court of Appeals have recognized this privilege nor has any State Supreme Court that has considered the issue. In my own State of Vermont, such a privilege is not recognized. 
To my mind, and as a former prosecutor, prosecutors should show restraint before putting parents in the untenable position of making a legal determination as to whether their children should come to them for advice, or whether the parents instead should feel legally pressured to refer their own children to professional therapists, or lawyers, or doctors in order to protect the confidentiality of the child's communications. To be sure, there are some categories of cases, particularly cases involving grave threats to the public safety, such as violent or drug trafficking crimes, where the 
government can and should appropriately seek testimony from a parent about what a child has said. But we should all be clear about when prosecutors should also show restraint. 
Courts have recognized privilege claims in a variety of professional relationships, ranging from attorneys to priests to psychotherapists. Yet the relationship between parent and child--the most fundamental relationship in our society--is generally not so protected in any circumstances. As one New York court explained:  
It would be difficult to think of a situation which more strikingly embodies the intimate and confidential relationship which exists among family members than that in which a troubled young person, perhaps beset with remorse and guilt, turns for counsel and guidance to his mother and father. There is nothing more natural, more consistent with our concept of the parental role, than that a child may rely on his parents for help and advice. Shall it be said to those parents, `Listen to your son at the risk of being compelled to testify about his confidences?'--In re Application of A&M, 61 A.D.2d 426, 403 N.Y.S.2d 375, 378 (1978). 
We should consider the sorts of circumstances and the types of cases in which prosecutors should be asked to show some restraint before turning to parents to provide evidence against their children. That is why my bill calls for a study and report by the Justice Department on what these circumstances should be, and to develop prosecutorial guidelines accordingly. Specifically, these guidelines should identify when the communications between parents and their children should carry the same protections as preferred professional relationships, and the circumstances and types of cases when those communications should be subject to government scrutiny. 
We cannot rely on the courts to formulate an appropriate parent-child privilege. The Third Circuit recently declined to recognize the parent-child privilege, noting that: 
The legislature, not the judiciary, is institutionally better equipped to perform the balancing of the competing policy issues required in deciding whether the recognition of a parent-child privilege is in the best interests of society. Congress, through its legislative mechanisms, is also better suited for the task of defining the scope of any prospective privilege. . . . In short, if a new privilege is deemed worthy of recognition, the wiser course in our opinion is to leave the adoption of such a privilege to Congress: In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Impounded), 103 F.3d 1140, 1148, 1153 (3d Cir. 1996). 
Likewise, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that `courts have been reluctant to create new privileges, preferring to leave such matters to the legislature despite any policy reasons supporting recognition of a particular privilege.' United States v. Riley, 653 F.2d 1153, 1160 (7th Cir. 1981). 
Congress should accept this challenge. My bill is a start to the process of seeking expert input on the significant question of when the government may not compel parents to betray the confidences of their children, and when because of compelling need or the nature of the case or circumstances, parents should be required to reveal the substance of what their children have told them. 
Thus, the bill I introduce today directs the Attorney General to develop Federal prosecutorial guidelines to protect familial privacy and parent-child communications in matters that do not involve allegations of violent or drug trafficking conduct. In addition, the legislation would direct the Judicial Conference to undertake a study and then give us a report on whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended to explicitly recognize a parent-child privilege in cases not involving violent or drug trafficking conduct, and, if so, in what circumstances that privilege should apply. 
While we should endeavor to provide the maximum protection for parent-child communications, we should also be careful not to unduly obstruct law enforcement. Nor should the rule be susceptible to litigious mischief. 
Accordingly, the Attorney General and the Judicial Conference will need to address, as part of the study and report called for in my bill, a series of important questions, including:

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 
from its origins as a U.S.-based research vehicle, the Internet has matured into a democratic, international medium for communication, commerce and education. As the Internet evolves, the traditional means of organizing its technical functions need to evolve as well. 
In the days before the Internet, the U.S. Defense Department's research network--called the ARPAnet--used a naming system that would map a computer's numerical address to a more user-friendly host name. With only a few computers linked to the ARPAnet, the U.S. Defense Department's research network maintained a master list of each computer's numerical address and host name. Sending an electronic message or file was a simple matter of looking up the computer's host name on a master list to find its numerical address. As the number of host computers grew, however, it became clear that a new addressing system was needed. Thus, in 1987, the current Domain Name System (DNS) was created. 
On today's Internet, the DNS works through a hierarchy of names. At the top of this hierarchy are a set of Top Level Domains that can be classified into two categories: generic Top Level Domains (gTLD) such as `.gov,' `.net,' `.com,' `.edu,' '.org,' `.int,' and `.mil,' and the country code Top Level Domain names, such as `.us' and `.uk.' Before each TLD suffix, is a Second Level Domain name. 
Since the Internet is an outgrowth of U.S. government investments carried out under agreements with U.S. agencies, major components of the DNS are still performed by or subject to agreements with U.S. agencies. Examples include assignments of numerical addresses to Internet users, management of the system of registering names for Internet users, operation of the root server system, and protocol assignment. 
For the past five years, a company based in Herndon, Virginia, named Network Solutions, Inc., has served under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation as the exclusive registry of all second level domain names in several of the gTLDs (e.g., .com, .net, .org, and .edu). This contract will end next month, with an optional ramp-down period that expires on September 30, 1998. 
The National Science Foundation's exclusive arrangement with Network Solutions regarding the assignment of domain names has drawn criticism from Internet users. This arrangement has also been the subject of antitrust scrutiny by the Justice Department and of two lawsuits in Federal Court. I wrote to Attorney General Reno in July 1997, asking to be kept apprised, as appropriate, of any developments in the Justice Department's antitrust 
investigation concerning the assignment of the most popular domain names for Internet addresses. I was assured that the Department's objective was consistent with my concerns to ensure that the DNS functions, to the maximum extent possible, in an open, competitive environment that maximizes innovation and consumer choice. 
Despite the controversies associated with certain aspects of Network Solutions' management of the gTLDs, many of us have been concerned about what would happen at the end of that company's exclusive contract. Simply put, how will we avoid chaos on the Internet and the potential risk of multiple registrations of the same domain name for different computers? 
That is why I welcomed the Administration's intent to address this issue comprehensively. In the Administration's `Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,' the President last year directed the Secretary of Commerce to privatize, increase competition and promote international participation in the DNS. At the beginning of this year, I wrote to Secretary Daley requesting that the Administration present its policy recommendations regarding the management of the DNS without further delay, lest the stability and integrity of the Internet domain name system be threatened. 
On January 30, 1998, the Commerce Department released a `Green Paper,' or discussion draft, entitled `A Proposal to Improve Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses,' proposing privatization of the management of the DNS through the creation of a new, not-for-profit corporation. This organization would set policy for the allocation of number blocks to regional number registries; oversee operation of the root server system; determine when new top-level-domains should be added to the root system; and coordinate development of protocol parameters for the Internet. 
While the corporation would be able to decide when to add new gTLDs, the Administration has indicated that it does not want to wait until the corporation is formed to bring competition to the domain name registration process. Thus, the Green Paper proposes to allow firms other than Network Solutions assign addresses that end in the gTLDs: `.com,' `.org' and `.net.' The Green Paper also proposes the creation of five new gTLDs, each of which would be based on registries operated by separate firms. The Administration continues to solicit comments on the Green Paper from the DNS stakeholder community, and hopes to finalize and begin implementation of the Green Paper's proposals in April 1998. 
Developing this proposal to privatize and increase competition in the DNS was an important and difficult task. I am delighted that the Administration undertook this herculean effort and has finally released its draft proposal to improve the DNS. I especially applaud the hard work of Ira Magaziner, Senior Advisor to the President for Policy Development, Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and Becky Burr, Associate Administrator, NTIA, Office of International Affairs. 
I fully agree with the four basic principles guiding the Administration's proposal to structure this evolution; namely that private sector control is preferable to government control; competition should be encouraged; management of the Internet should reflect the diversity of its users and their needs; and stability of the Internet should be maintained during the transition period. These shared principles form the basis of a solid framework from which to determine the evolution of the DNS. That being said, I think it prudent that the Green Paper--already shaped by months of discussions with a variety of Internet stakeholders--is in the form of a discussion draft and that additional public comments are being solicited. The Internet is a democratic form of communication, and changes in its management structure warrant consideration through an open and democratic process. 
Among the more challenging questions presented by the Green Paper are how to protect consumers' interests in locating the brand or vendor of their choice on the Internet without being deceived or confused, and how to protect companies from having their brand equity diluted in an electronic environment. Adding new gTLDs, as the Green Paper proposes, would allow more competition and more individuals and businesses to obtain addresses that more closely reflect their names and functions. On the other hand, businesses are also rightly concerned that the increase in gTLDs may make the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or dilution more difficult. Recent news reports have highlighted the prevalence of `stealth' domain name addresses, which are slight spelling variations on the addresses of popular Web sites used to increase visits by potential subscribers. For instance, as reported in the March 2, 1998 edition of Newsweek, `www.whitehouse.com' is an explicit adult Web site. One needs to use the domain name `www.whitehouse.gov' to reach the White House's web site. 
Congress recently addressed certain trademark issues with passage of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. That legislation proscribes the dilution of famous trademarks in circumstances that might not otherwise amount to trademark infringement. When that legislation passed the Senate, I noted that `no one else has yet considered this application,' but expressed `my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others.' Congressional Record, S 19312 (December 29, 1995). 
Over the past several years, I understand that disputes between trademark owners and domain name owners have been on the rise. To address the legitimate concerns of trademark holders and the diverse needs of Internet users, the Green Paper proposes that a study be undertaken on the effects of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures on trademark and intellectual property rights holders. Specifically, the Green Paper states:  
We also propose that . . . a study be undertaken on the effects of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures on trademark and intellectual property rights holders. This study should be conduced under the auspices of a body that is internationally recognized in the area of dispute resolution procedures, with input from trademark and domain name holders and registries. 
Although some of the recommendations in the Green Paper have proved to be controversial, I understand that DNS stakeholders of diverse background and interests, including those businesses who are concerned that the increase in gTLDs may make the job of protecting their trademarks from infringement or dilution more difficult, such as ATT and Bell Atlantic, support this Green Paper recommendation. The legislation I introduce today directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patent and Trademarks, to request the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects on trademark and intellectual property rights holders of adding new gTLDs and related dispute resolution procedures. The study shall assess and, as appropriate, make recommendations for policy, practice, or legislative changes regarding: (1) the short-term and long-term effects on the protection of trademark and intellectual property rights and consumer interests of increasing or decreasing the number of gTLDs; (2) trademark and intellectual property rights clearance processes for domain names, including whether domain name databases should be readily searchable through a common interface to facilitate the `clearing' of trademarks and intellectual property rights and proposed domain names across a range of gTLDs; identifying what information from domain name databases should be accessible for the `clearing' of trademarks and intellectual property rights; and whether gTLDs registrants should be required to provide certain information; (3) domain name trademark and intellectual property rights dispute resolution mechanisms, including how to reduce trademark and intellectual property rights conflicts associated with the addition of any new gTLDs and how to reduce trademark and intellectual property rights conflicts through new technical approaches to Internet addressing; (4) choice of law or jurisdiction for resolution of trademark and intellectual property rights disputes relating to domain names, including which jurisdictions should be available for trademark and intellectual property rights owners to file suit to protect their trademarks and intellectual property rights; (5) trademark and intellectual property rights infringement liability for registrars, registries, or technical management bodies; and (6) short-term and long-term technical and policy options for Internet addressing schemes and their impact on current trademark and intellectual property issues. 
The bill also calls upon the Secretary of Commerce to seek the cooperation of the Patent and Trademark Office, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, other Commerce Department entities and all other appropriate Federal departments, Government contractors, and similar entities with the study. 
I use the Internet frequently, and I therefore have a personal stake in ensuring that the evolution of the DNS is one that makes sense from an end-user perspective. In addition, I am proud to say that Vermont companies have been leaders in cyber selling. Both users and companies seeking to do business on the Internet have a direct stake in ensuring that the DNS develops in a manner that protects the rights and promotes their shared interests.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with Chairman Hatch concerning satellite television that I hope will prove to be good news for consumers throughout the nation and in Vermont. 
I greatly appreciate this opportunity to work with Chairman Hatch and Senator Kohl. 
We intend for this bill to lead to head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers. This should open more choices and services to Vermonters, at lower prices. The bill also will allow householders who want to subscribe to this new satellite TV service to receive all local Vermont TV stations by satellite. The goal is to offer Vermonters more choices, more TV selections--and especially of local programming--but at lower rates. 
In areas of the country where there is this full competition with cable providers, rates to customers are considerably lower. I helped foster the home satellite industry with passage of the Satellite Home Viewer Act in 1988 and the extension of that act in 1994. Now it is time for the home satellite industry to offer a competitive alternative to cable. It is my hope that we can foster that competition and do so in a way that preserves the local perspective and service provided by the local network affiliate system. 
This bill is intended to permit satellite TV providers to offer the networks through their local TV channels to viewers throughout Vermont and a full complement of superstations and movies. This means that local Vermont TV stations will be available over satellite to many areas of Vermont currently unserved by satellite or by cable. 
I have received scores of letters from Vermonters who have complained about the current situation. Under current law, it is illegal for satellite TV providers to offer local TV channels over a satellite dish when you live in a area where you are likely to get a clear TV signal with a regular rooftop antenna. 
This means that thousands of Vermonters living in or near Burlington cannot receive local signals over their satellite dishes. I understand their frustration. At our farm in Middlesex, we receive signals from one and a half stations. 
This bill is intended to adjust the statutory copyright licenses in order to allow satellite carriers to offer local TV signals to viewers no matter where they live in Vermont. To take advantage of this opportunity, satellite carriers will in general have to follow the rules that cable providers have to follow. This will mean that they must carry all full-power local Vermont TV stations in their TV offering. 
Today, Vermonters receive satellite signals with programming from stations in other states. In other words, they would get a CBS station from another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate. I hope that our bill will correct this upside-down situation and make network programming available to all, while preserving local programming and respecting the affiliate system. 
By allowing satellite providers to offer a larger variety of programming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be able to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing with satellite carriers. Cable will continue to be a highly effective competitor with its ability to offer extremely high-speed Internet connections to homes and businesses. 
A major reason I voted against the Telecommunications Act of 1996--and I was only one of five who voted against that bill--was my fear that cable, satellite and telephone rates would go up significantly in rural states. I wish I had been wrong, but the rates, in fact, have been climbing since then. When fully implemented this bill should reverse that trend as has been the case in cities where there were competitors to cable. 
The second major improvement in this bill is that satellite carriers that offer local Vermont channels in their mix of programming will be able to reach Vermonters throughout our state. The system will be based on regions called Designated Market Areas, or DMAs, established through marketing surveys done by the Nielsen Corporation ratings organization. 
Vermont has one large DMA covering most of the state and part of the Adirondacks in New York--the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA--and parts of two smaller ones in Bennington County (the Albany-Schenectady-Troy DMA) and in Windham County (the Boston DMA). 
Over time those two counties could be included in the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA depending on marketing, advertising and other demographic factors that Nielsen Corporation examines. 
This new satellite system is not yet available. Companies are preparing to launch spot-beam satellites to take advantage of this bill. I encourage them to do so. Using current technology, signals would be provided by spot-beam satellites using some 150 regional uplink sites throughout that nation to beam local signals up to two satellites. Those satellites would use 60 spot beams to send those local signals, received from the regional uplinks, back to satellite dish owners. High-definition TV would be offered under this system at a later date. 
Under this bill, and using this spot-beam technology, home 
owners with satellite dishes in downtown Burlington, and in almost every county in Vermont, would receive all the full-power TV stations in the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA, including Vermont public television. Therefore, subscribers to the new satellite technology would be able to receive WPTZ, WCAX, WNNE, Vermont public television, and other full-power broadcast stations, throughout most of Vermont. Bennington residents would receive the stations in the Schenectady-Albany-Troy DMA. Windham County residents would receive full power stations in the Boston DMA. 
As I mentioned earlier, Bennington and Windham Counties could be included in the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA at a later date as the demographics of the region evolve, or as technology changes. 
Under this bill, Vermonters will have more choices. Those who want this new satellite service will be allowed to sign up in the next couple of years or keep their present satellite service. 
Those who want to stick with cable, or with regular broadcast TV, are able to continue their viewing in those ways. Since technology advances so quickly, other systems could be developed before this bill is fully implemented that would provide other service but using different technologies. 
I share the frustration of so many that laws and regulations in this case have tended to frustrate consumer choices and stifle technology. That is not the way it should be. It is time to update our satellite viewing laws to encourage full and vigorous competition with the cable industry and expand viewer options.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, drunk drivers are a menace to all of us. Last September, a car driven by an alcohol-impaired teenager went off the road near Montpelier, Vermont, killing teenagers Brian Redmond and Ryan Kitchen. This was a rare enough tragedy in Vermont that it sent the entire state into mourning. Nationwide, however, the story is far different. More than 40 percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol-related--more than 17,000 in 1996 alone. 
I am proud that Vermont is one of only 15 states that already has a .08 blood alcohol standard. Vermonters have a longstanding awareness of the dangers of drunk driving, and I advocated adoption of the toughest state drunk driving laws in the nation while serving as State's Attorney in Chittenden County. Today, Vermont has a state law which lowers the threshold for drivers under the age of 21 to .02 percent, one of the toughest laws in the nation. 
The amendment which we are considering will establish a .08 standard in all 50 states. If enacted, states will have three years to enact .08 laws, or they will have a portion of their highway construction funds withheld. With all due respect to the cosponsors of this amendment, I have reservations about this approach. I have always been a senator who believes that, whenever possible, Congress should respect each state's right to govern itself. I am uncomfortable when we in Washington say that we will penalize states financially when they do not behave as we see fit. I think we in Congress use that threat too often. Instead of punishments, we should offer incentives for states to adopt tougher drinking and driving laws. It would be better to offer supplemental transportation resources to those states that meet a higher standard. The rest of the states would follow soon enough once they see their neighbors benefitting from doing the right thing. 
Nevertheless, I am convinced that Senator Lautenberg's amendment will save lives, just as the .08 standard has saved lives in Vermont. Although this amendment will not directly affect Vermont, I will vote for it. I am convinced that we can send a strong signal to all Americans that there should be one standard for drinking and driving. This nation has made some progress in the war on drinking and driving, and with this legislation we can save still more lives.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know that the Senate will, very soon, go to a vote on another judge. It is March. For those who are keeping track, that makes the sixth judge confirmed this year in the third month. Let me see, three into six, as I recall, goes twice. So that's two judges a month. I don't want to strain the capabilities of the U.S. Senate, but there are 85 vacancies. There are 85 vacancies and now, in March, we will confirm the sixth Federal judge. 
Justice denied is justice lost. 
We are not seeing our responsibility to the Federal judiciary. As long as the Senate maintains a stall on the confirmation of Federal judges, we are not being responsible, we are not even upholding our oath of office. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for getting another judge here to be confirmed. I ask the Senate to remember that we have responsibilities to the Constitution, and we have a responsibility to the integrity and independence of the third branch of Government. We are not fulfilling it. 
Mr. President, I am going to withhold the rest of my time because the distinguished chairman is not here. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be allowed to withhold its time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has decided to take up the nomination of Richard L. Young to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. 
This is one of seven judicial nominations that is currently pending before the Senate. I spoke a little earlier this afternoon about this. 
I want to note that, unfortunately, the Senate continues to pass over the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy for a vacancy on the Federal bench of the Southern District of Illinois and Michael P. McCluskey for a judicial emergency vacancy on the Federal bench for the Central District of Illinois. 
Nor is the Senate today taking action on the nomination of Edward Shea to the Federal bench for the Eastern District of Washington, Judge Jeremy Fogel to the judicial emergency vacancy on the Federal bench for the Northern District of California or Margaret McKeown to a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
Judge Young has been with the Vandenburgh Circuit Court of Indiana since 1990. After Senator Lugar came to the Judiciary Committee to testify in his behalf, Judge Young was reported by the Committee without a single dissenting vote. The American Bar Association gave Jude Young its highest rating. 
I believe there will be a unanimous vote in support of this nomination and want to congratulate him and his family. 
The Senate returns this week facing 85 Federal court vacancies--85. Despite the Senate's dismal record for 2 years running in acting on judicial nominations, I finally saw reason to hope that the extremism that has bedeviled this process might be losing a tiny bit--a tiny bit--of its hold on the Senate. 
Few nominees have been targeted as heavily for defeat as was Margaret Morrow, a superbly qualified nominee for a district court judgeship in Southern California. She endured waves of questions, protracted stalling and mysterious holds that prevented an up-or-down vote. Finally, 2 years after she was nominated, she got an overwhelming, super majority, positive vote here in the Senate. I wanted to take that as a signal that public concerns about these logjams were beginning to register with the Senate. 
But, unfortunately, that nomination was the last nomination confirmed by the Senate in February. We closed out our first 2 months this year with only five confirmations for article III judges. 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist spoke forcefully on the judicial vacancy crisis that is plaguing the Federal courts. He warned: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the Federal judiciary.' 
Justice delayed means justice denied, because without judges courts cannot try cases, sentence the guilty or resolve civil disputes. Partisan and narrow ideological efforts to impose political litmus tests on judicial nominees and to shut down the judiciary must stop. 
We began this year facing vacancies in about one out of every 10 judgeships, and about one-third were judicial emergency vacancies which have been empty for more than a year and a half. 
Mr. President, if all we are going to do so far is two judges a month, and we have 85 vacancies, the Senate is not living up to its responsibilities. The Senate is not upholding the Constitution of the United States and not fulfilling our responsibilities to the judicial branch or the American people. 
The first week of this session I challenged the Senate to maintain the pace that it reached last fall when we confirmed 27 judges in the last nine weeks of the session. In the first four weeks of this new session, however, we have acted to confirm only five judges. Judge Young will be the sixth judge confirmed in this our fifth week in session. We are well short of the mark and not measuring up to the pace this very Senate attained last fall. I, therefore, urge the Majority Leader to take up the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy, Michael P. McCluskey, Edward F. Shea, Jeremy D. Fogel and M. Margaret McKeown without further delay. 
Mr. President, I withhold my time remaining, and, if we are ready to go for a vote, I will yield it.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the agreement signed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has averted, for at least the time being, the use of military force against Iraq. 
Contrary to the statements of some Members of Congress, I do not believe this signifies that the President of the United States has subcontracted the nation's foreign policy to the United Nations. Rather, I believe the President, who has said he would use force as a last resort, had good reason, indeed an obligation, to delay while the Secretary General sought a diplomatic resolution of this crisis. 
I also believe the agreement, while not perfect, deserves the support of the international community, including the United States, and I say that even if, as many predict, Saddam violates this agreement as he has every other agreement since the end of the Gulf War. 
I have said repeatedly that force cannot be justified until every diplomatic option has been exhausted. The agreement obtained by the Secretary General shows that we have not yet reached that point. 
Seven years ago the United States led a military coalition of Western and Arab nations to force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. The United States invested an enormous amount in the Gulf War. 246 American soldiers lost their lives. Since then, we have maintained the no-fly zone and provided humanitarian relief to Iraqi Kurds who have been brutalized repeatedly by Saddam Hussein's army. 
The Gulf War ended when Iraq signed a cease-fire agreement, in which Iraq agreed to promptly disclose and destroy its entire arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Shortly thereafter, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 687, which clearly described Iraq's obligations under the cease-fire agreement. Those obligations have the force of international law. Subsequent resolutions have reaffirmed the need for complete Iraqi compliance. 
Since that time, Saddam Hussein has systematically reneged on his commitments under the cease-fire agreement. He and his government have repeatedly denied the UN weapons inspectors access to sites they sought to inspect and which they have every right to inspect. 
In his speech last Tuesday, President Clinton described the numerous instances that the Iraqis have lied about their chemical and biological weapons programs, and revised their reports describing what they possess only after their lies were exposed. Any number of times the inspectors have closed in on a suspicious site only to be refused access, or to see an Iraqi truck drive away in an obvious attempt to hide incriminating evidence. 
If Saddam Hussein had nothing to hide, why would he have gone to such lengths to prevent the UN inspectors from doing their job, particularly since there is no way the UN sanctions will be lifted as long as the Iraqis fail to cooperate fully with the weapons inspectors? There is no doubt that since 1991, Saddam Hussein has squandered his country's resources to maintain his capacity to produce and stockpile chemical and biological weapons. 
That history of deception is what brought us to the brink of war. The agreement obtained by the Secretary General reaffirms, at least on paper, Iraq's obligations regarding the UN inspectors. It also gives Iraq some basis to hope that the sanctions could eventually be lifted. 
Had the Secretary General failed, the missiles and bombs might already be raining down on Iraq. We would have had to expect American casualties. Out of hundreds or thousands of sorties, some American pilots may well have been shot down and taken prisoner. Iraqi civilian casualties were predicted to number in the thousands. 
While there is no doubt that we can do tremendous damage to Iraq's military capabilities, war is fraught with uncertainties. Victory can be bitter sweet, and short-lived. Those who have taken the Secretary General to task should explain what gives them confidence that more would have been achieved through bombing. Do they really believe that the lives of thousands of innocent people are not worth the time it takes to test the agreement? Are they prepared to refight the Gulf War, with ground troops, to get rid of Saddam? I seriously doubt it. 
I fully agree with the President that nothing short of free, full and unfettered access for UNSCOM must be our objective. I have been deeply concerned, however, that the use of military force would not achieve that objective, and that it might well cause the inspectors, who have been doing 90 percent of their job without interference, to be barred from Iraq entirely. 
Then we would know even less about his arsenal of biological and chemical weapons, while Saddam Hussein emerges defiant and victorious in the Arab world for having successfully stood up to the military might of the United States. Damaging Iraq's facilities is a poor substitute for Iraq's compliance with the terms of the cease-fire agreement, if that can be achieved by other means. 
Having said that, I am not against using force under any circumstances. Nor do I believe that we can achieve our objectives in Iraq without the credible threat of force, because it is the only thing Saddam Hussein understands. The Secretary General suggested as much himself, although he used the words of a diplomat. But if it is as likely as not that force will not coerce Saddam to permit full access for UNSCOM, and that it could even result in an end to inspections in addition to thousands of civilian casualties, and enhance Saddam's standing in the Arab world. This may show again that it would have been wrong to give up on diplomacy. 
It is elementary that diplomacy requires flexibility, just as it requires creative thinking. Both, I am sad to say, have been in short supply during this crisis. I was not prepared to support the use of force against Iraq prior to the Secretary General's trip to Baghdad because I was not convinced that there had been a serious attempt at creative diplomacy. In fact, I was concerned about the apparent inflexibility of the administration, not on the question of access for the UN inspectors which I do not believe can be compromised, but on other issues such as the sale of oil so Iraq has some realistic hope of being able to meet its obligations under the cease-fire agreement, which include compensation for Kuwait and Israel. 
I was also concerned that administration assertions that the embargo would not be lifted until Saddam Hussein is removed from power, as desirable as that is, were inconsistent with the cease-fire agreement, and gave the Iraqi Government little reason to even attempt to comply. 
The Secretary General's initiative showed that a degree of flexibility and creative thinking can prevent bloodshed. While Saddam has shown many times that he is ruthless and untrustworthy, that is not a reason to abandon diplomacy as long as there is a glimmer of hope. It may produce a better outcome. That is worth finding out. 
Or it may not. Saddam has not agreed to anything different than he had before and the agreement is devoid of details on several important points. There is uncertainty about which facilities are `presidential sites,' and the procedures for inspections of such sites have yet to be determined. 
There are concerns that the agreement could undercut the independence of UNSCOM if its authority is shifted to a commission named by the Secretary General. However, according to Secretary of State Albright, the Secretary General has assured her that Richard Butler, the current head of UNSCOM, will remain in charge. 
There are unresolved questions about the role of the diplomats who are to accompany the inspectors. UNSCOM's success has been a result of its independence, and that absolutely must be preserved, both for purposes of its activities in Iraq and for inspections elsewhere. The wrong precedent here could come back to haunt us years from now somewhere else. The proof will be in the interpretation, and whether or not UNSCOM is able to do its job without physical or political interference. 
Whether the use of force would be justified, or wise, if the agreement fails I will leave for another day. But we should remember that despite all the destruction leveled on Iraq during the Gulf War, it was not enough to prevent Saddam Hussein from defying the international community and using every trick in the book to rebuild his military arsenal. 
If we bomb Iraq again, he would be right back at it, claiming victory for standing up to the US, but no longer under the watchful eye of UNSCOM's cameras. Then what would we do, after we are blamed for causing more innocent deaths on top of the Iraqi victims of the embargo for which we are deemed primarily responsible? 
How do we avoid being back in the same situation in six months or a year? What about the risk of exposing our forces to poison gas or biological toxins, which might be inadvertently released in a bombing attack? 
How do we weigh the risks of further damaging our relations with the Arab world, and with Russia? If we cannot get rid of Saddam, what is our long-term policy? Or are we prepared to do what it takes to get rid of him? 
These questions need answers, especially if Saddam breaks his word again and the President decides to use force. If that day comes I would urge him, as others have done, to first seek authorization from the Congress. 
This is not a situation where the United States is facing imminent attack. It is not the type of situation that was contemplated by the War Powers Act, when the President could single-handedly involve the country in a war for a limited period of time because there was not adequate time for the Congress to declare war. There would be time. The Congress has that responsibility. Some Members of Congress would duck that responsibility and put it all on the President. That is not why we are here. We owe it to the American people to speak. 
The use of force on this scale, under the circumstances contemplated here, would have grave consequences for the American people, for our entire country. Likewise, the failure to use force if Iraq again violates the cease-fire agreement could have lasting implications for the international community's efforts to deter the manufacture and use of chemical and biological weapons and to uphold international law. For these and other reasons, the Congress should fully debate these issues and render its own judgment.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from West Virginia for his comments on ISTEA. I note--he may have noted this before I came on the floor--that the Washington Post today had an article by Eric Pianin speaking of the problems specifically, in the State of Vermont in getting this ISTEA money through. In our State--this also occurs in Maine and, obviously, in parts of the beautiful State of West Virginia--we have a very early fall and extremely late spring and heavy snows in between. We have a fairly short construction season. 
I hope that the majority leadership of both bodies will get this bill up, get it voted on, take the amendments up, vote them up, and vote them down to get it over with so that States--whether it is West Virginia, or North Dakota, or Vermont, or Arizona, or any other State represented by Senators now on the floor--could get on with this. 
I hate to think of the amount of money that would be wasted if this is delayed much longer, and then we have to scramble to get the contracts out. It is taxpayer dollars that get wasted where interests are not taken care of. 
The Senator from West Virginia has been on the floor several times already on this. He has certainly been diligent in meetings with other Senators off the floor. And I commend him for doing this. He is doing a service to the country.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, dueling for the lead on the front page of every newspaper in this country over the past month have been two stories: Whether the United States will send American soldiers into battle with Iraq, whether people will die in Iraq on both sides, or whether the President of the United States had an affair months ago with a former White House intern. Fueled by what have been titillating leaks and innuendo, the story of the alleged affair and Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation has, more often than not, stolen the lead. 
I have spoken before about the high volume of information that apparently originates from prosecutor Starr's office. The press has cited as sources `several Federal investigators,' `one official involved in the discussions,' or `sources close to independent counsel Kenneth Starr,' and `government officials.' Whether or not the material concerns matters before the grand jury may be relevant to whether a criminal violation occurred, but the distinction is of no relevance as a matter of prosecutorial ethics. It is prosecutorial ethics that I am concerned about. 
The distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator 
Specter, who shares with me a former career as a prosecutor--a career both of us are proud of--knows that a prosecutor's case should be tried in court and not the press. When I spoke about Mr. Starr earlier, Senator Specter came to the floor on January 27 to repeat Mr. Starr's `emphatic denial' that his office was in any way responsible for these stories, as Senator Specter had a perfect right to do. But less than 2 weeks after that denial--the denial made by Mr. Starr--Mr. Starr acknowledged, on February 5, his `regret that there have been instances, so it would appear, when that [grand jury secrecy] rule has not been abided by,' and announced that he was initiating an internal investigation to determine whether his office was responsible for the leaks. Perhaps his `emphatic denial' was too hastily put. 
We will see if Mr. Starr pursues that internal investigation of his own office with anything even approaching his zealous pursuit of the President and the First Lady. 
One of the most disturbing spectacles we have seen from Mr. Starr's inquest is that of a mother being hauled before a grand jury to reveal her intimate conversations with her own daughter. And she is, of course, not the only one. According to press accounts, Monica Lewinsky's close friends have had to fly in from California to testify, at whatever expense that might be, to hiring lawyers, and so forth. Bystanders--people who just happened to be standing there--at White House events where both the President and the former intern were both present have also been given grand jury subpoenas, as have those who used to supervise her work or work alongside the former intern. In this investigation, even the possibility of gossip based upon gossip, hearsay based upon hearsay, is enough to bring you into the chambers of Kenneth Starr. For witnesses, this may be a matter of having to spend all the money you have saved for a college education, your children's education, or anything else, to pay for lawyers, if there is even a possibility that you might have been somewhere in the area and might have known something--even though you are not alleged to have done anything wrong, even though nothing wrong was alleged to have happened while you were standing there. 
But, as a father, no tactic was more shocking than the treatment that Mr. Starr gave the mother of the former White House intern at the center of this controversy. Every single parent wants to be able to provide comfort and advice to a son or a daughter who is in trouble or in need of solace. No attorney, no doctor, no clergymen, no psychotherapist, no spouse would, in most States, be faced with the awful choice of the mother caught in the machinations of Mr. Starr's expanding investigation. Her choice, as I understand it, was refuse to testify--refuse to say what confidence she had shared with her own daughter--and, if she did refuse, be faced with contempt proceedings, including possible jail time. She would either go to jail or betray her child's confidences. 
This is the United States of America. This is not the Star Chamber of hundreds of years ago. This is not the Spanish Inquisition. No child, no matter what their age, expects his or her conversations with a parent to be disclosed to prosecuting attorneys, 
compelling a parent to betray his or her child's confidence is repugnant to fundamental notions of family, fidelity, and privacy. Indeed, I can think of nothing more destructive of the family and family values, nor more undermining of frank communications between parent and child, than the example of a zealous prosecutor who decides to take advantage of close-knit ties between mother and daughter, of a prosecutor who said, if a mother loves a daughter and a daughter will go to a mother to talk to that mother, then we are going to grab the mother. Great family values, Mr. President. Great family values, Mr. Starr. 
As one law professor said, `I want my child to be able to come to me and share anything in the world. Neither of us should be fearful in the back of our minds, that if I'm hauled in front of a grand jury, I'll either have to hurt my child or put myself in legal jeopardy.' If my child were in trouble and chose, as I hope that child would, to come to me, I would be loathe to have to refer my child to an attorney or priest or psychiatrist, because they have a privilege, and say, `You can't talk to your own father or your own mother.' Family bonds of blood, affection, loyalty and tradition deserve as much protection as the professional relationships of trust that are already protected by legal privileges. 
Frankly, I can tell you right now if a child of mine confided in me, no grand jury, no prosecutor, no runaway special counsel would get me to talk about my child. I would tell that special prosecutor, `Have you no shame? Have you no shame?' I would go to jail before I would ever disclose one word that a child of mine said to me. That is the feeling this Vermonter has. And that is the feeling of the shame of a prosecutor who would force a mother--a mother--to talk about what her daughter may have told her. It is awful. 
Four States already have adopted or recognized some variant of the parent-child privilege. One Federal circuit to consider whether a parent-child privilege should be recognized in Federal proceedings, refused to recognize this privilege stating:  
The legislature, not the judiciary, is institutionally better equipped to perform the balancing of the competing policy issues required in deciding whether the recognition of a parent-child privilege is in the best interests of society. Congress, through its legislative mechanisms, is also better suited for the task of defining the scope of any prospective privilege. . . . In short, if a new privilege is deemed worthy of recognition, the wiser course in our opinion is to leave the adoption of such a privilege to Congress. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 103 F.3d 1140 (3d Cir. 1996). 
The third circuit is right to let Congress consider this important issue. We in Congress should take up this challenge since we apparently cannot trust the sound judgment of certain prosecutors. I am going to have a bill which will be a start. 
We have to assume the reason we have not had legislation on this before is that prosecutors showed some discretion. A prosecutor is the most powerful position, usually, in government. He or she can decide not only when to bring a prosecution but when to withhold, whether to initiate an investigation or whether to withhold. Prosecutors generally do not think of bringing parents in and browbeating them. But I am going to ask for a study to see what legislation we might have to prevent abuses in this area. 
Perhaps we should also confirm in legislation that there is a Secret Service privilege. On this issue I am glad the Justice Department has apparently concluded there is such a privilege. Presidential security and privacy demand such a privilege. Imagine if there were no such privilege. The challenge to this privilege could result in changing the way our President and other officials, including foreign dignitaries, are able to be protected. To avoid being witness to private conduct, will security details be forced to change where they stand, where officers are placed, how many officers are assigned, and so on? Without a privilege, will 
officers on security detail be forced to carry litigation insurance to pay for attorneys when they are called upon to testify as to what they observed? We should not be forcing officers to change the way they carry out their duties simply to avoid being called upon to testify by investigators of unprecedented zealotry. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I might have 5 more minutes.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is troubling to me, I have been approached by law enforcement officers within our FBI who speak about being concerned that they may be assigned to the special prosecutor's office because they are going to be asked to look into things they normally never would have looked into as law enforcement officers; that there is a reputation that this special prosecutor's office has of an overconcentration on private sexual conduct of people--and not just the President but others as well--that they are going to be asked to look at things that as trained professional law enforcement people they usually do not look at. 
I have also been approached by Secret Service agents who talked to me about the fact that they have been called upon to protect foreign dignitaries and others and now ask, are they going to be in a situation where they don't dare come close because they may overhear something of personal conduct and may then be called upon to testify to it? Do they have to worry that in carrying out their own duties they may find themselves bankrupted paying lawyer fees later on? This is a matter of some concern. I hope the feelings of these people are not widespread, but they may well be. 
I have supported the independent counsel statute in the past, but never before have I been so disturbed by the tactics, judgment, and, at minimum, the appearance of partisanship by an independent counsel as I have by those of Mr. Starr and his staff. At a time when we need an independent counsel with the confidence of the American people, we do not have one. 
For example, although a highly respected independent counsel, Robert Fiske, had concluded that Vincent Foster's death was a result of suicide, Mr. Starr, prodded by Richard Mellon Scaife and other right-wing activists, reopened that investigation. He spent years doing it. He spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money doing it. He dragged the Foster family and friends through that experience again. He made people again have to hire lawyers. Then what happens? He reaches exactly the same conclusion that Mr. Fiske did before, but doing the bidding of someone else. 
Mr. Starr publicly justifies his rush to secretly tape Monica Lewinsky to expand his Whitewater land deal investigation because a close friend of the President helped her find a job. If the source of job offers can prove influence, then Kenneth Starr is in deep trouble and probably he should consider resigning. Just 1 year ago, Mr. Starr accepted a job offer for a teaching position funded largely by Mr. Scaife, the same well-known conservative publisher and financier who thought that the Foster case should be reopened, who has helped publicize allegations of wrongdoing by the President. Who knows what the status of that job offer is now? 
In order for people to have confidence in the results of an investigation, that investigation must be nonpartisan and perceived to be nonpartisan. That is not the case when it comes to Mr. Starr. My friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, as a former prosecutor, fully appreciates that principle as well. I understand he, too, has questioned the wisdom of having Mr. Starr head an investigation into the alleged affair since his activities have raised such an appearance of partisanship. I again urge Mr. Starr to do what is in the interests of the country and to consider whether his judgment has been so affected, whether he is now so driven to achieve a result, that he should reconsider his own role in the process. 
The Senator from Vermont must conclude that Prosecutor Starr 
has not used his power responsibly and has failed his duty. Kenneth Starr is not the impartial, neutral and independent prosecutor the American people need now and the President, as would any American, deserves. 
I predicted that his investigation may mark the death knell of the independent counsel statute. Before it is reauthorized, we ought to take a hard look at safeguards and accountability here. To have a nation on the brink of war preoccupied with affairs of the bedroom rather than of state is an abomination. More time has been spent on weekend talk shows talking about a White House intern than on the President's decision whether to use force against Iraq. 
The good news is that while the rest of the country may be distracted by whom Mr. Starr will next drag before his grand jury, the President and his administration are properly focused on speaking to the American people about the circumstances that brought us to the brink of battle. The administration's preparations for battle surely helped bring about the proposed agreement the United Nation's Secretary General Kofi Annan has reached with Iraqi officials, and I remain hopeful that diplomacy, backed by the commitment to use force, will result in a peaceful resolution of this standoff. I look forward to reviewing the details of that agreement. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their forbearance, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if there is one thing that anyone who visits Norwich, Vermont does not forget, it is Dan & Whit's General Store. Dan & Whit's is a Vermont legend, as are its namesakes, Dan Fraser and Whit Hicks, who bought the store back in 1955. Since then it has become the unrivaled nerve center of business, socializing, and political debate for Norwich and the surrounding area. Whit died a while back, Dan has since retired and his wife Eliza, known to all as Bunny, who did the bookkeeping, died not long ago. But the store has not lost any of the Vermont character they gave to it. Fortunately it has stayed in the family. Today it is managed by Dan's sons George and Jack Fraser, with the help of George's wife Susan, Jack's daughter Cheri, George's sons Dan and Matt, and a throng of loyal employees, young and old. 
When you first enter Dan & Whit's you think it is just another grocery store. Of course there is a lot more Vermont maple syrup and cheddar cheese. But then you notice winter boots and snowshoes hanging from the ceiling, and boxes of nuts and bolts and nails and screws and every type of hardware. There are pots and pans, outdoor clothing, pens and stationery, guns and `No Hunting' signs. Keep walking and you pass piles of the `New York Times' and the paint mixing machine, and then you realize you have barely scratched the surface. Through a door and around a corner there are aisles that stretch almost as far as you can see, stacked high with snow shovels, horse feed, half a dozen sizes of stove pipe, sheep fence, sewing pipe, sleds, saws and axes, rakes and wheelbarrows, mail boxes, window glass, there's no end to it. You can even bring in your fire extinguishers for recharging, Jack being the Captain of the Norwich Fire Department. Thus the Dan & Whit's motto, `if we don't have it, you don't need it.' Vermont author Noel Perrin once wrote, `There may be a better general store in the United States. But I haven't heard of it.' 
Mr. President, Dan & Whit's General Store is the unbelievable number and variety of things you can buy there, but it is also the extraordinary people who work there. In addition to the Fraser family members, it is people like Larry Smith, Linda Conrad, Al Langlois, Ron Swift, and Perry Wagner, who have been there for years and help make the store the one-of-a-kind place that it is. Dan & Whit's is people like Bill Fitzgerald, who finally retired after more than 30 years. Always in good spirits, always helpful, always finding what you need. And the one time in a million that they don't find it, they will convince you that you did not need it in the first place.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support to legislation introduced by Senator McCain, S. 1578, to make Congressional Research Service Reports, Issue Briefs, and Authorization and Appropriations products available over the Internet to the general public. 
I applaud the goal of this legislation to allow every citizen the same access to the wealth of information at the Congressional Research Service (CRS) as a Member of Congress enjoys today. CRS performs invaluable research and produces first-rate reports on hundreds of topics. The taxpayers of this country, who pay CRS's annual budget of $60 million, deserve speedy access to these wonderful resources. 
I understand that the staff at CRS has raised some questions about how this bill may affect their charter mandate to provide `confidential analysis and information exclusively for Congressional clients.' I want to work with Senator McCain, the other cosponsors of this bill and the Senate Rules Committee to ensure that Members who request confidential research have control over the release of that research. But we can do both--protect truly confidential research and give our citizens electronic access to non-confidential CRS products. 
I want to commend the Senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on opening public access to Congressional documents. I share his desire for the American people to have electronic access to many more Congressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the days to come on harnessing the power of the information age to open up the halls of Congress to all our citizens.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia has again held the line-item veto unconstitutional. I respect the decision of Judge Thomas F. Hogan. I respect it not only because his analysis is consistent with that which led me to oppose this legislation when it was being considered by the Senate. I also respect it because it was right as a matter of constitutional law and as a means to preserve the separation of powers that is so central to the checks and balances that preserve our freedoms and liberty. 
We hear a lot of speeches around here condemning judges. Here is a Judge who has done his job and stood up for the Constitution against the ill-advised action of the political branches. 
It is not our independent federal judiciary that is upsetting the limits of government and fundamental freedoms of us all. Congress has shown a dangerous tendency over the last few years to ignore constitutional limits on Federal legislative branch authority. Maybe it is Members of Congress who need to read the Constitution and consider its wisdom. 
The last week of its last term, the United States Supreme Court struck down three congressional actions as unconstitutional, including the so-called Communications Decency Act and the Brady Act, both of which I voted against. The Supreme Court withheld ruling on the line-item veto law at that time, because it held that the plaintiffs in that case were without standing to bring the challenge. It was just a matter of time and occasion. The decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the earlier case had presaged the ruling today. The line-item veto was and is unconstitutional. I proudly stand with Senator Byrd on this matter. 
I would ask Congress to step back from this specific decision and consider how unprecedented this is: Four statutes that do not comport with the constitutional limits on congressional authority overturned from a single Congress. 
It is unfortunate that Congress is far too often overstepping its constitutional bounds. It is unfortunate that the courts have to rein Congress in from time to time, with increasing frequency as the Republican majority loses its moorings, but that is the thankless responsibility of the courts under our system of checks and balances. 
I have come to this floor often in the last several months to defend the judiciary against shrill attacks. I come today to offer my continuing gratitude and respect for our co-equal branch of government. We are the envy of the world in part because our free and independent judicial branch has served our country so well for more than 200 years. 
We should be doing more to keep it that way, not less. We are finally beginning to consider longstanding judicial nominations to fill the vacancies that plague the federal judiciary and threaten the administration of justice. We need to do more. We should consider without further delay the judiciary's requests for the resources that they need. We should consider S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act, which I introduced at the request of the Judicial Conference to provide an additional 55 judges where needed around the country. We should act on S. 394, which I sponsored with Senator Hatch to unlink judicial salaries from our own. We should consider and confirm qualified nominees to the 83 vacancies to the federal courts. 
Finally, I hope that members of Congress will rethink the rush to propose amendment to our Constitution and consider how well our fundamental charter serves us. We do not need to rewrite the Constitution, we need to respect it and act in accordance with its design.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am proud to join the Vice President, Vice President Gore, Senator Conrad, and other colleagues, in support of comprehensive tobacco control legislation. I believe it is time for the Congress to join the President's call to curb teenage smoking. 
But I believe that as a U.S. Senator, as a Vermonter, and as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that the HEALTHY Kids Act improves the proposed national tobacco settlement in two key areas--this is what I am looking at in tobacco settlements--that you have to have full document disclosure and that there can be no immunity for the tobacco industry. 
The reason I say this, Madam President, is I have here a 1974 marketing plan by RJR Tobacco. 
In 1974 they were saying how they have to target the 14-to-24 age group. In 1974 they were saying how they had to put their ads together so that people in the 14-to-24-year-old group could be targeted, could become cigarette smokers, could become addicted, and once addicted would remain their customers until they died. Of course, so many of them did die of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases. 
These documents became public almost a quarter of a century later only because of the suits that are going on, only because of the forced disclosure. I say whatever we do in tobacco legislation, make sure all documents have to be disclosed and make sure that there is no immunity to the tobacco industry. 
I want to thank Senator Conrad for working with me to craft legislative language that calls for full disclosure of all tobacco industry documents relating to the health effects of tobacco products, the control of nicotine in tobacco products and the marketing of tobacco products. This disclosure to the FDA includes key documents that the industry may claim as privileged. 
After internal review, the FDA has the authority to publish these documents to further the interests of public health. And these documents will be available on the Internet for every citizen to finally learn the full truth about the tobacco industry. 
Contrary to its public relations ploys, the tobacco industry is still using stonewalling tactics to keep industry documents secret. Minnesota Attorney General Skip Humphrey has been prying loose documents that reveal much about the past practices of tobacco corporations. But the tobacco industry continues to abuse its attorney-client privilege by trying to block damaging documents from being publicly released. Again, yesterday, the court in Minnesota found the tobacco industry improperly used the attorney-client privilege to hide thousands of industry documents. 
This stonewalling will stop and the American people will know all the facts about the tobacco industry under our bill. Second, our bill scraps the sweetheart deal of immunity for the tobacco industry from punitive damages and class action lawsuits that was in the proposed national settlement. 
Every day we learn more and more about documents that reveal industry schemes to market their deadly product to children and hide smoking-related health research. 
Marketing cigarettes to 14 year-old children is outrageous. Is that the kind of conduct that we should reward with unprecedented legal protections? In the words of today's 14 year-olds, `Get real.' 
Under our bill, a state may resolve its attorney general suit or take on the tobacco industry in court, as Minnesota is doing. It is up to the people of that state, not a Washington knows best approach. I am confident that Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell knows the facts in his lawsuit against big tobacco and will weigh the best interests of Vermonters in making the decision whether to opt-in to the bill's settlement provisions. 
I strongly believe that this comprehensive tobacco control legislation puts the interests of our children ahead of the interests of the tobacco lobby. 
I look forward to working with President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Senator Conrad and my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact it into law. 
I thank again my good friend from Indiana. I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this really has been a long time coming, and I appreciate the effort of my friend, the chairman, who is on the floor, to support this nomination. I commend my good friend, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, who has been indefatigable in this effort. She has worked and worked and worked. I believe she has spoken to every single Senator, every single potential Senator, every single past Senator, certainly to all the judges, and she has been at us over and over again to make sure that this day would come. She has worked with the Republican leader, the Democratic leader, and Republican and Democratic Senators alike. I appreciate all that she has done. We have all been aided by our colleague, Senator Feinstein. She has spoken out strongly for Margaret Morrow as a member of the Judiciary Committee and as a Senator. 
I feel though, as Senator Boxer has said, that none of us would have predicted that it would take 21 months to get this nomination before the Senate. I know that we would not even be here now if the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished majority leader had not made the commitment before we broke last fall to proceed to this nomination this week. 
I have spoken about this nomination so many times I have almost lost track of the number. I will not speak as long as I would otherwise today because I want to yield to the Senator from California. But I think people should know that for some time there was an unexplained hold on this outstanding nominee. This is a nominee, incidentally, who was reported out of the Judiciary Committee twice. This is a nominee who is the first woman to be the president of the California State Bar Association and a president of the Los Angeles County bar. 
This is a nominee who is a partner in a prestigious law firm. This is a nominee who has the highest rating that lawyers can be given when they come before our committee for approval as a judge. This is a woman about whom letters were sent to me and to other Senators from some of the leading Republicans and some of the leading Democrats in California and from others whose background I know only because of their reputations, extraordinary reputations. I have no idea what their politics are. But all of them, whether they describe themselves as conservatives, liberals, moderates or apolitical, all of them say what an extraordinary woman she is. And I agree. 
I have read all of the reports about her. I have read all the things people said in her favor, and the things, ofttimes anonymous, said against her. I look at all those and I say of this woman: If I were a litigant, plaintiff or defendant, government or defendant, no matter what side I was on, I could look at this woman and say I am happy to come into her court. I am happy to have my case heard by her--whether I am rich, poor, white, black, no matter what might be my background. I know she would give a fair hearing. 
Now, finally, after 12 months on the Senate calendar without action over the course of the last 3 years, I am glad that the debate is beginning. I am also glad we can now look forward to the end of the ordeal for Margaret Morrow, for her family, her friends and her supporters. 
Her supporters include the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and half the Republican members on that committee. The Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, calls her `an excellent addition to the Federal bench.' All of these people have praised her. 
To reiterate, this day has been a long time coming. When this accomplished lawyer was first nominated by the President of the United States to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Central District of California, none of us would have predicted that it would be more than 21 months before that nomination was considered by the United States Senate. 
I thank the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for fulfilling the commitment made late last year to turn to this nomination before the February recess. Fairness to the people and litigants in the Central District of California and to Margaret Morrow and her family demand no less. 
I trust that those who credit local law enforcement and local prosecutors and local judges from time to time as it suits them will credit the views of the many California judges and local officials who have written to the Senate over the last several months in support of the confirmation of Margaret Morrow. I will cite just a few examples: Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block; Orange County District Attorney Michael R. Capizzi; former U.S. Attorney and former head of the DEA under President Bush, Robert C. Bonner; former Reagan Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division and former Associate Attorney General and current Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen S. Trott; and California Court of Appeals Associate Justice H. Walter Croskey. 
I deeply regret that confirmation as a Federal Judge is becoming more like a political campaign for these nominees. They are being required to gather letters of support and urge their friends, colleagues and clients to support their candidacy or risk being mischaracterized by those who do not know them. 
Margaret Morrow's background, training, temperament, character and skills are beyond reproach. She is a partner in the law firm of Arnold & Porter. She has practiced law for 24 years. A distinguished graduate of Bryn Mawr College and Harvard Law School, Ms. Morrow was the first woman President of the California State Bar Association and a former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She has had the strong and unwavering support of Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein of California. 
In light of her qualifications, it was no surprise that in 1996 she was unanimously reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1997 her nomination was again reported favorably, this time by a vote of 13 to 5. 
Yet hers has been an arduous journey to Senate consideration. She has been targeted--targeted by extremists outside the Senate whose $1.4 million fundraising and lobbying campaign against judges needed a victim. As our debate will show today, they chose the wrong woman. 
Lest someone accuse us of gratuitously injecting gender into this debate, I note the following: Her critics have gone so far as to deny her the courtesy of referring to her as Ms. Morrow. Instead, they went out of their way repeatedly to refer to her as `Miss' in a Washington Times op ed. Margaret Morrow is married to a distinguished California State Court Judge and is the proud mother of a 10-year-old son. It is bad enough that her words are taken out of context, her views misrepresented and her nomination used as a ideological prop. She is entitled to be treated with respect. 
Nor was this reference inadvertent. The first point of criticism in that piece was her membership in California Women Lawyers, which is criticized for supporting parental leave legislation. 
Senator Feinstein posed the question whether Margaret Morrow was held to a different standard than men nominees. That is a question that has troubled me throughout this process. I was likewise concerned to see that of the 14 nominees left pending at the end of last year whose nominations had been pending the longest, 12 were women and minority nominees. I did not know, until Senator Kennedy's statement to the Senate earlier this year, that judicial nominees who are women are now four times as likely as men to take over a year to confirm. 
At the same time, I note that Senator Hatch, who supports this nomination, included two women whose nominations have been pending for more than a year and one-half, at last week's Judiciary Committee hearing. I also note that the Senate did vote last month to confirm Judge Ann Aiken to the Oregon District Court. So one of the four article III judges confirmed so far this year was a woman nominee. 
Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good work in this regard should not be punished but commended. 
As part of those efforts Margaret Morrow gave a speech at a Women in the Law Conference in April 1994. That speech was later reprinted in a law review. Critics have seized upon a phrase or two from that speech, ripped them out of context and contended that they show Margaret Morrow would be an unprincipled judicial activist. They are wrong. Their argument was refuted by Ms. Morrow in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee. 
This criticism merely demonstrates the critics own indifference to the setting and context of the speech and its meaning for women who have worked so hard to achieve success in the legal profession. Her speech was about how the bar is begrudgingly adjusting to women in the legal profession. How telling that critics would fasten on that particular speech on women in the law and see it as something to criticize. 
Margaret Morrow spoke then about `the struggles and successes' of women practices law and `the challenges which continue to face us day to day in the 1990s.' Margaret Morrow has met every challenge. In the course of this confirmation, she has been forced to run a gauntlet. She has endured false charges and unfounded criticism. Her demeanor and dignity have never wavered. She has, again, been called upon to be a role model. 
The President of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the President of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the President of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They wrote that: `Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties.' She `is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.' I could not agree more.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Ashcroft feels strongly about the validity of citizen initiatives. So do I. So does Margaret Morrow. As she explained to the Committee when she testified and reiterated in response to written questions, she fully respects and honors voters choice. 
Ms. Morrow has explained to the Committee that she is not anti-initiative in spite of what some would have us believe. In response to written questions, she discussed an article she wrote in 1988 and explained, in pertinent part: 
My goal was not to eliminate the need for initiatives. Rather, I was proposing ways to strengthen the initiative process by making it more efficient and less costly, so that it could better serve the purpose for which it was originally intended. At the same time, I was suggesting measures to increase the Legislature's willingness to address issues of concern to ordinary citizens regardless of the views of special interests or campaign contributors. I do not believe these goals are inconsistent. 
. . . . The reasons that led Governor Johnson to create the initiative process in 1911 are still valid today, and it remains an important aspect of our democratic form of government. 
Does this sound like someone who is anti-democratic? No objective evaluation of the record can yield the conclusion that she is anti-initiative. No fair reading of her 1988 article even suggests that. 
After the November 1988 elections in California, she was writing in the aftermath of five competing and conflicting ballot measures on the most recent California ballot. They had been placed there by competing industry groups, the insurance industry and lawyers each had their favorites, and each group spent large sums of money on political advertising campaigns to try to persuade voters to back their version of car insurance restructuring. It was chaotic and confusing for commentators and voters alike. 
Rather than throw up her hands, Margaret Morrow wrote in a bar magazine as President of a local bar association that lawyers could contribute their skills to make the process more easily understood by those voters participation is limited to reading the ballot measures and descriptions and voting. 
Her concerns were not unlike those of our colleague from Arizona, who proclaimed last year that when the voters of Arizona adopted a state ballot measure to allow medical use of marijuana, they had been duped and deceived. Indeed, Senator Kyl criticized that ballot initiative passed by the voters of Arizona during the last election and said: `I believe most of them were deceived, and deliberately so, by the sponsors of this proposition.' 
Senator Kyl proceeded at a December 2, 1996 Judiciary Committee hearing to focus on the official description of the proposition on the Arizona ballot as misleading. His approach was similar to what the majority did on the 9th Circuit panel that initially held the California term limits initiative unconstitutional, but that does not make Senator Kyl a `liberal judicial activist.' 
I also recall complaints from conservative quarters when the people of Houston reaffirmed their commitment to affirmative action in a ballot measure last fall. They complained that the voters in Houston had been deceived by the wording of the ballot measure. 
There have been problems with citizen initiatives and the campaigns that they engender. But that problem is not with Margaret Morrow or her commitment to honor the will of the voters. The problem is that they are being utilized in ever increasing number to circumvent the legislature and the people's will as expressed through their democratically-elected representatives. They are no longer the town meeting democracy that we enjoy in New England but the glitzy, Madison Avenue, poll-driven campaigns of big money and special interest politics. 
Margaret Morrow was right when she pointed out that these measures, their ballot descriptions and their advertising campaigns ought to be better, more instructive, more clearly written. The thrust of that now-controversial article was that lawyers should contribute their skills better to draft the measures so that once adopted they are clear and controlling, so that they are not followed by court challenges during which courts are faced with difficult conflicts over how to interpret and implement the will of the people. 
We know how hard it is to write laws in a way that they are binding and leave little room for misinterpretation. With all the staff and legislative counsels, and legal counsels and specially-trained legislative drafters and Congressional Research Service and hearings and vetting and comments from Executive Branch departments and highly-skilled and experienced and highly-paid lobbyists, Congress has a difficult time writing plain English and passing clear law. Were it not for the administrative agencies and supplemental regulatory processes even more of our work product would be the target of legal actions by those who lost the legislative battle over each contested point. 
For those who preach unfettered allegiance to initiatives, I commend their rhetoric but note that it does not advance us. The questions in most of the subsequent legal challenges to voter-passed ballot measures are either what does it mean or was it passed fairly. Both those questions are premised on an acceptance of the will of the voters. 
For example, the first challenge to the California term limits initiative was not that in Federal court that resulted in the split opinion by a panel of the Ninth Circuit that is later reversed. No, the earlier challenge was in the state courts and reached the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court was required to determine, what did the ballot measure say, was it written to be a lifetime ban or a limit on the number of consecutive terms that could be served. 
That was not an easy question given the poor drafting of the measure and the official materials that described it to the voters. Indeed, the California Attorney General, a conservative Republican, argued that the measure meant only to be a limit on the number of consecutive terms. After three levels of state court proceedings and months and months and hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees the case was decided by a split decision of the California Supreme Court. 
The Federal challenge to the statute followed on the alternative ground that the voters were not clearly informed what the measure meant. This is only important for those who cherish the will of the voter and want to protect against voter fraud. 
On citizen initiatives, Margaret Morrow has told the Committee: 
I support citizen initiatives, and believe they are an important aspect of our democratic form of government. . . . 
I believe the citizen initiative process is clearly constitutional. I also recognize and support the doctrine established in case law that initiative measures are presumptively constitutional, and strongly agree with [the] statement that initiative measures that are constitutional and properly drafted should not be overturned or enjoined by the courts. 
Contrary to the impression some are seeking to create about her views, she told the Committee:  
In passing on the legality of initiative measures, judges should apply the law, not substitute their personal opinion of matters of public policy for the opinion of the electorate. 
I am disappointed to see that some have sought to make the nomination of Margaret Morrow into a vote about guns; it is not. During two years of consideration by the Judiciary Committee and through two sets of hearings and waves of written questions, no one even asked Ms. Morrow about guns. 
Nonetheless, some who have sought to find a reason to oppose Ms. Morrow have fastened upon a few phrases taken out of context from a National Law Journal article from October 1993 that discussed the 67th California State Bar conference. This meeting followed the July 1993 killings in the San Francisco offices of the law firm of Pettit & Martin. 
The National Law Journal's report notes that the representatives of the local voluntary bars considered 100-plus resolutions for referral to the State Bar's Board of Governors. The fact missed by those who are seeking to criticize this nominee is that the State Bar took no anti-gun action. 
The National Journal report noted that the widow of one of the victims pleaded at a reception that the convention `take action on gun control.' What has gone unrecognized is that in spite of the emotional rhetoric at the conference, the California State Bar took no such action. Instead, mindful of the legal constraints on bar associations and the United States Supreme Court decision in Keller v. State Bar, the conference scaled back anti-gun resolutions. A resolution calling for a ban on semiautomatic handguns from the San Francisco delegation was reworded as a safety measure for judges, other court personnel and lawyers. A resolution from the Santa Clara delegation was turned into a mere call for a study. 
The Chairwoman of the conference was not Margaret Morrow but Pauline Weaver of Oakland. Margaret Morrow was not installed as the new President of the California State Bar until the end. 
Ms. Morrow told the National Law Journal that the bar should act like a client and do what is right by following the legal advice of its lawyers. That is what the California State Bar did under Margaret Morrow. In fact, and this is the key fact missed by those who seek to criticize Ms. Morrow, the California State Bar followed the law as declared by the United States Supreme Court and did not take action on gun control. 
Mindful of the strictures of law, Margaret Morrow appointed a special committee of the Board of Governors to review the resolutions that had been recommended at the conference. Based on the recommendations of that committee, the Board of Governors of the California State Bar did not take a stand on gun control and did not even adopt the resolutions passed at the State conference. 
This is hardly a basis on which to oppose this outstanding nominee. First, she was not involved in the efforts by some to push gun control resolutions through the State Bar, following the horrific killings in the San Francisco law offices a few months before. Second, she was not installed as the President of the State Bar until the end of the conference. Third, the actions she took as President were essentially to make sure the Board of Governors understood the law and the limits on what they could do. 
So, in spite of the emotional plea by victims and the desires of certain activists, the California State Bar did not adopt gun control resolutions in 1994 and did not act to use mandatory dues for political activities. Far from demonstrating that she would be a judicial activist or is anti-gun, these facts show how constrained Margaret Morrow was in making sure the law was followed and everyone's rights were respected. 
I grew up hunting and fishing in the Vermont outdoors and I enjoy using firearms on the range. I believe in the rights of all Americans to use and enjoy firearms if they so desire. I voted against the Brady bill and other unconstitutional anti-gun proposals. I have no reason to think that Margaret Morrow will judicially impose burdens on gun ownership. 
I urge others to review the facts. I am confident that they will come to the same conclusion that I have with respect to the nomination of Margaret Morrow and the lack of any basis to conclude that she is anti-gun.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that Senators Ashcroft and Sessions have not challenged Ms. Morrow's truthfulness before the Committee. At their press conference last fall announcing their opposition to her nomination, they were careful to avoid such personal attacks. Instead, they based their conclusions on her writings. I disagree with them and agree with those who read those writings in context. That is a disagreement, we draw different conclusions from the same words. That is understandable. 
What I do not understand is how anyone can continue to repeat the claim that Ms. Morrow was not truthful with the Committee. She was required to answer more litmus test questions and was more forthcoming than any nominee I can remember. 
Some have made the confirmation process into an adversary process. Ms. Morrow is not paranoid; someone has been out to get her. 
In this difficult context, in which the Morrow nomination was targeted by forces opposing the filling of judicial vacancies, charges against Ms. Morrow's integrity and character remain out of line and unfounded. Unfortunately, I have heard repeated over the last day the charge that Ms. Morrow provided a false answer to a written question propounded at the Committee. That is incorrect. 
While I will not take the Senate's time to refute all of the unfounded arguments that have been used in opposition to this nomination, I do want to clear up the record on this. This is a matter of honor and honesty. I do not want the record left unchallenged should her son, Patrick, come to read it someday. 
The written questions propounded long after the Committee deadline following the March 18, 1997 hearing included the following: `Are there any initiatives in California in the last decade which you have supported? If so, why? Are there any initiatives in California in the last decade you have opposed? If so, why?" 
On April 4, the nominee responded in writing noting: 
I have not publicly supported or opposed any initiative measure in the past decade, with one exception.' The nominee proceeded in her answer to describe her participation as a member of the Los Angeles County Bar Association Board of Trustees in a unanimous vote authorizing the Association to oppose a measure sponsored by Lyndon LaRouche concerning AIDS, a measure that was also opposed by Governor Deukmejian and many others. 
I raised objection to these questions at a meeting of the Committee on April 17 because I saw them as asking how Ms. Morrow voted on the more than 150 initiatives that Californians had considered over the last 10 years. Later, the Senator who submitted these questions indicated that he did not intend to ask how the nominee voted and he revised the questions. When he did, he resubmitted another set of supplemental written questions to the nominee on April 21, he acknowledged that 160 initiatives have been on the ballot in California in the last 10 years and he disavowed any interest whether or not the nominee voted on the initiatives but asked for `comment' on a list of initiatives. 
Some have come to contend that the portion of the answer about public support or opposition to initiatives was `intentionally or unintentionally' not truthful information. Their supposed `smoking gun' is a November 1988 article in the Los Angeles Lawyer magazine. What this contention about dishonesty ignores is that the nominee had previously furnished the Committee with the November 1988 article and that article had been inquired about at the March 18 hearing and in the follow up written questions. In fact, the written questions that included the ones at issue contained quotes from the article and questions specifically about it. Thus, no one can seriously contend that this article was unknown to the Committee or that the nominee had failed to disclose it. 
Equally important, and the reason I suspect that the nominee did not refer to the article in her written response to the questions in issue, was that the article was not relevant to these particular questions. Preceding questions had inquired about the meaning of the article. The questions in issue ask about support or opposition for initiatives and appear to inquire about such support or opposition for initiatives in the course of their being considered by voters in California. 
By contrast, the article concerned measures that had already been acted upon by the voters of California, including one that had been considered two years previously. They were not support for or opposition to these initiatives, as the nominee, or, for that matter as I, understood those questions. They were commentary after the fact by way of comment upon the growing resort to initiatives in California and ways lawyers might help to improve the initiative process and the drafting and consideration of initiatives as well as a call for the State legislature to function more efficiently. 
Indeed, when the author of those questions received the initial answer, he did not question that it was untruthful or feign ignorance of the November 1988 article. Instead, when he revised and resubmitted supplemental questions he prefaced his revised question by noting that he was aware of the nominee's `public comments regarding citizen initiatives.' 
Thus, no one can fairly believe that this nominee's answer was incomplete or deceptive for having failed to include express reference to an article that was not advocating in favor or in opposition to a pending initiative and about which the questioner had knowledge, had already specifically inquired and on which the questioner promptly professed knowledge. 
Stripped of the rhetoric and hyperbole, there is simply no basis to contend that this nominee mislead the Committee by her answer. This is no basis to question her candor. Any purported `major misstatement of fact' is not that of this nominee but would be of those who accuse her of a lack of honesty or candor. 
No fair and objective evaluation of the record can yield the conclusion that she is anti-initiative. No fair reading of her statements suggests a basis for any such assertion.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Utah will stay on the floor for a moment on this, I know there are a number of Senators, especially the two distinguished Senators from Pennsylvania, and others who wish to speak. I advise Senators that I am only going to hold the floor for a moment. 
I would like to underscore something that the distinguished Senator from Utah said, which is that if this matter does not come to a vote in the next couple of days and stays on the calendar during that time, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has the authority to hold further hearings, if he wishes to, even though the matter is here pending on the calendar. It is something that can be done without the direction one way or the other from the Senate as a body. 
I would also note that the distinguished chairman and I have a long practice of discussing first privately issues of this nature that may come up so that we can then report back to the individual Members on our side of the aisle where we are going. I know that the distinguished Senator from Utah would do that. I mention this only to say that I do not want in any way to limit anyone's right to speak, but I will reserve any comments that I might make until after the time I have discussed this matter privately with the Senator from Utah. I will certainly listen to the things that are said by other Senators on the floor. I want to note an agreement with what the Senator from Utah has said, which is, of course, that the committee has the right to hold further hearings while this matter is pending before the Senate. It is not often done. But certainly it could be. 
Mr. President, I am about to suggest the absence of a quorum, and I will assure Senators that I will have no objection to having it called off in about 1 minute. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to add my support to promoting electronic commerce and keeping it free from new Federal, State or local taxes. I am pleased to cosponsor the Internet Tax Freedom Act, S. 442, as it was reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee. 
In ways that are becoming increasingly apparent, the Internet is changing the way we do business. More than 30 million people around the world surf the Net. And more and more of these users turn to the World Wide Web and Internet to place orders with suppliers, sell products and services to customers, communicate with clients and market products. 
This Internet market is growing at a tremendous pace. Over the past two years, sales generated through the Web grew over 5,000%. And according to one Internet research firm, Net merchants are expected to sell $6.6 billion worth of goods by the year 2000. 
The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home state of Vermont. On my home page on the Web, I have put together a section called `Cyber Selling In Vermont,' which is a step-by-step resource guide for exploring on line commerce and other business uses of the Internet. It includes links to businesses in Vermont that are already cyber selling. As of today, this site includes links to Web sites of more than 100 Vermont businesses that are doing business on the Internet, ranging from the Quill Bookstore in Manchester Center to Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse in Newport. 
As electronic commerce continues to grow, I am hopeful that we in Congress will be leaders in developing tax policy to nurture this exciting new market. That is why I have closely followed the Internet Tax Freedom Act since Senator Wyden introduced it last summer. I want to commend the senior Senator from Oregon for his leadership on cyber tax policy. 
During my time in the Senate, I always tried to protect the rights of Vermont state and local legislators to craft their laws free from interference from Washington. Thus, the broad, open-ended moratorium on state and local taxes relating to the Internet in the original bill gave me pause. I certainly agreed with the goal of no new state and local taxation of online commerce, but the means were questionable. 
I believe those questions have been fully answered by the changes made to this legislation during its consideration in the Senate Commerce Committee. I want to commend Senators McCain, Wyden, Burns and Kerry for crafting a substitute bill that protects the free flow of online commerce while accommodating the rights of state and local governments. In particular, I am pleased that the revised legislation adds an end date of January 1, 2004 to the moratorium and clarifies the list of state and local taxes that are grand fathered under it. The addition of state tax organizations to the Presidential task force to develop long-term Internet tax policy also makes good sense. 
Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax Freedom Act to foster the growth of online commerce and will work hard for its swift passage into law.

Mr. LEAHY. 
Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Equal Access to Justice for Taxpayers Act of 1998. I am pleased that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, is joining me as an original sponsor of this important legislation. 
Like so many Americans, I was disgusted by the evidence that surfaced of so many abuses of the IRS at recent hearings by the Senate Finance Committee. I followed the hearings very closely, and I heard taxpayer after taxpayer come before the Finance Committee recounting horror stories and trying to fight against unjustified action by the IRS that cost them thousands of dollars and countless hours of emotional distress. These average taxpayers told of frustration and despair caused by rogue IRS personnel who used the awesome resources of that agency to punish them. 
Probably the saddest part about what we heard was that these good Americans, taxpayers, felt powerless to even question or fight back against their own Government. I believe, as many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle do, that Congress needs to reform the IRS and stop these abuses from ever happening again. 
Unfortunately, current law hamstrings taxpayers who challenge the IRS. Our legislation would change that by giving taxpayers, for the first time ever, a cause of action under the existing Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). Under our bill, taxpayers may exercise their rights under the EAJA to win awards of legal fees, expert witness fees and other costs against the IRS when that agency takes substantially unjustified action against them. Thousands of citizens have won vindication against unjust governmental action under the EAJA, and taxpayers should be able to do the same thing. 
Today, most taxpayers feel that if the IRS comes after them, even if they think it is unjustified, they don't dare fight it because it will cost more in lawyers, accountant fees, and so on. Under our act, if they prove it was unjustified action, the Government pays them for their lawyer fees and for their accountant's fees. This was done by Congress to help individuals, partnerships, and corporations in other administrative actions involving the Government. We should do the same with the IRS. 
In 1981, Congress enacted the EAJA to help individuals, partnerships and corporations seek review of, or to defend against, unjustified governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights in civil actions and in administrative proceedings. The EAJA permits citizens who prevail in these actions in proceedings against federal agencies to recover their costs when the government acted unjustly. Its purpose is to deter abusive actions and overreaching by the government and to enable individuals to vindicate their rights, regardless of their economic circumstances. 
But court decisions have interpreted the EAJA to exempt all civil actions and administrative proceedings in connection with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from its protections. Instead, taxpayers must seek review of, or defend against, unjustified actions by the IRS under provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. These Internal Revenue Code provisions make it much harder for average taxpayers to recover against unjust IRS actions. 
The recent report of National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service agreed that the Internal Revenue Code fails to provide taxpayers with adequate legal rights to recover attorney's fees and other costs against unjust IRS actions. The Commission recently proposed numerous reforms to make the IRS more effective and responsive to taxpayers. I commend Senators Kerrey and Grassley, who served on this bipartisan commission, for introducing legislation to implement many of its recommendations. I am a cosponsor of the IRS reform bill that they have introduced, and I hope the Senate's majority leadership will allow this bill to come to a vote soon to put these taxpayer protections in place as rapidly as possible. 
The Commission's report found that: `While the Taxpayer Bill of Rights legislation made great strides to allow taxpayers to recover damages for IRS malfeasance, current provisions do not provide adequate relief. In addition, there are many cases in which taxpayers are not able to obtain review of IRS actions.' The Commission concluded that: `Congress must provide taxpayers with adequate and reasonable compensation for actual damages incurred for wrongful actions by the IRS.' 
What I am saying is this: If the IRS comes after a taxpayer, and if they use draconian methods in an unjustified action, that not only is the taxpayer going to win but the taxpayer is going to get their costs of defending back. So that at least we are going to have the potential of an equal playing field so that we will not have taxpayers who feel that they are being attacked in an unjustified fashion. We will not have them think, `I will either pay the lawyers or I am going to pay the IRS. I might as well surrender, even though I have done no wrong.' Now they can defend their rights. 
It is time for Congress to heed this advice and give taxpayers the same rights that other citizens now have to seek review of, or to defend against, unjust governmental action. The IRS should be treated like every other federal agency under the law--no better and no worse. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to provide taxpayers with the same rights as all other citizens who are subject to unjust governmental action.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor the twenty-two Vermonters who will be representing our country this week at the XVIIIth Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Perhaps Chris Graff of the Associated Press said it best when he noted in an article that appeared in the Rutland Herald that Vermont produces more than its share of Olympians, `. . . a fact that should surprise no one. There is something about Vermonters and the Vermont spirit that is so keenly associated with the Olympic spirit.' Maybe it is the mix of severe weather, Yankee stubbornness, and that New England work ethic that instills in Vermonters an appreciation for hard work and perseverance. 
Representing Vermont on the U.S. Men's Ice Hockey Team is the now famous John LeClair from St. Albans. LeClair may play professional hockey for the Philadelphia Flyers, but he has never forgotten his roots in the small city of St. Albans. John donates his time and expertise to the people of Franklin County throughout the year. His skill and All-American image have brought civility and a touch of New England neighborliness to the most unlikely of sports. For the first time ever, the National Hockey League is competing in the Olympics. Vermonters are rooting for John LeClair to leave a lasting impression. 
If there is one thing Vermonters excel at it is getting through snow, so it makes sense that Vermont is well represented on the U.S. Olympic Cross Country Ski Teams. Four Vermonters will be on the team; Marc Gilbertson and Laura Wilson of Montpelier, Kerrin Petty from Townshend, and Suzanne King of East Warren. This is Marc's first time as a member of a U.S. national team and I admire his grit in going after his Olympic dream. Laura, Kerrin and Suzanne will bring experience to the women's team and are aiming to show the world what Vermont women are made of. 
The Nordic Combined event has Norwich native Tim Tetreault competing. Tim's parents Tom and Anne will be going to Japan this week to watch their son, who has been skiing since he was five, compete in his third Olympic games. The Freestyle U.S. Ski teams also include four skiers and a head coach from Vermont. Ann Battelle from Williston got hooked on skiing during her years at Champlain Valley Union High School and has never looked back. Jim Moran of Stowe and Evan Dybvig of Turnbridge who have both spent many cold hours conquering the slopes of Stowe, will also be competing. Donna Weinbrecht, another team member, knows well all the steep trails and sharp twists at Killington mountain. The four will be joined by coach Jeff Good from Williston. 
Skiing comes naturally for Vermonters, but add a rifle and you have a sport Vermonters can really get behind! Seven Vermonters will be doing just that on the U.S. Biathlon teams--Dan Westover from Colchester, Robert Rosser of Underhill, Kristina Viljanen-Sabasteanski of Richmond, Deborah Nordyke from Jericho, Kara Salmela of Bolton Valley, Algis Shalna (head coach) from Williston, and Timothy Derrick (assistant Coach) of Jericho. Head Coach Shalna brings with him Olympic experience having competed for the Soviet Union's Gold Medal winning team in the 1984 Winter Olympics. The group has been training at a state-of-the-art Vermont National Guard facility in Jericho--which will be hosting the World Junior Biathlon Championships just after the Olympics. 
New to the Olympics but familiar to Vermont is snowboarding. As the birth place of this sport and home to Jake Burton's renowned snowboard company, it is appropriate that Vermont will be sending three talented competitors as part of the first U.S. Snowboarding Team. Ross Powers from South Londonderry, Ron Chiodi of Rochester, and Betsy Shaw of East Dorset will be traveling to Nagano this week. Ross knows all about travel since snowboarding has taken him all over the world. He will celebrate his nineteenth birthday on February 10th and be joined by his mother, Nancy, in Japan. East Dorset will be cheering for their neighbor, Betsy, who has `surfed' mountains all over the globe but knows the ones in Southern Vermont best. Ron too will bring his Vermont experience at Stratton Mountain with him to the Olympics. 
Also going to Nagano, Japan is Vermonter Kathryn Vigesna Lipke of Belvidere. She will be serving as one of five international jurors who will judge the snow-sculpting competitions. Having lived in the mountains of Belvidere with its snowy peaks and dense woods, Kathryn will make an excellent judge of cold weather beauty. 
I am truly proud of the athletes Vermont is sending to the Olympics. I commend them for their hard work and the example they set for Vermonters and for athletes everywhere, and join all Vermonters in wishing them the best in the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are many reasons to support the nomination of Dr. David Satcher for Surgeon General. An experienced physician, Dr. Satcher has distinguished himself as the Chairman of the Morehouse School of Medicine, the President of the Meharry Medical College, and most recently as the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In recognition of his achievements, Dr. Satcher recently received the Surgeon General's Medallion for significant and noteworthy contributions to the health of the nation. 
Heading an agency with eleven major branches and responsibility for promoting health and preventing disease, injury and premature death is no easy task. Since 1993, Dr. Satcher has met the challenge with initiative, poise and professionalism. Under his direction, the CDC has been instrumental in increasing childhood immunization rates, reducing vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, and improving national and international defenses against food-borne illnesses and infectious diseases. 
Under Dr. Satcher's leadership, the CDC has done its best to respond to the threat that infectious diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, AIDS and malaria pose to Americans and people everywhere. In 1994, the CDC introduced a strategy to improve early disease detection, surveillance and outbreak containment worldwide. The CDC is also developing and implementing new diagnostic tests and prevention guidelines, and providing training, equipment, and supplies for public health personnel and national and international institutions.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senator Campbell and I are introducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, along with Senators D'Amato, Dodd, Hatch, Hollings, Johnson, Kennedy, Reid and Torricelli. I am particularly pleased that the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, is an original cosponsor of this bill. Our bipartisan legislation is intended to save the lives of law enforcement officers across the country by helping state and local law enforcement agencies provide their officers with body armor. 
Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year while serving to protect our citizens. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 30 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
Unfortunately, far too many state and local law enforcement agencies cannot afford to provide every officer in their jurisdictions with the protection of body armor. In fact, the Department of Justice estimates that approximately 150,000 State and local law enforcement officers, nearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor. 
In countless incidents across the country everyday officers sworn to protect the public and enforce the law are in danger. Last year, an horrific incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border underscores the need for the quick passage of this legislation to provide maximum protection to those who protect us. On August 19, 1997, federal, state and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New Hampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. He had shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two other victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with the authorities, Drega was killed. 
During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore bulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For example, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, was seriously wounded in the incident. I am glad that Officer Pfeifer is back on the job after being hospitalized in serious condition. Had it not been for his bulletproof vest, I fear that he and his family might well have paid the ultimate price. 
The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega were not so lucky. We all grieve for them and our hearts go out to their families. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective vests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous officers because of the high-powered assault weapons, but the tragedy underscore the point that all of our law enforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the best protection we can provide, including bulletproof vests. 
With that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law enforcement officers. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 will help by creating a new partnership between the federal government and state and local law enforcement agencies to help save the lives of police officers by providing the resources for each and every law enforcement officer in harm's way to have a bulletproof vest. Our bipartisan bill would create a $25 million matching grant program within the Department of Justice dedicated to helping State and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor. 
In my home State of Vermont, our bill enjoys the strong support of the Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law enforcement officials. Just last week I was honored to be joined by Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, Vermont Commissioner of Public Safety James Walton, Vermont State Police Director John Sinclair, Vermont Fish and Wildlife Lieutenant Robert Rooks, South Burlington Police Chief Lee Graham, South Burlington Vermont Officer Diane Reynolds as we spoke about state and local law enforcement officers' need for body armor. 
Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes to our attention. 
Our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be `routine.' In fact, the National Association of Chiefs of Police just reported that 21 police officers were killed in the line of duty last month, nearly double the toll for the month of January in both 1997 and 1996. More than ever, each and every law enforcement officer across the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest. 
Senator Campbell and I have the support of the Fraternal Order of Police and many other law enforcement groups for this proposal. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and its quick passage into law.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am glad to be here with my good friend from Utah and welcome him back from a productive weekend. 
Last week, I commended the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for scheduling the judicial confirmation hearing, the first of this year, for tomorrow afternoon, and I commend the chairman again. I note that he is following through on his earlier statement by including both Margaret McKeown of Washington State and Susan Oki Mollway of Hawaii at that hearing. They have each been pending for over 18 months, and it will be good to have their confirmation hearing. 
I hope we will maintain pace this year that was established during the last 9 weeks of the last session. In order to do that, I hope that in addition to these nominees we can proceed to confirm additional nominees for article III judicial vacancies before the end of the week. 
I am delighted the Senate is getting the opportunity to consider the nomination of Judge Carlos Moreno to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. He has been strongly supported by both Senators Feinstein and Boxer. They have both spoken to me about him and strongly support him. 
I have spoken often about the District Court of the Central District of California, its workload and the need to confirm qualified nominees for the judicial vacancies that persist and are arising on that Court. I have spoken most often about that Court in connection with the longstanding nomination of Margaret Morrow. It is my expectation that the Senate will fulfill the commitment it made last year and proceed to that nomination by the end of next week. 
Judge Moreno received his undergraduate education at Yale College and his law degree from Stanford Law School. He was a deputy city attorney in Los Angeles, as well as a municipal court judge before joining the Los Angeles Superior Court in 1993. Judge Moreno is currently serving the people of California as a Judge of the California Superior Court. He received high remarks from the American Bar Association and was reported by the Judiciary Committee on November 13, 1997, unanimously. I thank both the majority leader and my good friend from Utah for bringing him up this morning. 
Along with Judge Moreno currently pending on the Senate calendar are Ms. Morrow, two nominees for long-vacant judgeships in Illinois and a Pennsylvania State court judge. I hope that we have a strong bipartisan vote in his favor. 
I also expect that today the Senate will confirm the President's judgment in nominating and reappointing Judge Christine Miller to the Court of Claims. The President's nomination of Judge Miller was received last year before her first term expired, but the Senate failed to act on it before adjournment last fall. 
The President used his recess appointment power to reappoint Judge Miller and resubmitted her nomination. Today the Senate will reaffirm the President's action and confirm her to a full term. 
The Court of Claims is an important court. It is established by Congress under article I of the Constitution. No less than the Federal judiciary that is appointed to fill vacancies in the article III courts that we speak about so often, the vacancies on the Court of Claims should be filled and filled without delay. 
Madam President, I hope that the distinguished Senator from Utah and I will be allowed by our caucuses to move forward on judges as quickly as possible. I know there is support in mine to do that. 
Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from California on the floor and yield to her.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on these judges today, I learned long ago, and certainly have had it reiterated during my 23 years in the Senate, that it is not always wise to predict the outcome of votes. I have been surprised before both pleasantly and unpleasantly. I have been surprised at some I thought might pass and failed to pass, and other times have had a very pleasant surprise to find something did pass when I didn't expect it to. 
I think it is safe to say--and I believe there will be bipartisan consensus on this--that these judges' nominations will pass overwhelmingly, which is usually what happens with a judgeship. 
Starting this year we have proceeded on more judicial nominations in the first couple of weeks this session than we did over the course of the first months last year. 
I hope that we have strong bipartisan votes on these judgeships today. It will signal that the Senate is moving forward and that we will make progress to help fill the vacancies that plague the Federal judiciary. Today, there are 86 vacancies on the Federal courts. After these favorable votes, we will have 54 nominees pending before the Senate in need of our prompt attention. I have spoken with President Clinton on a couple of occasions recently, urging the White House to move quickly in sending up further nominations, and they are. We saw that on the first day that we came back when a dozen new nominations came up. We have 55 nominees pending. Almost two-thirds of the current vacancies have nominees pending to fill them. 
Now I think it is time to say that for whatever reasons--political, ideological or otherwise, for whatever reasons--the Senate went slowly last year on nominations. The distinguished chairman and I want to be allowed by our respective caucuses to move forward, fulfilling our roles as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, to move nominations forward. 
I do not question the integrity of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has worked very hard on this, and has on more than one occasion strongly supported somebody who would not have been his nominee had he been the one appointing; in the same way, I have strongly supported nominees of past Presidents who would not have been mine had I been the person making the nominations. But in both instances, the Senator from Utah and I looked at a man or a woman of high qualifications, of good legal background, perhaps of a different background than our own, but somebody who would serve the interests of justice well, and we have pushed forward for their confirmation. 
I hope, so that the U.S. Senate does not send the wrong image to the Judiciary and to the American people, that we would be able to move forward in the way the Senator from Utah and I have preferred to work in the past and move these judges, vote them in or vote them down. 
I am not suggesting to any Senator how he or she should vote. If they do not like a nominee, vote against that nominee. Give us a chance to vote on them, vote them up or vote them down, but keep the Federal Judiciary out of politics. 
It is, after all, one of the linchpins of our democracy, this great democracy. We are the third most populous country in the world, the most powerful nation on Earth, the most powerful democracy history has ever known. We maintain that power as a democracy and not a totalitarian society. We maintain it largely because of the integrity and independence of our Federal Judiciary. They act as a break on a runaway Executive or a runaway Congress because what they hold is their great shield and great bulwark. The Constitution of the United States is something that stands above all of us, whether as Members of the Congress, the Executive Branch or the Judiciary itself. 
We need their integrity and we need their independence. With it, we guarantee the diversity of thought and the diversity of action that protects our freedoms and our democracy--in this case, the greatest democracy on Earth. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every day we read about bone-chilling atrocities around the world, in Algeria, Colombia, Sri Lanka, and even in Mexico. 
I have always felt relations between the United States and our southern neighbor left a lot to be desired. On the one hand it is a relationship fraught with tensions fueled by illegal immigration, racism, drug trafficking, and a long history of misunderstanding. Yet on the other hand it is a relationship based on friendship and respect, and of many shared interests. 
A traveler to Mexico is immediately struck by the great disparity in the standards of living between our two countries. Millions of Mexico's people, especially members of indigenous groups, live in poverty. If they are lucky they own a piece of land, but rarely enough to support their families. They work from sunrise to nightfall bent over a hoe in the fields, or at some other backbreaking job. They sleep in a house built of scraps of wood and tin with a dirt floor, wash in a polluted stream, live in fear of the police, and do their best to care for half a dozen poorly clothed, hungry children who have little hope of anything better. 
But there is another Mexico. It is one of modern factories, busy cities, a government that is evolving from one-party rule to democracy, and an economy that has been largely state controlled becoming increasingly market-based. It is managed by well-educated professionals who grapple daily with seemingly intractable problems. 
Mexico is, above all, a land of contrasts, and the United States has an enormous stake in Mexico's development. Our economies are increasingly interdependent. Some of our most pressing problems are also Mexico's. No fence, no matter how impenetrable, along our border, will solve those problems, whether they are drugs, other types of crime, infectious diseases, polluted air and water. If we are to combat these threats successfully, we have to work together. 
It is for that reason, Mr. President, that the recent violence in Mexico--in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero and Oaxaca--should be of such concern to both our countries. Last July I spoke on this floor about the situation in Chiapas, and warned that unless the Mexican Government dealt effectively with the causes of the conflict there, renewed violence was likely. My warning, like similar warnings by many others, was ignored. Today I rise to speak again about Chiapas, and the tragic events there shortly before Christmas. But I want to emphasize that Chiapas is representative of a much larger problem in Mexico--as in so many other parts of the world--which can most succinctly be attributed to the widening disparity between the haves and have-nots. 
The brief but dramatic Zapatista uprising in 1994 was the result of centuries of discrimination and mistreatment of indigenous people in Chiapas, a situation largely unknown outside Mexico's borders. That violent outburst shook the nation, and led to talks between the Zapatistas and Mexican authorities which sought to address the underlying causes of the unrest. Those negotiations resulted in the San Andres Accords, but the Mexican Government walked away from that agreement apparently concluding that it was too favorable to the Zapatistas. Whatever hope there was that those negotiations would lead to profound changes in Chiapas had been virtually extinguished by the end of last year. The Mexican Government's attention was focused elsewhere, mostly on the national elections which to its credit were the most free and fair in Mexico's history. 
Meanwhile, Chiapas has remained in an undeclared state of war between the Zapatistas and their sympathizers, and anti-Zapatista paramilitary groups who have been encouraged and supported by local and state authorities. Tens of thousands of Mexican soldiers have also been sent to Chiapas, where they have contributed to the tensions and they have apparently stood by as local officials have armed the paramilitary groups. Caught in the middle are the people of Chiapas. 
Three days before Christmas, Chiapas again exploded in violence. In the village of Acteal, 45 unarmed Indian men, women and children were slaughtered in cold blood by paramilitary forces reportedly with the support of government authorities. Two weeks later, Mexican police fired on a crowd in the town of Ocosingo that was protesting the December 22nd massacre, killing a woman and wounding her 3 year-old daughter and a 17 year-old boy. 
Mr. President, who but the most hate-filled people would carry out such a barbaric deed? The fact that government officials are reputed to have had a role in the slaughter is particularly outrageous. But it should not surprise anyone who knows the history and has followed events in Chiapas. In fact, in the months leading up to the Acteal massacre human rights groups issued report after report describing acts of provocation and violence by paramilitary groups and Mexican soldiers. Members of Congress sent letters of concern to President Zedillo. Yet these reports and letters did not even receive a response. Chiapas was a powder-keg waiting to explode even before the Zapatistas first emerged on the scene in support of indigenous concerns about discrimination, land rights and the lack of social services. What happened in Acteal is only the latest example, albeit a particularly atrocious one, of the kind of brutality that is a fact of daily life for many indigenous people in Chiapas. 
Since then, the Mexican Government has taken several encouraging steps. A federal investigation is ongoing. At least 40 persons suspected of committing the murders have been arrested. State and local officials who allegedly instigated the attack, and who later tried to cover it up, have been arrested or removed from office. The Minister of the Interior has been replaced. The Government of the State of Chiapas freed several hundred prisoners, in an attempt to restart the peace talks. These are important steps. Had the government taken the advice of so many people years ago and treated this situation with the sensitivity and urgency it deserved, this entire debacle might have been avoided and many people might be alive today. 
The situation in Chiapas remains tense. While the recent violence seems to be primarily a result of local and state officials taking the law into their own hands and unpardonable passivity on the part of federal authorities, I also continue to receive reports of provocative acts by Mexican soldiers. It is a situation the United States cannot ignore, both because Mexico's political and economic stability are of great importance to us, and because we have trained and supplied Mexico's security forces for many years. That training and equipment has been provided exclusively to combat the drug trade, but has it always been used for that purpose? Or have US-trained police or soldiers, armed with US-made weapons, also been involved in counter-insurgency operations? Were any of the weapons used by the assailants in Acteal and Ocosingo obtained from the United States--either through the anti-drug assistance program or through commercial sales licensed by the US Government? 
These are not accusations, they are only questions. But they need answers. So far, I am not aware of any evidence that US equipment was used in the Acteal or Ocosingo killings. I hope there is none. It would be totally contrary to the understandings between the Congress and the administration, and between the United States Government and Mexican Government, if our assistance were misused in this way. 
Two years ago I wrote an amendment, which was enacted into law and re-enacted last year, which has become known as the Leahy Human Rights Law. It is quite simple. It says that if the Secretary of State has `credible evidence' that a unit of a security force of a foreign country has committed gross violations of human rights, then we cannot provide assistance to that unit unless the foreign government is taking `effective measures' to bring the responsible individuals to justice. 
Accordingly, I have posed my questions in a letter to our Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Jeffrey Davidow, who I respect and who may become our next Ambassador to Mexico. I have, in that letter, also asked for additional information, such as what assistance we have provided to Mexico's security forces, and which units of those security forces have received our assistance. I have urged the administration to carefully review the evidence to determine if the recent events in Acteal and Ocosingo would trigger the Leahy Law cut-off of assistance. 
I would also urge the administration to examine whether any US weapons, helicopters or other military aircraft which were licensed for sale to Mexico have been used by paramilitary or government security forces in counter-insurgency operations in Chiapas. I further urge the administration not to grant any license applications of this kind until we have a full accounting of these recent incidents. 
Mr. President, Chiapas is not unique. There are countless examples around the world of indigenous groups that are suffering from government neglect and violence. It should also be emphasized that the crisis in Chiapas is a Mexican problem that only the Mexican people can solve. But as their northern neighbor with a long history that links us culturally, politically, and economically as well as geographically, we have, as I have said, many shared interests. And one of those interests is to ensure that human rights are not violated and that the United States is not implicated in those violations. 
President Zedillo has said the investigation of the violence in Chiapas will be carried through to its conclusion. I hope that includes not simply the Acteal and Ocosingo killings, but the activities of paramilitary groups throughout the region. The government also needs to address the plight of the thousands of indigenous people in Chiapas who have fled their homes to escape the paramilitary groups and are living in makeshift camps. They are suffering from acute shortages of drinking water, food and shelter. It is a miserable situation and the sooner they can safely return to their homes the better. 
President Zedillo has also said that he wants to resume negotiations with the Zapatistas. I know this has the support of the US Government. What is lacking, I am afraid, is a clearly defined strategy, or road map, for resolving this conflict. Unless both sides have confidence that such a strategy can lead to an acceptable resolution, it will be only a matter of time before another violent outburst, and more needless deaths.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the global battle against infectious diseases, inaccessibility to safe and effective drugs remains a major obstacle for developing countries. The lack of the public health infrastructure to respond effectively to infectious diseases contributes to widespread and needless suffering. Even where that infrastructure exists, many of the world's poor cannot afford the price of drugs. 
But many disfiguring and debilitating diseases can be prevented at minimal cost--in some cases with just one pill, once a year, for as little as a few cents per dose. Last May, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee heard testimony about the need for pharmaceutical companies and governments to work together to combat infectious diseases around the world. Dr. Gordon Douglas, the President of Merck Vaccines, described the company's success with the donation of its drug, Mectizan, in fighting river blindness. Since 1987, Merck has treated 18 million people, spending $70 million on the program in 1996 alone. While the global elimination of river blindness is not expected until at least 2007, Merck has made an invaluable contribution toward this goal. 
Last November, Congress provided an additional $50 million to strengthen global surveillance and control the spread of infectious diseases. On December 16, 1997, amid alarming reports about the Hong Kong flu, the U.S. Agency for International Development gathered public health experts from around the world to set priorities and develop a U.S. strategy to support the global campaign against infectious diseases. And then on January 26, 1998, Smithkline Beecham, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, announced that it was taking on elephantiasis, one of the world's most disabling and disfiguring tropical diseases which afflicts some 120 million people, and endangers as many as one billion people. Smithkline Beecham has generously agreed to provide for free an anti-parasitic drug called Albendazole to combat this scourge. The company estimates that it will spend some $500 million over the next two decades working with the World Health Organization to tackle elephantiasis in parts of Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Central and South America. Over time, the effort could even lead to the eventual elimination of this horrible disease. In addition to protecting against elephantiasis, it is predicted that the yearly distribution of Albendazole will improve the health of millions of children who suffer from chronic intestinal parasites. 
Mr. President, Merck and Smithkline deserve our praise and gratitude. This kind of cooperative initiative between governments and private industry is a model for how we can combat infectious diseases in the years ahead, and in doing so make life better for millions and millions of people.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, few weeks pass when there is not a report of an appalling atrocity in Algeria. The testimony of eyewitnesses echo the same refrain--a tale of slaughter, decapitation, mutilation, burning, and shooting of innocent men, women, and children. Thousands of civilians have fled their homes as the violence has escalated, but the protection and safety they seek is difficult, if not impossible to find. 
The reaction of the international community has not been one of outrage and alarm, but a quiet, almost uneasy expression of concern. It is almost as though the reports are too grisly, too horrific to even broach--as though by addressing the subject and opening it up to scrutiny, one will somehow be tainted by the extreme levels of violence and degradation. However, the subject must be addressed and a credible investigation must be carried out. 
Time and again around the world, we have seen the needless suffering that occurs when governments and the world community as a whole are too slow to shoulder their mantle of moral responsibility. The crisis in Algeria presents another opportunity to change this pattern and set a new standard for the next century.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this month marks the 22nd year the United States has celebrated Black History Month. I want to take this opportunity to mark a relevant piece of Senate history. I am proud to serve with Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and to have served with Edward Brooke of Massachusetts. These outstanding Senators and African Americans are well known and recognized by those who follow the Senate. But today, I also want to recognize McKinley Wise. 
Twenty years ago this month, McKinley Wise was asked to work in the office of the Official Reporters of Debates and in March 1978 became the first African American to stand on the Senate floor and record the words of this body. 
I was privileged to be a Member of the Senate at that time, and I know that this happened not because there was a quota to be achieved but because McKinley Wise's ability qualified him to work on the floor of the Senate. 
In 1978, the Senate was beginning its debate on the Panama Canal treaties. Because this was such an important debate and all Senators were expected to participate, the Chief of the Official Reporters of Debate expected long hours and knew that they were going to need more staff. G. Russell Walker, the chief reporter at the time, set out to find qualified people to work part time and help record the Senate's debate. One of those people he recruited was McKinley Wise. Here's how Mr. Walker explained how Mr. Wise's name came to his attention: 
We had before the Senate in late January the Panama Canal Treaties, and there was a very good possibility of the Senate's having 12- and 14-hour-a-day sessions, and we needed more reporters. I went through our file and saw McKinley Wise's name. He was well qualified, had all the certificates, and seemed to have a good background. I asked for and received authority to call him, to see if he could come down and assist us. It was on Friday, February 24th, when I called him and asked him if he could come in the following Tuesday. Not many reporters could leave their businesses and come to Washington on such short notice, but Mac was there, and he did a magnificent job. 
Mr. President, I remember that very well. And we did have those 12- and 14-hour and sometimes longer days. But he was there.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I bring this to the attention of the Senate to highlight not only this moment in the Senate's history, but also to note that qualifications and hard work do count. Although no longer working for the Senate, McKinley Wise has continued to use his skills over the past 20 years and is currently working in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We spend a lot of time in the Senate talking about opportunity and providing every American the same chance at life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hard work is the key to success, but people need the opportunity to perform. The Senate gave that opportunity to Mac Wise in 1978, and both are better for it.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend the President of the United States on his budget submission to Congress. For the first time since 1971, a President has proposed a balanced budget. I hope and believe that this Congress will be the first in almost 30 years, since 1969, to enact a balanced budget without sacrificing our educational, environmental, health care and law enforcement priorities. 
The President noted in his State of the Union speech last week, two historic pieces of legislation have reduced the deficit to the point where a balanced budget is now within our grasp: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I am proud to have voted for both of these historic laws. 
When President Clinton took office, the deficit was at its highest point ever: $290 billion. But he decided to tackle the runaway deficits of previous administrations. In 1993, the Senate and House of Representatives passed President Clinton's economic plan by the slimmest of margins and without a single Republican vote. 
That was a tough vote around here, but it was the right thing to do. I am proud that I voted for it. It reduced the deficit by 75 percent. Unfortunately, we were forced to make this historic deficit correction without the help of a single Republican vote in either the House or the Senate. 
Last year, Democrats and Republicans together made additional deficit reduction progress by passing the bipartisan budget agreement to reach balance by 2002. 
That package included net savings of more than $900 billion over the next ten years. It also secured and strengthened Medicare for our seniors and made the largest investment ever in education for our children. 
Today, the deficit is at its lowest dollar figure since 1970--$5 billion--and at its lowest point as a percentage of the economy in 30 years. This past year, the Gross Domestic Product grew at its highest rate since 1988, unemployment fell to a 24-year low, and inflation dropped to levels last seen in the 1960s. Our economy is in the best shape in a generation in no small part because of these two historic deficit reduction measures. 
I am most proud that the President and Congress can achieve a balanced budget this year without demeaning the fundamental charter of our democracy, the Constitution of the United States. The proposed constitutional amendment to require a so-called balanced budget did not reduce the deficit by a single dollar or move us one inch closer to achieving those goals. Rather, it was a political exercise serving only to delay and distract--a display in bumper sticker politics. 
I hope the Senate will learn from this lesson and abandon such destructive efforts for illusionary quick-fixes by constitutional amendment for the rest of this session and into the future. 
Instead, Congress working with the President can do the job today. 
Hard choices and bipartisan cooperation are what is needed. We cannot legislate political courage and responsibility. No amendment to the Constitution can supply the people's representatives with these essential attributes. 
Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us achieve remarkable deficit reduction over the past six years. We have succeeded in reducing the deficit every year of the past six. We have cut the deficit by more than 98 percent in that time while pursuing sound economic and strong fiscal policies. 
Now we need to stay the course and work in a bipartisan way to finally balance the budget. We should now be focusing our attention and energies on the strenuous tasks of building a working consensus on budget priorities and achieving agreement on how to balance the budget. 
Within a balanced budget, we must reach consensus on strong support for education funding as one of our top priorities. As I watched my colleagues during the State of the Union address, I noticed that those with school-aged children cheered the loudest at the President's continuing commitment to keep education a national priority. A national commitment to education, however, is not just for the students and parents of today; it is for all of us. 
Only a few decades ago, our students were taught that the countries blessed with the most natural resources held the keys to the highest standards of living and the most vibrant economic growth. Today, it is the countries that invest in their `human capital' that have the greatest success in the global economy. 
I applaud the President for investing in our people by making a higher priority of education at all levels--from an expansion of Head Start, to access to affordable quality child care, to more teachers in the classroom, to literacy training, to lower fees for college students using loans. 
The only way to keep our nation strong and successful in the global marketplace is through an educated workforce. To do this children must understand the basics, the three R's. We need to make sure that teachers are trained and have access to continuing training education. Only after this foundation is built will computers and other technologies in the classroom help students reach their full potential. 
Technology in the classroom can be a great leveler. On the Internet students can see Michelangelo's work on ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in wonderful detail. Students in the United States can `chat' with students in Japan or South America or even their U.S. senator about their daily lives to better understand one another. 
Another great leveler is to ensure that students of all abilities have access to quality education. To this end, I am committed to increasing federal funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). More than two decades ago the federal government made a commitment to local school districts to provide assistance in this funding, and the federal government has not lived up to its end of the bargain. I am disappointed that the budget did not include an increase for this program. I am committed to working with my colleagues as we move through the budget and appropriations process to remedy this shortfall. 
I also find room for improvement with the Administration's proposal for Amtrak. Last year was a critical one for our national passenger railroad. Included in the Taxpayer's Relief Act was a one-time, $2.3 billion infusion of capital, intended to modernize Amtrak and enable it to reap sufficient revenues to become self-sufficient. Congress also passed a far-reaching Amtrak Reform Bill, which will refine the way Amtrak does business for the 21st Century, while making sure that its employees are fairly treated. I am disappointed that the Administration has proposed using a portion of these capital funds, instead, for Amtrak's day-to-day operating costs. This would undermine Amtrak's modernization plan and all of the hard work we did last year on these proposals. As always, I will work with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to try to find ways to ensure that Amtrak receives the resources it needs. 
Mr. President, on balance, the President has proposed a budget that reflects priorities that are good for the nation and that will find strong support by the American people. I am delighted that the President and Congress can achieve a balanced budget this year while serving the needs of the nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact the first balanced budget in a generation.  
Mr. President, I see nobody else seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will make a new year's resolution to focus its energy on issues that create American jobs, protect American ingenuity, and improve the lives of the American people. I was disappointed last year that we wasted so much of the Senate's limited time on partisan and divisive issues. 
This year the Senate should be in the business of doing America's business. We should be working in a bipartisan manner to enact copyright term extension legislation so that America's trading partners will recognize American copyrighted works for the same term that those countries grant their own national works. We should be passing encryption legislation to allow American hi-tech companies the freedom to compete vigorously in the global marketplace. We should be enacting patent reform legislation to help American innovators, big and small. 
High on the Senate's agenda for doing America's business should be ratifying the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties and enacting WIPO implementing legislation. To this end, I would like to take a few moments to discuss why we should care about these WIPO treaties, how America will benefit when we ratify these treaties, and how we can get the job done.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator Dodd's legislation, the `Cuban Women and Children Humanitarian Relief Act.' 
This bill, which is long overdue, authorizes the President to permit the sale of food, medicine, and medical equipment to the Cuban people. One would think that this would not be necessary. The United States has a long history of providing humanitarian assistance to needy people even when we differ with their government. North Korea is an example. Yet, because of our obsessive antipathy toward Fidel Castro, we have applied a different standard to Cuba. Unfortunately, it is the Cuban people who have suffered as a result, not their government. In fact, it has given Fidel Castro a convenient excuse to blame the United States for whatever goes wrong there. 
The American Association for World Health reports that malnutrition, deterioration of water quality, and serious deficiencies in medicines, equipment and medical information have resulted from American restrictions severely limit the sale of medicines they actually prohibit the sale of food. Not even the sanctions against Libya, Iran, and Iraq contain such extreme measures. This outright ban on food has been especially harmful to women and children, contributing to nutritional deficits among pregnant women and low birth-weight babies, as well as a high incidence of neurological disease. 
I have long believed that the way to encourage democratic reforms and respect for human rights in Cuba is not through isolation of this tiny island nation, but through the normalization of our relationship by relaxing the embargo. One would think that after thirty-seven years, with Castro still in power, we would try another approach. Many Americans share this view. Over $60 million in medicine and medical supplies have been donated by U.S. citizens over the past five years. Unfortunately, this great display of generosity represents only a tiny portion of the over $400 million in medicines and food that Cuba imported from the United States prior to the passage of the restrictive 1992 Cuban Democracy Act. 
I urge all Members of Congress to reconsider the reasons behind our embargo against Cuba. The Cold War ended years ago. Easing the restrictions on the sale and donation of medicines and food to Cuba will not, in any way, compromise our nation's security. While Pope John Paul's visit may not signal a political change in Cuba, it does illustrate a new opening by the Castro regime for religious expression that the United States should encourage. Passage of the Cuban Women and Children Humanitarian Relief Act would not only ease the suffering of the Cuban population, it would reaffirm to the world that the United States is the humanitarian nation we hold ourselves out to be.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about juvenile crime legislation pending before the Senate. The `Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act,' S.10, was reported by the Judiciary Committee last year and may be among the bills we consider early in this session. While the measure was improved during the course of the Judiciary Committee markup, unfortunately, as explained more fully in the minority views to the Committee report, there is much work that still needs to be done and much that still needs to be improved. 
The bill reported by the Committee to the Senate would mandate massive changes in the juvenile justice systems in each of our States, and would allow an influx of juvenile cases in Federal courts around the country. The repercussions of this legislation would be severe for any State seeking federal juvenile justice assistance. 
I look forward to the Senate taking up these matters and to a full and open debate on exactly what this bill will do. Those aspects that will do more harm than good ought to be rejected. Those aspects that can be improved, should be. Those aspects that fail to respect the role and judgment of the States, their legislatures and their people ought be changed. This can only be done if the Senate is willing to do the work still unfinished and do so in our greatest tradition of full, fair and open debate. 
Washington Does Not Know Best. I am very concerned about the stringent mandates with which States must comply before they qualify for the $500 million per year in new funding under S.10. This new block grant program sounds great until you look closely. The extensive new requirements created by this program make this money inaccessible to the States. In fact, no State currently qualifies for the new grant money. Consequently, while this bill is touted as helping the nation's juvenile justice systems, States that accept the help will have to surrender their State legislative judgment and change their laws to comport with Washington mandates. 
For example, to qualify for this new source of funds, States would have to change their laws to ensure, for example, that they make accessible to the FBI all juvenile disposition or adjudication records, whether the juvenile was brought in for shoplifting, graffiti or more serious felonies. In addition, the States must make sure they make those records available, not only to elementary or high schools in which the juvenile is enrolled, but also to any college to which the juvenile may later apply. Many of our home States will find these requirements too intrusive and costly to make it worth their while to change their laws. 
We Should Avoid the `Federalization' of Juvenile Crime. By imposing on the States a one-size-fits-all approach to juvenile crime, this bill turns federalism on its head. As reported, S.10 would repeal the presumption in current Federal law that the State has primary responsibility for dealing with juvenile offenders. Changing that presumption to get the federal government and the federal courts involved is neither necessary nor wise. 
Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts have expressed serious concerns about the efforts in S.10 to shift juveniles to the federal court system. As the Chief Justice noted in his 1997 Year-End Report:  
The Judicial Conference of the United States has raised concerns about legislation pending in Congress to `federalize' certain juvenile crimes, maintaining its longstanding position that federal prosecutions should be limited to those offenses that cannot or should not be prosecuted in state courts. 
The Chief Justice clearly recognizes what so many other law enforcement and court personnel know: The federal courts are not equipped to handle the expected increase in federal juvenile cases if S.10 is not modified. 
We should preserve the core protections for juveniles in custody. Regrettably, S.10 would gut the core protections that have been in place for over 20 years to protect children who come in contact with the criminal justice system and to keep abused, neglected and mistreated children out of detention altogether. Every Vermonter who has contacted me about this issue has said the same thing: dismantling these core protections is an ill-conceived move. 
Back-sliding on the protections against putting children in adult jails flies in the face of research showing that children who spend time around bad influences, like adult criminals, have a higher recidivism rate. The co-chair of Vermont's Children and Family Council for Prevention Programs has explained: `If even intermittent contact is allowed, youth will certainly learn more and better ways to act out inappropriately and aggressively.' 
We should focus on prevention. Right now, S.10 lacks balance. The bill is chock full of punitive measures to prosecute and lock-up children, but skimps on efforts to stop children from getting into trouble in the first place. Focusing on the back end of the juvenile justice system--after children get into trouble--is short-sighted. Any police chief or cop-on-the-beat will tell you that. We should also focus efforts on preventing kids from getting into trouble and intervening at the first warning signs before they enter into criminal activity. 
I have heard from numerous law enforcement officials who support a clear earmark for juvenile delinquency prevention programs. They know that prevention programs are key to reducing our Nation's juvenile crime rates. This bill earmarks new federal grant money for a number of enforcement uses, including increasing sanctions, improving juvenile record keeping, mandating drug testing, and juvenile prison construction. No earmark is made for prevention. This is a mistake and will turn out to be a costly one unless we can modify the bill to bring it into balance. If we are going to have earmarks, we must dedicate money for prevention. Prevention programs enhance the skills and competency of troubled juveniles. Such programs help teenagers stay in school and stay out of trouble. Without an earmark, in the competition for dollars, prevention programs will surely lose out. 
I urge my colleagues to talk to the police and prosecutors in their home states. I am confident you will hear, as I have, that well-crafted crime prevention and youth development programs do make a difference. I am also sure that you will hear how critical it is to keep juveniles separate from adult inmates and to allow teenagers who have committed a minor offense a real chance to improve their lives. 
We should work together in an open and bipartisan manner to consider and improve this juvenile crime legislation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken out forcefully on the judicial vacancy crisis that is plaguing our Federal courts. He is correct that: `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the Federal judiciary.' 
Partisan and narrow ideological efforts to impose political litmus tests on judicial nominees and shut down the judiciary have to stop. They hold no place, whether you have a Democrat as President or a Republican as President. The judiciary should not be part of a partisan or ideological power struggle. And I think that all of us as Senators in the most powerful democracy history has ever known have a stake in keeping an independent judiciary. 
Now, we begin 1998 still facing vacancies of about one out of every 10 judgeships. More than a third of these are what are called judicial emergencies. They have been empty for more than a year and a half. Unfortunately, during the last 3 years in the Senate, under the control of my friends across the aisle, the Senate has barely matched the 1-year total of judges confirmed in 1994 when we were on course to end the vacancy gap. 
In the 1996 session, the Senate confirmed only 17 judges, none for the Federal courts of appeals. We began last year with the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court expressing in the year-end 1996 report on the Federal judiciary his `hope' that the Senate would `recognize that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.' 
Through the course of last year, at virtually each meeting of the Judiciary Committee, certainly at each confirmation hearing, and in a number of statements on the Senate floor, I urged the Senate and the Republican leadership and those responsible for holding up much-needed judges to abandon what I saw as ill-advised efforts. 
In July, seven national lawyer organizations spoke out. In August, the Attorney General spoke about the `vacancy crisis that has left so many Americans waiting for justice,' and `the unprecedented slowdown of the confirmation process' and its `very real and very detrimental impacts on all parts of our justice system.' 
Last September, the President of the United States pointed out the dangers of partisan politics infecting the confirmation process. He called upon the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and end `the intimidation, the delay, the shrill voices.' 
In his 1997 year-end report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focused again on the problems of `too few judges and too much work.' He noted the vacancy crisis and the persistence of 26 judiciary emergency vacancies, and he observed: `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee 
vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.' 
Last night in his State of the Union Address the President of the United States again returned to the matter of the vacancy crisis and the need to provide the courts with the judges and other resources they need effectively to administer Federal criminal and civil justice across the country. The President did more than talk yesterday. He also sent us another dozen judicial nominees to help fill the vacancies. That brings to 54 the number of judicial nominees that are pending currently before the Senate. 
The Senate still has pending before it 11 nominees who were first nominated 2 years ago, including five who have been pending since 1995. We are finally going to vote on one of them this afternoon, Judge Ann L. Aiken. 
I see my good friend, the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, in the Chamber. I must say, Mr. President, as much as I like Senator Wyden, it got to the point that I almost hated to see him coming down the hall because he pounded so often on me: `Let's get this fine woman confirmed.' He has been doing this year after year. He has expressed to me and to other Senators and to the leadership of the Judiciary Committee: `Let's get this woman confirmed.' And he has expressed to me how well qualified she is, how superbly qualified she is. He has made his case with passion and with integrity, which is his nature. I say to him, while I am always hesitant to predict any vote, I suspect that she is going to be confirmed overwhelmingly today, and I applaud the Senator for not giving up, I applaud the Senator from Oregon for not giving up all those years that he fought so hard to get her here. I know that both he and the other Senator from Oregon, who is also in the Chamber, Mr. Smith, will be voting for her with great enthusiasm. 
But there remains no excuse for the Senate's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Prof. William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, M. Margaret McKeown, Susan Oki Mollway, Margaret M. Morrow, Clarence J. Sundram, Anabelle Rodriguez, Michael D. Schattman, and Hilda G. Tagle. 
I mention these people because all of these nominees have been waiting at least 18 months, some more than 2 years, for Senate action. 
Last year the Senate confirmed 36 judges, but that has to be seen in relation to the 120 vacancies through the course of the year and the 55 judgeships in addition to the current vacancies that the Judicial Conference urged Congress to authorize in order to meet the workload demand of all of the new laws that we have passed and, of course, a growing country. 
Last year's confirmations did not approach the 58 judges confirmed in the 1995 session or even keep up with the vacancies that came from normal attrition. 
Last year the President sent us 79 judicial nominations. The Senate completed action on fewer than half of them. The percentage of judicial nominees confirmed over the course of last year was lower than for any Congress over the last three decades, possibly any time in our history. Left pending were 42 judicial nominees, including 21 to fill judicial emergencies. 
Last year the Senate never reduced its backlog of pending judicial nominees below 20 and at the end of the year had a backlog of over 40 nominees. With the dozen additional nominees received yesterday, the Senate's backlog of nominees as we begin the year has topped 50. The Administration is demonstrating its resolve to nominate good people to fill these vacancies. 
They are doing their job. 
It is up to the Senate now to do its job. Have the hearings. Vote them up or vote them down. Just don't leave them in limbo. If we don't like the nominee that the President has sent up, then vote him or her down. We are used to voting around here. We can do that very easily. But don't leave them sitting there never knowing what is going to happen. 
In connection with the President's national radio address last September 27, we finally quickened the pace of judicial confirmations, and during the last 9 weeks of the Senate's last session the Senate held five confirmation hearings and confirmed 27 judges. I compliment the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for making that possible. 
In response to the criticism of the Chief Justice, though, the chairman has argued that the Senate is on a steady course and making steady progress. But it was only in the last 9 weeks of the last session that we were able to achieve a pace that can make a difference. I urge my good friend, the chairman--and he is my good friend--to help the Senate maintain that pace this year. 
If we can maintain the same pace we had in the last 9 weeks of the last session, we can end the judicial vacancy crisis that now threatens the administration of justice by our Federal courts. I will commit myself to work with him in any way he wants to do that--have hearings on weekends, hearings in the evening, whatever he chooses--so that we can go forward and maintain the same pace. I compliment the chairman for the pace of those last few weeks. I urge him to do the same for this year. That is the challenge that lies before us as Congress begins anew. 
The Chief Justice compared the past 2 years of Senate inaction to the record of the 1994 session. That was a Democrat-controlled Senate. We worked hard to consider and confirm 101 judges, including a Supreme Court Justice. To make a difference, however, the Senate this year, 1998, need only maintain the pace it reached last fall, 27 judges every 9 weeks. That really should be the measure of the Senate's effort this year. Do what we did at the end of the session last year, do it throughout this year, and we in the Senate can make a difference for the judicial system. 
It will be easy to monitor our progress. Any week in which the Senate does not confirm three judges is a week in which the Senate is failing to address the vacancy crisis. Any fortnight in which we have gone without a judicial confirmation hearing marks 2 weeks in which we are falling farther behind. 
I am delighted that the majority leader and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee have scheduled three nominees for consideration by the Senate today. I thank the majority leader and thank the Senator from Utah for their cooperation and attention to these matters. I look forward to prompt Senate consideration of the other five nominees if they are still pending on the Senate calendar. I would also be willing to bet that most of these nominees would not get even a tiny handful of votes against them and that they are going to pass overwhelmingly. 
I note that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has noticed a judiciary hearing for next week. This notice, and what is happening today, are positive developments. They are signs that the Senate is taking to heart its constitutional duty to consider judicial nominees without further delay. While I hope it does not hurt him on his side of the aisle, I want to commend the Senator from Utah for his actions. I suspect if the two of us were allowed, without any of the political pressures on either side, to work this out, we could probably move ahead more quickly. 
But the warning from the Chief Justice in his year-end report is more than a question of numbers. This is the responsibility every Senator has, Republican or Democrat. Our responsibility first and foremost is to the country, not to individual parties. Our solemn oath is to uphold the Constitution of the United States. That is what should motivate every one of us here. We have to look at this country, the greatest exercise of democracy history has ever seen, the most powerful democracy history has ever known, and 
recognize that it stays that way because of the checks and balances between the legislative, judiciary and executive branches. A hallmark of that has been the independence, throughout our 200-plus year history, of the Federal judiciary. If we allow this to become a partisan football, this confirmation of judges, then the independence and the integrity of the Federal judiciary is being threatened. 
The nominations backlog that perpetuates a judicial vacancies crisis is a function of the targeting of the judicial branch. It was the executive branch that was targeted and shut down 2 years ago. Pressure groups--and it is a fact--within the right wing of the Republican Party have been formed and money has been raised to the cry of `killing' Clinton judicial nominations. That would be just as wrong if the same thing was being done by ideological groups seeking to kill a Republican President's nominations. Constitutional amendments to undercut the independence of the judiciary have been introduced. Ideological impeachments have been threatened. The Republican leadership in the House speaks openly about seeking to `intimidate' Federal judges. 
The confirmation process is not immune from politics, but a particularly virulent strain has now infected this body and has politicized the process to the point of paralysis, and this threatens the integrity and the independence of the judiciary. It encumbers the judicial confirmation process. In too many courts, judges delayed means justice denied. Without judges, courts cannot try cases, they cannot sentence the guilty or cannot resolve civil disputes. 
For more than 200 years a strong and independent Federal judiciary has served as a bulwark against overreaching by the political branches of the Government. It has been the protector of our constitutional rights and liberties. True conservatives should want nothing more than a truly independent judiciary, because it is the bulwark of our individual freedoms. 
I hope this new year will bring the realization by those who have started down this destructive path of attacking the judiciary and stalling the confirmation of qualified nominees to the Federal bench that those efforts do not serve the national interest. I hope we can remove these important matters from partisan, ideological politics. I hope today will move us forward in the interests of the fair administration of justice. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, as I have done many times before on nutrition issues, to introduce a bill that begins the child nutrition reauthorization process. 
For many years on the Committee, when I was Chairman, and later Ranking Member, we always tried to make our nutrition efforts consensus bills--agreed to by all members of the Committee. Now as Ranking Member of the nutrition subcommittee I look forward to working with the Committee to report out a strong child nutrition reauthorization bill. 
The bill I cosponsor today extends existing programs but does not include improvements which I will discuss with other Committee members and the Secretary in the near future. 
Last November, I introduced the `Child Nutrition Initiatives Act' which contained a number of changes that I will discuss with my colleagues. That was not a reauthorization bill but rather an effort that I hope will be carefully looked at by my colleagues in the Senate and in the House. 
I intend to meet with representatives of the various nutrition programs as I work with other Members to help craft a good bill. I look forward to meeting with Under Secretary Shirley Watkins who has a number a great ideas to improve our child nutrition programs. In addition, I will carefully review Senator Johnson's school breakfast bill which has been strongly endorsed by many groups at that national and local level. 
I will also gain input from Vermont nutrition leaders, Vermont program directors, community leaders and program participants. 
My November 13 statement explains the basis for my bill--I am hopeful that many of those provisions will be supported by the Committee and the Senate as a whole.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that we have finally broken the logjam on Ninth Circuit vacancies. Judge Silverman is the first judge to be confirmed to this Court in two years. In the meantime, the Court has been suffering from vacancies amounting to more than one-third of the authorized judgeships for the court and had to cancel over 600 arguments last year. 
I congratulate Judge Silverman and his family and thank Senator Kyl for his cooperation in this effort. I hope that we will move forward promptly to consider the nominations of Judge Richard Paez, Professor William Fletcher, Margaret McKeown and the others needed to staff this important court.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my friend from New Hampshire leaving the floor, and I note that he and I have shared a difficult time in the past few weeks with the ice storms in both of our States. But both New Hampshire and Vermont are coming out well. I know that Maine is now still digging out. They have gone through a terrible time, as have the people in upstate New York, and even the Province of Quebec. I note that throughout all that time, every time I called FEMA, James Lee Witt, or anybody else at the Federal level, the response was instantaneous and effective, and that I appreciate.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to discuss a serious matter. I hesitate to comment on ongoing law enforcement investigations. 
I have always felt that way. 
I am not going to jump into the swirling mix of rumor and revelation and innuendo that has transfixed many in Washington over the last several days. I spent nearly a decade as a prosecutor. I have a very strong sense of what prosecutors should and can do. I am one who has tried to keep any kind of ideological partisanship out of law enforcement decisions. I did that during the time I was a prosecutor, and I have urged that same thing to prosecutors since. 
But I am troubled that the independent counsel law has itself been corrupted and no longer serves its intended purpose. The law was part of a congressional effort to create a mechanism that would reassure the American people that partisanship was not influencing prosecutorial decisions, and that law enforcement judgment was being exercised by those who did not have an ax to grind either way--by those who approached matters from a law enforcement point of view, and not--not--from a lodestone set in a partisan rock. 
I cannot say with confidence that this is the case with the current Whitewater counsel. I look at the continuing and very selective leaks and tactics employed by Mr. Starr's office over the last few years, and particularly over the last few days. And, like so many other Vermonters and so many other Americans, it gives me pause to see these kind of tactics that no prosecutor should ever condone in his or her offices. 
I have seen reports that two weeks ago he was intent on constructing a sting operation to engage the President of the United States in secretly recorded conversations. Have we sunk this low, Mr. President, that we would do things like this? 
I have seen complaints that he sought to pressure a young woman and threaten her mother and father if she did not cooperate in allegations that she was counseled to lie under oath. 
Maybe I am missing something here, Mr. President. But this is a far distance from investigating a decade-old land deal in Arkansas. Having spent more than $30 million of taxpayers' money in what apparently became a self-perpetuating investigation, the goal now seems to go about getting the President by whatever means necessary. 
Last summer I was critical of efforts by Mr. Starr's office to involve itself in allegations of marital infidelity. The justification then to justify the leaks coming out of Mr. Starr's office was that maybe pillow talk might lead to the discovery of some evidence relevant to this decade-old land deal in Arkansas. 
Now it seems that the current activities of Mr. Starr's office seem oddly coordinated to aid in a civil lawsuit against the President. The Paula Jones case has had a gag order on it from the beginning. Yet every single day we find the lawyers and those allied with Ms. Jones selectively leaking depositions and court proceedings to the public. Almost in conjunction--almost in the same package--we see items selectively leaked from Mr. Starr's office with one passing the other. You would think it was the same law firm carrying out this civil case. I have never ever seen a prosecutor do something like that in a State court, a Federal court, or any kind of a case. 
Having been a prosecutor, I have a sense for the enormous power in that office. If you have $30 million to spend you have the most power any prosecutor could ever have. But with that power comes a responsibility. Decisions about what to pursue and what to prosecute are among the weightiest exercises of public authority. Exercised irresponsibly and without accountability the prosecutor's power is easily abused and is left to go towards effectively partisan purposes. 
My point is that at this juncture we need an independent counsel who is clearly removed from partisanship and who can exercise independent judgment. But the country has neither. This is the most partisan, unjustified, demeaning investigation that I can ever remember in my life. Rather than succeed in insulating the power of the prosecutor from abusive partisan purposes, the 
independent counsel law appears to have captured partisan forces. This goes beyond any question of what might have happened in Whitewater or anywhere else. It is the tactics being used. The tactics tend in many ways to become so outrageous that they can only be considered partisan. If you want people to have confidence in the result of an investigation, then the investigation has to be nonpartisan, and it has to be perceived to be nonpartisan so that all people can respect what comes out of it. 
Frankly, Mr. President, from what I am hearing throughout the country, as well as in my own State, people do not expect any idea of impartiality or nonpartisanship from the prosecutor's office. I hope that Mr. Starr will quickly take steps to change that, and will quickly take steps to stop having his office somehow coordinating itself with a civil case, a civil case involving Paula Jones. 
I say this because the country is facing some other issues that also have to be attended to. 
On Friday I flew back to Vermont, as I do so often during the month, and I picked up every newspaper that I could on the way up just to read in the airplane. There on the front page of a major newspaper were all of the stories of what leaks are coming out of the Paula Jones case and what leaks are coming out of Mr. Starr's office. Tucked almost as an afterthought were such stories as this: The Pope making a historic visit to Cuba, with all the ramifications that means; Microsoft's settlement with the Justice Department and implications that is going to have for jobs and consumer protection in the years to come; the Unabomber, who terrorized this country for years, pleads guilty; U.S. forces move to arrest a war criminal, something we have not seen I don't think since the time of Nuremberg; the successive visits by Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to this country and the implications on the peace process for the Middle East. There are other such significant stories: The question of whether we are going to have to go into Iraq and act unilaterally because our allies don't appear to have the guts to stand up to Saddam Hussein. All of these things are tucked back, I say to my colleagues, almost in the fast-food ads in the newspaper. Every one of these things is going to have an enormous effect on your life, on my life, and on the lives of the American people, just as the State of the Union Message will tonight, just as what we do on the floor of the Senate this year. 
These are the things that need debate. I am not suggesting that it is wrong to ask questions about the conduct of anybody--not of me, of you, of the President, or anybody else. I am not suggesting that. But what I am suggesting is let us not forget that we represent the most powerful nation history has ever known and the greatest economy history has ever known, at a time of economic boom. Let us not lose sight of what the American people want us to do in protecting this country. 
But also let us ask--and I asked the same question incidentally during the activities of the special prosecutor in the Reagan era--let us ask whether we undermine the very things we want to protect in this country by allowing a special prosecutor situation to go way out of bounds of what its original aim was--especially when it becomes ideological, partisan, and allied with those who are carrying out civil cases which have nothing to do with the issue initially contemplated by Whitewater. 
Mr. President, I will speak on this more as we go along. I see other Senators who are seeking the floor. I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that we have finally completed action on the fiscal year 1998 foreign operations conference report. I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their support throughout this process, and the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, for his leadership and bipartisanship. The Appropriations Committee is an extraordinary group of people who work together, Republicans and Democrats, like no other committee, and it is a privilege to be part of it. 
The conference report that we are adopting as part of this package today is the product of a year's work and many sleepless nights. Although we finished our conference on all but two issues several weeks ago, it would be an understatement to say that resolving those open issues, especially funding for international family planning, has not been easy. 
There were times when I did not think we would get here. As I have said before, I long for the time when we set aside a day or two each year to debate and vote on abortion--once, twice, 50 times if necessary. It would consume that day or two, but it would be worth it. Then we would not have to revisit the issue time and time again, as we do now for no apparent purpose, only to repeat what has already been said or voted on innumerable times before. It would save a great deal of time, it would give everyone ample opportunity to be counted, and we could spend the rest of the year on other pressing business. I offer that as a suggestion, for what it is worth. 
The agreement we have reached on family planning is not everything that I would like, but that is to be expected. An issue as divisive as this is not going to be resolved in a way that anyone is happy about. The agreement would freeze funding for these programs at last year's level, and limit disbursement to a rate of 8.34 percent per month over the 1998 fiscal year. I would have far preferred the Senate funding level of $435 million, but the cut was part of the price of keeping Mexico City language out of the bill and avoiding a veto. 
The American people should also be aware that the pro-Mexico City faction in the House exacted a heavy price on the administration for its refusal to accept the Mexico City language. The price was that the U.S. contribution to the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow, the previously agreed upon down payment on U.S. arrears to the United Nations, and the authorization for the State Department reorganization, are no longer included. Although these last two are not foreign operations matters, it is outrageous that they were linked to the family planning issue in the first place. There are sound foreign policy reasons for paying our U.N. arrears especially when just yesterday we were petitioning the United Nations for support for sanctions against Iraq. This is the American people's loss, as much as it is the State Department's loss, and I find it incredible that the House leadership would permit this result. It is shortsighted, it is vindictive, and it severely undercuts U.S. leadership around the world. There should be no 
mistake about who bears responsibility. We have a Secretary of State who is deeply respected and admired around the world. She needs our support. It is tragic and inexplicable that because a few dozen House Members did not get their way on an unrelated issue, they have denied her the tools to do her job. I intend to do whatever I can to see that this is corrected at the earliest possible date next year. 
Mr. President, I hope we can avoid repeating again next year the tortuous process that got us here. As long as President Clinton is in the White House, the Mexico City policy is not going to become law. It is time that people in the House accepted that and saved us all the headache of refighting this pointless battle. 
Now that the conference report has been completed I want to take this opportunity to speak on a number of other provisions in it. 
I am very pleased that we have fully funded our commitments, including arrearages, to the World Bank. I will have a separate statement on that because I believe it so important that the World Bank's management and the Treasury Department understand the importance we give to U.S. leadership in the international financial institutions, and our intention that our influence be exerted to achieve significant reforms in a number of critical areas. 
One of the provisions I am especially proud of in the conference report is entitled `Limitation on Assistance to Security Forces,' which has also become known as the Leahy law. This provision expands on current law, which seeks to ensure that U.S. assistance does not go to individuals who abuse human rights. I want to thank Congressman Gilman for his support for this provision. Despite an initial misunderstanding about how the current provision was being applied, I am convinced that he too wants to do everything possible to ensure that in our efforts to support foreign security forces that respect human rights, we also prevent those who abuse human rights from receiving our assistance. 
In order to implement this provision, the State Department has required recipients of our assistance to enter into end-use monitoring agreements, and to ensure that if there is credible evidence that a security force unit that has received our assistance has abused human rights, effective measures are being taken to bring the responsible individuals to justice. These agreements should be routine whether or not the Leahy law were in effect. The kind of measures we expect a foreign government to take to bring those responsible to justice are discussed in the joint statement of the managers accompanying the conference report. We also make clear that we expect our own Government to do everything it can to assist in that effort. 
Mr. President, before I leave this subject I want to mention that while we have seen a decrease in abuses by the Colombian Army, there has been an alarming increase in atrocities attributed to paramilitary forces in that country. We have seen this pattern in other Latin American countries where the armed forces, either actively or passively, supported the clandestine activities of paramilitary forces. I want it to be known that as the author of the Leahy law, I believe it is 
incumbent on the Colombian Army to demonstrate that it is not acting in collusion with the paramilitary groups, or standing by idly as they do their dirty deeds. 
Mr. President, to turn to another subject, the international community rapidly responded with sanctions in the aftermath of the July 1997 coup in Cambodia. According to reports, the suspension of foreign assistance, which constitutes nearly two-thirds of Cambodia's annual revenue, sent a strong message to Hun Sen and his supporters. 
The conference report prohibits most bilateral aid to the Cambodian Government and instructs United States executive directors of the international financial institutions to vote in opposition to loans to Cambodia. The joint statement of the managers also expresses the hope that Hun Sen's political opponents will be allowed to return to Cambodia and safely participate in free and fair elections. 
These measures and others like them have been instituted around the world against the perpetrators of the coup. They are a necessary and important response to those who stand in the way of democracy. Nevertheless, the sanctions directed against Hun Sen and his supporters have also fallen heavily on the shoulders of the Cambodian people. Therefore, the conference report permits humanitarian, demining, and electoral assistance to go forward. One item Congressman Callahan and I had agreed upon but because of an oversight neglected to include in the joint statement of the managers, was a statement that the prohibition on assistance to Cambodia is not intended to preclude basic education programs as long as they are conducted at the local level and not through the central government. During the Khmer Rouge regime most of the country's teachers were killed or forced into exile. A large percentage of the population is illiterate, and we want to continue basic education activities as part of our effort to help the Cambodian people overcome that tragic period. 
Finally, I want to make clear that while we do permit electoral assistance, I would not support significant expenditures in this area unless Hun Sen is demonstrating his commitment to free and fair elections, to the prosecution of individuals implicated in the U.N. human rights investigation of the July 1997 coup, and then only if Hun Sen has made an unequivocal statement that if defeated in a free and fair election he would relinquish power. 
Mr. President, another initiative I am very proud of seeks to enhance U.S. leadership in the global effort to combat the spread of infectious diseases, which also poses a direct threat to the health and welfare of Americans. We include in the conference report sufficient funds to provide an additional $50,000,000 for these activities. The Senate and House foreign operations reports, as well as the joint statement of the managers, describe the rationale for this initiative and the purposes for which we are making these additional funds available. I also intend to solicit the recommendations of AID, the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health, and other agencies, organizations and distinguished individuals, regarding how we can most effectively use these funds to buttress existing efforts in surveillance and control of infectious diseases. 
The Leahy war victims fund has been assisting war victims in over a dozen countries since 1989. I am pleased that the joint statement of the managers recommends up to $7,500,000 for these programs in fiscal year 1998, a $2,500,000 increase over the current level. The fund has been primarily used to assist victims of landmine explosions, a problem that has attracted increasing world attention, but it is also available to support other types of assistance to disabled war victims. This is consistent with the President's September 17 announcement that the administration intends to devote considerably more resources to demining and to assist landmine victims. 
Over the years, the Congress has passed numerous resolutions on the situation in East Timor. Despite international pressure, the Indonesian Government has refused to withdraw its thousands of troops from the island. The situation has remained tense since the 1990 Dili massacre, the anniversary of which coincidentally was yesterday, and arbitrary arrests and disappearances of East Timorese are common. 
Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country and enjoys close economic and security relations with the United States. I would like to see that relationship flourish. But we cannot ignore what happened this past June when supporters of democracy were arrested and killed by Indonesian soldiers, and the main political opponent of the Suharto regime was forced to withdraw from the election, notwithstanding that the election was rigged from the start. Nor can we ignore the abuses in East Timor. I had the honor of meeting East Timorese Bishop Bello earlier this year, and I believe that while we should encourage close relations with Indonesia, we should also do what we can to ensure that we are not contributing to the problems in East Timor. For that reason, a provision I authored was included in the conference report which is designed to prevent United States lethal equipment or helicopters from being used in East Timor. This provision is intended to expand on the administration's current policy of not providing small arms, crowd control items, or armored personnel carriers to Indonesia. It is also consistent with actions taken recently by the British Government. 
There is a provision in the conference report which makes funds available for reconstruction and remedial activities relating to the consequences of conflicts within the Caucasus region. These funds, which will be made available through nongovernmental and international organizations, are very important. Contrary to what some have suggested, we are not providing direct assistance to the authorities in the conflict areas because we do not want to become embroiled in the issues of sovereignty and control that remain unresolved there. However, there are needy people in Nagorno Karabakh and Abkhazia who we want to help recover from the ravages of war. 
Mr. President, I want to mention a couple of other items. The Senate report encourages AID to establish a program of physicians exchanges with the countries of the former Soviet Union, with a focus on the diseases that are major contributors to excess morbidity and mortality and where effective medical intervention is possible. I strongly support this idea and look forward to hearing AID's reactions. 
Also in the Senate report we discuss the alarming incidence of violence against women in Russia. The administration has taken some steps in this area in response to congressional concerns, but I am convinced that far more could be done to tap the experience and knowledge of U.S. police officers and prosecutors who have developed procedures for dealing with domestic violence here. We have requested the State Department, in consultation with the Justice Department, to submit a report on future plans in this area and I strongly encourage them to pursue training programs that bring U.S. and Russian police officers together, preferably in Russia, to address these issues. 
Finally, the conference report requires the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Department of State, to submit a report to the Appropriations Committees describing potential alternative technologies and tactics, and a plan for the development of such alternatives, to protect antitank landmines from tampering in a manner consistent with the Ottawa Treaty, which bans antipersonnel mines. This is very important because if we are ever going to join that treaty, as I believe we must, we need to solve this problem. I am convinced it can be solved. Informed people in the Pentagon say it boils down to preventing tampering with antitank mines that are aerially delivered at remote distances, and then only for a period of 30 minutes which is the difference in time it takes an enemy soldier to disarm or remove an anti-tank mine alone, and one that is protected with antipersonnel mines. Unfortunately, there is an institutional inertia at the Pentagon that stands in the way of solving it. There is little inclination to do so absent an order from above. This report, which we expect to be objective and thorough, is intended to set the stage for such an effort. 
Mr. President, I believe this is among the better foreign operations bills to have passed the Congress in several years. I am disappointed that the U.S. contribution to the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow fell victim to the Mexico City issue, but I am confident that it will be passed on a supplemental appropriations bill next year. It does not score against the budget, and in fact would reduce the burden on the U.S. Treasury in the event the U.S. is needed to help prevent harm to the U.S. economy from an international financial crisis. Why the House did not want that is beyond me.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 927, the Ocean and Coastal Research Revitalization Act of 1997. Last year, Congress passed the National Invasive Species Act. S. 927 will enable colleges and universities across the country to address the goals of the National Invasive Species Act and will foster research on our marine and coastal resources. My amendment to include Lake Champlain as one of the Great lakes will allow Vermont colleges and universities to join the Sea Grant College Program and increase research on the many environmental threats to Lake Champlain. 
A recent study shows that the zebra mussels have spread from 4 States in 1988 to 20 States this year. The zebra mussel is a prime example of what can happen when an exotic species is introduced into an environment where it has no natural predators. The zebra mussel, having hitchhiked over from Europe, is invading the far reaches of Lake Champlain at an alarming rate. 
We Vermonters have come to think of it as great for many reasons though: Lake Champlain is vital both environmentally and economically to Vermont. Lake Champlain supports a watershed of over 8,200 square miles and an economy of over $9 billion in the region. In addition, the importance of Lake Champlain spreads throughout the Northeast, since residents of New England and the mid-Atlantic States cherish the lake and its resources for its recreational, ecological, and scenic values. Although Vermonters have always considered Lake Champlain the sixth Great Lake, this legislation will now officially recognize Lake Champlain as the sixth Great Lake under the Sea Grant Program. 
This designation will allow colleges and universities in the Lake Champlain basin to become a Sea Grant college, enabling them to conduct vital research on the many invasive species threatening Lake Champlain, including zebra mussels, sea lampreys, Eurasian watermilfoil, and water chestnut. Inclusion in the National Sea Grant College Program would allow Vermont schools to focus greater attention on invasive species, but also would help Vermont and New York implement a number of the priorities identified in the Lake Champlain Basin Plan signed by our Governors this winter. 
As the economic importance of the lake and the population of the Champlain Valley has grown, so have the environmental problems of Lake Champlain. One of the main environmental issues facing the lake is controlling pollution that flows into the lake. In particular, increases in the levels of phosphorus have turned parts of Lake Champlain green with algae. Runoff from farms and urban streets and treated water from sewage plants have caused this increase. 
Historically, scientific efforts on Lake Champlain have lagged behind other regions with coastal waters of national significance. Although the University of Vermont was one of the original land grant colleges, it did not receive Sea Grant college status during the initial selections because the Sea Grant Program has been focused on areas with marine research needs. Since that time, several new Sea Grant designations were made to address critical issues facing the Great Lakes. 
Lake Champlain plays an important role in the Great Lakes system, connected by hydrologic, geologic, and biological origins. The issues facing Lake Champlain represent the emerging issues facing the Great Lakes, such as nutrient enrichment, toxic contamination, habitat destruction, and fisheries issues. Allowing Vermont to participate in the Sea Grant Program would provide an opportunity for the State's scientists to compete for badly needed Federal dollars to support lake research. 
The University of Vermont and other Vermont colleges are ideally situated to attain Sea Grant college status to work on Lake Champlain research. These researchers have been participating in lake research projects over the past several years, pulling together limited funding from numerous sources. Designation as a Sea Grant college will remedy this situation. Vermont will be able to improve the long-term water quality and biological monitoring on Lake Champlain. This monitoring is critical to determine the success of management actions outlined in the Lake Champlain Basin Plan. The Sea Grant Program would enable Vermont to track toxic substances in the water, sediment, air and biota and invasive species. 
I want to thank my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and her staff for their assistance in increasing attention to the environmental issues in Lake Champlain.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate will soon recess until the beginning of this Congress' second Session in January of 1998. That provides time to develop a thoughtful proposal on one of the most pressing environmental threats confronting the United States as a whole, and especially the Midwest and the Northeast: namely, the rivers of pollution that stream from the smokestacks of hundreds of old coal-fired powerplants, especially in the Midwest. 
These powerplants are collectively the source of enormous amounts of air pollution. Mercury poisons lakes and streams, as well as the fish that swim in them. Oxides of nitrogen not only create groundlevel ozone that chokes almost every major America city, but are transformed into acids that contribute to both acid rain and fine particulate matter. Together with the fine particles formed by sulfur dioxide emissions, they contribute to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. Finally, carbon-rich coal adds to global warming, which has increased the temperatures of Earth's air, oceans, and soils, while raising sea levels and triggering meltdowns of glaciers and icecaps. If you want to see the effects of this pollution, you need only to hike to the top of Camel's Hump in the Green Mountains, or talk to the fishermen in Missisquoi Bay who catch fish contaminated with mercury, or measure the increasing acid deposition in pristine lakes within Vermont wilderness areas. 
Mr. President, none of this is necessary and eliminating these problems need not trigger the sort of regional conflicts that characterized the sometimes bitter ten year struggle to enact a federal program to control acid rain. There are ways of burning coal so that it produces only a tiny fraction of the air pollution now being emitted by these powerplants. And, since virtually all of these powerplants are reaching the age at which significant investment is required to keep them on line, the nation has a unique and valuable opportunity to address the problem. 
Steps should be taken not only to prevent further degradation of our environment, but also to ensure fairness in retail electricity competition. When Congress passed the Clean Air Act in  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- N O T I C E   Under the Rules for Publication of the Congressional Record, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the first session of the 105th Congress will be published on the 31st day after adjournment in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.   All materials for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices responsible for the Record in the House or Senate between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday (until the 10th day after adjournment). House Members should deliver statements to the Office of Floor Reporters (Room HT-60 of the Capitol) and Senate Members to the Office of Official Reporters of Debate (S-123 in the Capitol).   The final issue will be dated the 31st day after adjournment and will be delivered on the 33d day after adjournment. None of the material printed in the final issue of the Congressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any event, that occurred after the adjournment date.   Along with signed statements, House Members are requested, whenever possible, to submit revised statements or extensions of remarks and other materials related to House Floor debate on diskette in electronic form in ASCII, WordPerfect or MicroSoft Word format. Disks must be labeled with Members' names and the filename on the disk. All disks will be returned to Member offices via inside mail.   Senators statements should also be submitted electronically, either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to the Official Reporters of Debate at `Record@Reporters'.   Members of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material submitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by contacting the Congressional Printing Management Division, at the Government Printing Office, on 512-0224.

JOHN WARNER, Chairman.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
1970, many of the old, dirty powerplants that were expected to close down were granted exemptions to the strict air pollution control requirements that applied to new facilities. Yet, twenty years later, these old plants continue to operate and enjoy a substantial, unfair competitive economic advantage over electric generators with pollution control technology. 
If ways can be found to assure that investments are made in clean technologies, pollution of almost every sort can be sharply reduced and, in likelihood, so can electricity rates. Contrary to the recent wave of doomsday advertising paid for by multi-million dollar electric utility companies, this can be done without jeopardizing our economy. Vermont has shown how jobs can be created through renewable energy and energy efficient technology. 
It is clear, Mr. President, that these new technologies and the expertise in building and operating them, will be needed by every nation in the world. If the United States can be the first to master these new engines of the future, we can also be the first to build and export them. 
The challenge, Mr. President, is to find the proper combination of measures. During the coming winter, I hope and intend to work with my colleagues and others to identify those measures.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate today has accepted the House amendment to S. 476 to ensure Indian reservations and rural areas are eligible for the funding authorized under this bill to expand Boys & Girls Clubs across the country. I am also pleased that this legislation will be sent to the President this evening for his signature. 
When this bill was under discussion in the Senate last spring, I made sure that rural areas, including many areas of my home State of Vermont, would be eligible for grants to establish some of the targeted 2,500 new Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Representative Buyer's amendment will now ensure that Indian reservations will qualify under this bill. The original language in this bill was more restrictive, requiring the grants to be used only for the purpose of establishing Boys & Girls Clubs in public housing projects and other distressed areas. I have worked with the Boys & Girls and know that they understand that rural areas as well as urban can qualify as `distressed areas'. 
The bill is now more expansive and will give girls and boys in rural areas and on reservations greater opportunities to share in Boys & Girls Clubs and their programs. The revised statute will authorize grants for establishing and extending facilities `where needed'. Particular emphasis continues to be given to housing projects, where Boys & Girls Clubs have proven effective in preventing youth crime, and to distressed areas, rural or urban. But the `where needed' language should help make expansion into rural areas a greater priority. 
The changes made to that program by this bill also permit up to 5 percent of the grant funds to be used to establish a role model speakers' program. Anyone who has seen Boys & Girls Clubs of America commercial with Denzel Washington and his coach will know the kinds of outstanding role models that we are seeking to promote to encourage and motivate young people to be involved, productive citizens. 
I have seen the outstanding results at the Boys & Girls Clubs in Burlington, VT. The role models they provide include the outstanding instructors and volunteers who work in the Club's many programs. I have also witnessed the outstanding result of the Kids `N Kops Program at the University of Vermont with the cooperation of local law enforcement. 
Expansions are proceeding and over 200 new clubs serving 180,000 youth were opened as a result of last year's appropriation. I know that the Burlington Boys & Girls Clubs received $100,000 to help enhance that Club's outreach efforts. I am also pleased to report that a new club will soon be established in Rutland, VT. I would like to thank Robbie Callaway and the many others at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America who have worked so hard to establish these important programs throughout the United States. I applaud your dedication and commitment to ensuring that our Nation's youth have solid alternatives to hanging out in the streets. 
I know that the national headquarters is also researching the feasibility of a club in Essex Junction. I hope that with the continuation of this initiative they will look for opportunities to serve young people in Montpelier, Brattleboro, St. Johnsbury and other Vermont locations, as well. I would be delighted for a sizable portion of the 1,000,000 additional young people who we hope will be served by the end of this century to come from the 145,000 young people in Vermont and those in other rural areas. 
In supporting this bill, I encourage the Boys & Girls Clubs as one example of a successful youth-oriented program that can help make a difference in young people's lives and prevent crime and delinquency. I also support the work of others who are effective with young people, including our outstanding 4-H programs. 
This measure should not become an excuse for anyone not to join with us to bolster comprehensive drug education and prevention for all elementary and high school students. As I have urged in the Judiciary Committee discussions of S. 10, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act, we should proceed to help create after school `safe havens' where children are protected from drugs, gangs and crime with activities including drug prevention education, academic tutoring, mentoring, and abstinence training. This bill is a step but should not be the end of our efforts to support programs that help prevent juvenile delinquency, crime, and drug abuse.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America's founders recognized and valued the creativity of this Nation's citizens such that intellectual property rights are rooted in the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 8 of the Constitution states that `The Congress shall have power * * * [t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.' The Continental Congress proclaimed, `Nothing is more properly a man's own than the fruit of his study.' 
Protecting intellectual property rights is just as important today as it was when America was a fledgling nation. 
It is for this reason I am pleased that the Senate is considering H.R. 2265, the `No Electronic Theft [NET] Act of 1997.' I introduced the first legislation on this subject in 1995. The bill was the `Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995,' and it stood as the only legislation on this issue in the 104th Congress. I then made some changes to that bill and introduced it this session as the `Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997,' S. 1044. Senator Kyl is an original cosponsor of S. 1044 and I thank him for his support. 
Like the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997, the NET Act of 1997 would close a significant loophole in our copyright law and enhance the Government's ability to bring criminal charges in certain cases of willful copyright infringement. By insuring better protection of the creative works available online, this bill will also encourage the continued growth of the Internet and our National Information Infrastructure. It will encourage the ingenuity of the American people, and will send a powerful message to intellectual property pirates and thieves that we will not tolerate theft. 
For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law, a defendant's willful copyright infringement must be `for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.' Not-for-profit or noncommercial copyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no matter how egregious the infringement or how great the loss to the copyright holder. This presents an enormous loophole in criminal liability for willful infringers who can use digital technology to make exact copies of copyrighted software and other digitally encoded works, and then use computer networks for quick, inexpensive and mass distribution of pirated, infringing works. The NET Act would close this legal loophole. 
United States versus LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is an example of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In that case, the defendant had set up computer bulletin board systems on the Internet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software programs. This resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over $1 million over a 6-week period. Since the defendant apparently did not profit from the software piracy, the Government could not prosecute him under criminal copyright law and instead charged him with wire fraud. The District Court described the student's conduct `at best * * * as irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values.' 
Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because it viewed copyright law as the exclusive authority for prosecuting criminal copyright infringement. The Court expressly invited Congress to revisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, stating: 
Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer. One can envision ways that the copyright law could be modified to permit such prosecution. But, `[i]t is the legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.' 
I introduced the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995 on August 4, 1995 in response to this problem. The NET Act is the result of our efforts. It would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful copyright infringements in the following ways: First, it amends the term `financial gain' as used in the Copyright Act to include `receipt, or expectation of receipt, or anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.' This revision would make clear that `financial gain' includes bartering for, and the trading of, pirated software. 
Second, it amends Section 506(a) of the Copyright Act to provide that any person who infringes a copyright willfully by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of one or more copies or phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works with a total retail value of more than $1,000, shall be subject to criminal liability. 
A misdemeanor offense under the bill is defined as an offense in which an individual reproduces or distributes one or more copies or phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works with a total value of more than $1,000. 
The felony threshold under the bill is defined as an offense in which an individual reproduces or distributes 10 or more copies of phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works with a total retail value of $2,500 or more. 
Section (2)(b) of the bill clarifies that for purposes of subsection 506(a) of the Copyright Act only, `willful infringement' requires more than just evidence of making an unauthorized copy of a work. This clarification was included to address the concerns expressed by libraries and Internet access to services because the standard of `willfulness' for criminal copyright infringement is not statutorily defined and the court's interpretation have varied somewhat among the Federal circuits. 
This clarification does not change the current interpretation of the word `willful' as developed by case law and as applied by the Department of Justice, nor does it change the definition of `willful' as it is used elsewhere in the Copyright Act. 
Third, the bill requires that any criminal proceeding brought under the Copyright Act must commence within 5 years from the time the cause of action arose. The current limit, as contained in section 507(a) of the Copyright Act, is 3 years. This brings copyright crimes into conformance with the statute of limitations for other criminal acts under title 18 of the United States Code. 
Fourth, the bill would insert new subsections in title 18 of the United States Code requiring that victims of offenses concerning unauthorized fixation and trafficking of live musical performances and victims of offenses concerning trafficking in counterfeit goods or services be given the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement to the probation officer preparing the presentence report. The bill directs that the statement identify the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss suffered, including the estimated economic impact of the offense on that victim. 
The NET Act reflects the recommendations and hard work of the Department of Justice and the Copyright Office. Specifically, Scott Charney and David Green of the Department of Justice and Marybeth Peters, Shira Perlmutter, and Jule Sigall of the Copyright Office helped me on this legislation. The Department of Justice and the Copyright Office provided valuable input as far back as 3 years ago, when I introduced the first legislation on this subject, and they have worked with me through the drafting of this year's Senate bill and with me and all the interested parties on this year's House version to ensure that the final product was one that could be widely accepted. In fact, just today the Senate received a letter from the Department of Justice providing its views on the NET Act and strongly supporting the enactment of this legislation. 
I also want to thank Mr. Hyde, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Coble, Mr. Frank, and Mr. Goodlatte for their fine work on this matter. 
By passing this legislation, we send a strong message that we value intellectual property, as abstract and arcane as it may be, in the same way that we value the real and personal property of our citizens. Just as we will not tolerate the theft of software, CD's, books, or movie cassettes from a store, so will we not permit the stealing of intellectual property over the Internet.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we wrap up our business for the first year of the 105th Congress, I believe it is appropriate to take account of the Senate's advice and consent on judicial nominations. As I have said many times this year in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor, the Senate has failed to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities to the Federal judiciary. 
In recent days, the Senate has quickened its painfully slow pace on reviewing and confirming judicial nominations. I have commended the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for holding two judicial nominations hearings in September and October and for holding another hearing yesterday, which brings the total for the year to nine. 
Unfortunately, we had no hearings at all in 4 months--January, February, April or August--and none is anticipated in December. I repeat that we have never had a day go by this session without having a backlog of at least 20 judicial nominations awaiting a hearing. Even with the virtual frenzy of last-minute hearings, we will close the year with more than 30 nominees having never been accorded a confirmation hearing. 
I acknowledge that the majority leader has allowed the Senate to proceed to confirm 13 judicial nominees in the last week, but that still leaves eight outstanding nominees on the Senate Calendar still to be considered. 
I understand that Senator Boxer has received a commitment from the Republican leadership to proceed to consideration of the longstanding nomination of Margaret Morrow by the middle of February next year. I commend the Senator from California for achieving what appeared to be impossible, getting the Senate to debate this outstanding nominee. I deeply regret that we have not proceeded to debate and vote to confirm Margaret Morrow to the District Court for the Central District of California this year. Hers is the nomination that has been stalled before the Senate the longest, since June 12. 
She has twice been reported to the Senate favorably by the Judiciary Committee. She has been unfairly maligned and her family and law partners made to suffer for far too long without cause or justification. Some have chosen to use her nomination as a vehicle for partisan political, narrow ideological, and conservative fund raising purposes. She deserved better treatment. The people of California deserved to have this nominee confirmed and in place hearing cases long ago. The wait can never be rectified or justified. 
I hope that the Republican leadership will not require any of the other nominees currently pending on the calendar to remain hostage to their inaction. Ann Aiken was finally reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee earlier this month. Her nomination was first received in November 1995, 2 years ago. She had an earlier hearing in September 1996 and another last month. This is a judicial emergency vacancy that should be filled without further delay. 
G. Patrick Murphy would be a much-needed addition to the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. He was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee and his confirmation should be expedited. 
Michael P. McCuskey was likewise reported without a single objection by the Judiciary Committee for a vacancy that is a judicial emergency that ought to be filled without delay. 
Frederica Massiah-Jackson is a Pennsylvania State court judge. The Senate should move to consider her nomination without the months of delay that will ensue following adjournment. 
As we enter the final hours of this session, the Senate has confirmed 36 of the President's 77 judicial nominations. That is certainly better than the 17 confirmed last year. It is better than the total of only 9 who had been confirmed before September this year. But in a time period in which we have experienced 121 vacancies on the Federal courts, the Senate has proceeded to confirm judges at an annual rate of only three per month. And that does not begin to consider the natural attrition that will lead to more vacancies over the next several months. 
I want to thank the President of the United States for helping. Not only has the President sent us almost 80 nominees this year but he devoted a national radio address to reminding the Senate of its constitutional responsibility to consider and confirm qualified nominees to the Federal bench. When he spoke, the American people, and maybe even the Senate, listened. Since word that he would be speaking out on this issue reached Capitol Hill, the pace has picked up a bit. 
Unfortunately, the final report on this session of Congress is that the Senate did not make progress on the judicial vacancy crisis. In fact, there are many more vacancies in the Federal judiciary today than when the Senate adjourned last year. At the snail's pace that the Senate has proceeded with judicial nominations this year, we are not even keeping up with attrition. When Congress adjourned last year, there were 64 vacancies on the Federal bench. In the last 11 months, another 57 vacancies have occurred. Thus, after the confirmation of 36 judges in 11 months, there has been a net increase of 16 vacancies, an increase of more than one-third in the number of current Federal judicial vacancies. 
Judicial vacancies have been increasing, not decreasing, over the course of this year and therein lies the vacancy crisis, which the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the Federal judiciary.' 
The Senate still has pending before it 11 nominees who were first nominated during the last Congress, including five who have been pending since 1995. While I am delighted that we are moving more promptly with respect to some of this year's nominees, I remain concerned about the other vacancies and other nominees. 
There remains no excuse for the Senate's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, M. Margaret McKeown, Susan Oki Mollway, Margaret M. Morrow, Clarence J. Sundram, Ann L. Aiken, Annabelle Rodriguez, Michael D. Schattman and Hilda G. Tagle, all of whom have been pending since the last Congress. All of these nominees have been waiting at least 18 months and some more than 2 years for Senate action. 
Most of these outstanding nominees have been waiting all year for a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably reported last year. Judge Paez had a hearing last year but has been passed over so far this year. Judge Paez, Professor Fletcher, and Ms. McKeown are all nominees for judicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, as well. 
Next year, I hope that the Committee will proceed without delay to consider these nominations, as well as the nominations of Clarence Sundram and Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who have participated in hearings but are still bottled up in the Judiciary Committee. 
We should be moving promptly to fill the vacancies plaguing the Federal courts. Thirty-five confirmations in a year in which we have witnessed 121 vacancies is not fulfilling the Senate's constitutional responsibility. 
At the end of Senator Hatch's first year chairing the Committee, 1995, the Senate adjourned having confirmed 58 judicial nominations. In the last year of the Bush Presidency, a Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to confirm 66 judges. 
Unfortunately, this year there has been a concerted campaign of intimidation that threatens the very independence and integrity of our judiciary. We are witnessing an ideological and political attack on the judiciary by some, both outside and within Congress. Earlier this fall the Republican Majority Whip in the House and the Majority Leader in the Senate talked openly about seeking to `intimidate' the Federal judiciary. It is one thing to criticize the reasoning of an opinion, the result in a case, or to introduce legislation to change the law. It is quite another matter to undercut the separation of powers and the independence that the Founders created to insulate the judiciary from politics. Independent judicial review has been an important check on the political branches of our Federal Government that have served us so well for over 200 years. 
I want to commend all those who have spoken out against this extremist and destructive rhetoric. 
I also thank my Democratic colleagues for their patience this year. No Democrat has delayed or placed a `hold' on a single judicial nominee for a single day, all year. It is the normal course in the Senate when one Senator sees the recommendations of other Senators of the other party moving through to confirmation while his or her nominees are being held back, to place such a hold. This year we resisted. 
I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the President's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to have the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfil its constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are growing more critical by the day. 
I hope that when we return in January, there will be a realization by those in this body who have started down this destructive path of attacking the judiciary and stalling the confirmation of qualified nominees to the Federal bench that those efforts do not serve the national interest or the American people. I hope that we can once again remove these important matters from partisan and ideological politics.

Mr. LEAHY. 
Mr. President, as the ranking member of the nutrition subcommittee, I want to make very clear that I am looking forward to working with the chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator Lugar, with the ranking member, Senator Harkin, and with the chairman of the nutrition subcommittee, Senator McConnell, on the child nutrition reauthorization bill next year. 
When I was chairman of that committee, and continuing under the helm of Senator Lugar, the Agriculture Committee worked together in a bipartisan fashion on nutrition legislation. 
I am proud of all the members of that committee who over the years worked together on improving nutrition programs for children. I also had the privilege of working with the former majority leader--Senator Bob Dole--on many child nutrition matters. 
The bill that I am introducing today does not represent my effort on a reauthorization bill--I will work on that bill with members of the committee, including the three leadership Members mentioned above. 
Rather, this bill indicates changes that should be enacted into law regardless of other actions the Congress might take regarding child nutrition reauthorization. 
It includes child nutrition provisions that were included, with some modifications, in the Senate-passed research bill--which passed the Senate by unanimous consent. 
Over the recess I intend to consult with nutrition leaders in Vermont, the Under Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, Shirley Watkins, Secretary Glickman, national nutrition advocates and local program directors to gather information for the reauthorization effort. 
Also, I urge the President to include sufficient funding in his budget proposals to fund this bill as well as other nutrition initiatives which the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Food and Consumer Services are working to develop. 
I must compliment Under Secretary Shirley Watkins for the great job she has done so far. She has taken strong command of an agency that was adrift. Also, I continue to appreciate Secretary Dan Glickman's leadership role in the administration regarding nutrition programs and the strong support of his chief of staff, Greg Frazier. 
I note also that Senator Tim Johnson has introduced a school lunch program bill. I will carefully study that bill over the recess. I will also look at the study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning called Energizing the Classroom. 
Over the years many Vermonters have provided me with outstanding advice and guidance on child nutrition issues. 
I intend to work with Jo Busha who heads the Child Nutrition Programs for the Vermont Department of Education. She has done a remarkable job in promoting school-based nutrition programs and was recently commended by the Food Research and Action Center for her accomplishments. I was very pleased to work with the committee on a bill that set up the school breakfast startup grant program which has worked extremely well in Vermont. It provided thousands of dollars to Vermont schools to cover the one-time costs of setting up a breakfast program. 
I look forward to receiving advice from Mary Carlson, president of the National Association of Farmers' Markets Nutrition Programs, on the WIC-Farmer's Market Program known as the Farm-to-Family program in Vermont. 
This program has helped in greatly expanding the number of farmers 
markets in Vermont and helped low-income families provide their children with healthy foods. 
My bill would assure funding for this program and permit other States to participate in the program, or to increase their participation levels. 
The bill provides assured funding for programs like the Vermont Common Roots program of Food Works, a nonprofit educational organization in Vermont which has been praised by educators and administrators as an effective educational tool. 
Robert Dostis has done an outstanding job as the executive director of the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger. He also deserves a great deal of credit regarding the effort to get more schools on the school breakfast program. He has recently written a `Report on Childhood Hunger in Vermont: A Handbook for Action.' 
He cites some startling statistics in this report. For example, he notes that about 8,000 Vermont children are receiving food from local Vermont food shelves--which is double the figure for 1990. 
In addition, nearly 222,000 meals are being served yearly at two dozen community kitchens in Vermont--that is 21 percent more than in 1994. 
I will be also working with Donna Bister, as I have for years, on issues related to the WIC program and with Alison Gardner who is the Public Health Nutrition Chief, for the Vermont Department of Health. 
I want to extend a special thanks to Dr. Richard Narkewicz of Vermont who is a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He recently visited me with his grandson Corey. 
Most of all I want to thank the hundreds of volunteers who run Vermont's Food Shelves and Community Kitchens, and all of those helping out at Vermont's Community Action Agencies. 
For many years I have watched the tremendous contributions made by the Vermont FoodBank in the fight against hunger. They have been a first line of defense against child hunger in Vermont and I look forward to working with their director, Deborah Flateman. 
All of these Vermonters, and hundreds more who I have not mentioned, carry out the true Vermont tradition of extending a helping hand to neighbors in need. 
My bill incorporates many ideas from Vermonters. I have often designed nutrition legislation based on ideas from State and local officials from around the Nation. 
Since this bill is not a full reauthorization bill--which I will cosponsor at a later date with other members of the Committee--I have not automatically extended each expiration date in current law. I will certainly support such extensions as appropriate at a later date and will support many other improvements to the bill. 
Section 101 is based on an idea provided to me by Joseph Keifer of the Vermont Food Works program. It provides modest Federal funding to help integrate food and nutrition projects with elementary school curricula for a few pilot tests of this provision. 
Section 102 increases the reimbursement rates for the summer food service program to a level that should encourage strong participation. At the recommendation of the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger the bill also provides special funding to help defray the costs of transporting children to the food service locations. This additional financial support--of 75 cents per day for each child transported to and from school--is only applicable in very rural areas, as defined by USDA. 
Vermont child care sponsors strongly recommended that I support funding for an additional meal supplement for children who are in a 
child care center for 8 hours or more. Section 103 of the bill does just that and thus helps working parents. 
The bill provides for the eligibility of additional schools for the after school care meals program and expands funding for a program that provides meals to homeless preschool children in emergency shelters. 
Title II of the bill creates a grant program to assist schools and others to establish or expand a school breakfast program, or a summer food service program. $5 million, per year, in mandatory funding would be made available for this effort. 
The school breakfast start up program in Vermont, before it was terminated by Congress, was a remarkable success in part due to the hard work of Jo Busha, Bob Dostis, the Vermont School Food Service Association, and many others. 
Also under Title II of the bill, the WIC Farmers' Market Program is provided guaranteed funding. I have worked on this program for a number of years with Mary Carlson of Vermont. Mary is now the president of the association that represents State farmers' market nutrition programs such as the WIC Farmers' Market Program. Making this tremendous program mandatory will assure funding and avoid any appearance of being in competition with the WIC program for appropriated funds. 
The bill also sets forth a sense of the Congress that the WIC program should be fully funded, now and forever, for all eligible applicants nationwide. I know that reaching this goal has taken a long time. I appreciate all the help that Donna Bister, the Vermont WIC Director, and many other Vermonters, as well as Bread for the World at the national level, have provided on the WIC program. David Beckmann and Barbara Howell of Bread for the World have worked for years toward this goal. 
Finally, I have heard from Alison Gardner about the problems she is having with funding for the Nutrition, Education and Training Program. Congress made that program mandatory but then changed its status back to a program subject to appropriations. My bill will provide $10 million a year for that program and provide a State minimum grant of $85,000 per year. 
I want to emphasize again that my bill represents some important child nutrition initiatives. I hope they will all be included in the reauthorization bill. I look forward to working with Senators Lugar, Harkin, McConnell and all the other members of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee on this effort just as we worked together on the child nutrition provisions in the Senate-passed research bill. 
I also look forward to working with all the Members of the House of Representatives Education and the Workforce Committee. I know they have a keen interest in protecting children and I have enjoyed working in the past with Chairman Goodling and with the ranking minority member Mr. Bill Clay. 
The last reauthorization bill passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives by unanimous consent. This shows how well the Congress can work together when the interests of children are at stake.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate unanimously confirmed Rodney W. Sippel to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Missouri. 
Rodney Sippel is a uniquely well-qualified nominee, with a wealth of experience in the practice of law and in public service. He has years of litigation experience at the law firm of Husch & Eppenberger in St. Louis, MO. He is also a dedicated public servant, having served in the office of our former colleague, Senator Thomas Eagleton, and as an administrative assistant to the House Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt. 
The American Bar Association found Mr. Sippel to be qualified for this appointment and his nomination enjoys the support of both Senators from Missouri. 
The President nominated Rodney Sippel on May 15, 1997. After several months of inaction, the Judiciary Committee finally held a hearing on his nomination on October 28 and the committee favorably and unanimously reported his nomination to the full Senate on November 6. 
I congratulate Rodney Sippel and his family on his confirmation. I look forward to his service as a U.S. district court judge. 
I would like to note that the nomination process experienced by Rodney Sippel is a common one in this 105th Congress. It is an experience of unnecessary delay. After his nomination languished for months in the Judiciary Committee, the majority finally focused on Rodney Sippel and he was unanimously confirmed. I am not sure why it took so long for the majority to confirm this well-qualified nominee, but I am glad that they finally realized that he will be an outstanding Federal judge.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know that tucked in the hundreds of pages of provisions on appropriating federal funds on existing programs in this conference report is legislative language to create a new $250 million grant program, called the `Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant.' This newly authorized program is based on the block grant program in H.R. 3, the `Juvenile Crime Control Act of 1997,' although that bill have not passed or even been considered by the Senate. 
This new program sounds great until you look at the proverbial fine print. Because of all the new requirements on the States this is just a tease--many States won't qualify for a penny of this money under H.R. 3 as passed by the House of Representatives on May 8, 1997. 
For instance, H.R. 3 mandates that a state must set up a new system of record keeping relating to juveniles that is equivalent to the record keeping system for adults for similar conduct under state and Federal law to be eligible for this block grant. Many states would be forced to make considerable changes to their laws to comply with this mandate. And the cost of complying with this mandate, which would require capturing records for minor juvenile offenses too, is totally unknown. 
My home state of Vermont, for example, would not qualify for the block grant in H.R. 3, even though my State has some of the toughest juvenile crime laws in the country, and has the lowest juvenile violent crime rates in the country. Massachusetts will not qualify either, even though that State has made enormous progress in reducing its violent crime problem. Our two States must be doing something right. 
I ask why we are being forced to take up the ill-considered H.R. 3 block grant on an appropriations bill. The answer is because the Republican leadership says so. Otherwise, they might miss out on claiming credit in connection with fighting juvenile crime before Congress adjourns. I guess in their minds nothing happens that does not involve their political agenda. Fighting juvenile crime should not be about politics. Unfortunately, this heavy-handed effort is purely partisan. For a group that preaches states' rights, the Republican Leadership has no trouble trampling the hard work and insight of 50 state legislatures who have enacted juvenile crime legislation. H.R. 3 is a presumptuous attempt to have the heavy hand of the federal government dictate state criminal justice policy. This is the wrong way to craft serious legislation. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee spent eight mark-ups over two months earlier this year in crafting its juvenile crime bill, the `Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1997,' S. 10. Why did Chairman Hatch and the other members of the Judiciary Committee work so hard to try to craft a bill if the Republican leadership is just going to slip parts of the House bill into a spending bill at the last minute before Congress adjourns for the year? Every Member of the Judiciary Committee worked many hours to revise S. 10 before it was reported by the Committee to the full Senate. This bill still has major problems, but is much improved because of that deliberative legislative process and much better than its House companion, H.R. 3. I am hopeful that S. 10 can be further improved on the Senate floor. 
This juvenile block grant approach is flawed and would benefit from attention through the normal legislative process of hearing, public comment, review, Committee consideration, amendment and report, Senate action and House-Senate conference. Instead, the Republican leadership is trying to force this flawed block grant through the Senate. 
Fortunately, we in the Senate have been able to modify the flawed block grant program in H.R. 3 to make it tolerable before it was included in this appropriations bill. I want to thank the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary, Senator Hollings, and the Subcommittee's Chairman, Senator Gregg, for working with me, Senator Biden, and other Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Our modifications make it clear that every state is eligible for the juvenile crime block grant program in this conference report. To qualify for the block grant program in this conference report, the Governor of a State may certify to the Attorney General that the State will consider legislation, policies and practices which if enacted would qualify the State for a grant under H.R. 3. Governor Dean of my home State has indicated to me that he is willing to make such a certification for Vermont to be eligible for this block grant. We have also limited this program to the 1998 Fiscal Year and made it subject to future authorization legislation. 
Mr. President, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of Congress to enact carefully considered legislation to reduce and prevent juvenile crime. But this hastily conceived block grant approach as part of this appropriations bill is the wrong way to achieve those goals.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I see other Senators waiting to take the floor. I will note a couple of things. The distinguished majority leader has mentioned that it is Sunday. The guest Chaplain today, Father Paul Lavin of St. Joseph's Church, is my pastor when I am away from my home in Vermont, which is not often on a Sunday. 
But this Sunday is extraordinary, that is, being in Washington and not in Vermont. 
Father Lavin also prayed for, in the mass this morning which my wife and I attended, the Congress and the Government, and so forth, as we all do. 
Sometimes we have to be careful we don't get too much of what we pray for, but I think it would probably be safe to say, as I look around at the staff and everybody else here, that they were probably praying that it would come to a conclusion. 
In that respect, I note, Mr. President, as I have in other years, that while I may joke about Senators being nothing but constitutional impediments to the staff, the fact is, the U.S. Senate, the greatest parliamentary body in the world, could not exist without the extraordinarily talented men and women who work on Capitol Hill for Members on both sides of the aisle, for committees, for the Senate itself, and those who take the notes of our proceedings, to those who keep the procedures of the Senate moving. 
I say a special compliment to the young men and women who come here and serve as pages, come from all over the country and serve here as pages. I have been fortunate to have had a series of some of the most exemplary young men and women from Vermont who have served here as pages. They go through a rigorous screening process. Only the best get picked. And they go back to be the best among our citizens in our own State. 
The people in this country ofttimes do not realize the extraordinary dedication of the men and women who work here who sometimes put in literally around-the-clock hours and days, who literally give of themselves more than any private industry could ever expect of anyone. And that is what makes the Senate work. 
My friend from Mississippi and I were discussing earlier putting together this last-minute legislation. Well, we can make some policy decisions, but it is these people who have to then pull it together. For Foreign operations, Tim Rieser, from my staff, carries out my duties as ranking member on that. There are dozens of others on both sides that have to do this--Robin Cleveland for Senator McConnell, who is the chairman of that subcommittee. 
And it is the same with all the subcommittees, trying to pull these pieces together and actually have the paper. We stand up and say `aye' or `nay,' but they have to have the papers on the floor in perfect condition for us to vote on them. 
Then, whether it is the people in the Cloakroom, the people back at our offices, or anybody else, they also give up their family time to be here for the good of the country.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope we can complete these foreign aid bills. I would also say to my friend from Mississippi, he mentioned whether we should use taxpayers' money for abortion in the foreign aid bill. There is a specific prohibition against any U.S. dollars being used for abortions abroad in the foreign aid bill. 
In fact, as Senator Mark Hatfield, former chairman of the Appropriation Committee, and I pointed out on the floor earlier--he was very much a right-to-life, antiabortion Senator, consistent in that--pointed out that the family planning moneys that have gone in the foreign aid bill have dramatically decreased the number of abortions in those areas where they were used. 
An example was Russia where abortion was used as a form of birth control, where we gave them family planning money and the number of abortions dropped dramatically. 
So I hope that we will continue to do that and realize, while family planning is something available to most people in the United States, in a lot of other countries it is not available because of costs, because of techniques, because of training, for whatever reason. Unfortunately, in those countries ofttimes abortions are a means of family planning. So I hope that those who are against abortion would realize family planning money can help us prevent that.

Mr. LEAHY. Then lastly, Mr. President--I will probably speak on this again this afternoon. If we go out, it means there will not be a chance to confirm a number of judges who are pending, who have been pending for a considerable period of time; one in particular, who has been voted out of our committee twice, once last year and again this year, Margaret Morrow, one of the most qualified people, man or woman, ever to be nominated to be a district court judge. 
We also have what I think is the shocking situation of Bill Lann Lee, who has been subjected to some of the most scurrilous charges--charges, unfortunately, repeated even by Members of the Senate. The charges have been refuted, but need to be refuted in a hearing. We have asked for a further hearing on Bill Lann Lee just so those charges can be refuted. We have been told that we cannot have that hearing. 
I renew the request. We should have it. 
We talk about civil rights in this country. The civil rights of this country are determined by having strong laws and strong people to enforce those laws. I do not believe in the better natures of our souls as Americans that all of us would support the civil rights of all others simply in a vacuum. Many of us would; others do need the requirement of a law to do that. 
I would like to think that I am a person who would never break into an unlocked, unguarded warehouse in the middle of the night to steal things. But we have laws and locks to prevent others who may not feel as strongly motivated to obey the commandment: `Thou shalt not steal.' 
By the same token, we set up laws that say: `You shall not discriminate. You shall protect the civil rights of all Americans.' Those laws need to be enforced. We do not have a chief enforcer now. The President has nominated Bill Lann Lee, a most qualified person for that position. 
Unfortunately, the debate on this fine nominee took a decidedly partisan turn when the Speaker of the House chose to intervene in this matter and urge the Senate Republican leader to kill this nomination. He waited until after the confirmation hearing to raise and mischaracterize a case about which no member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican or Democrat, had asked a single question. Indeed, apparently unaware of the decision of his party leaders to defeat this nominee, Chairman Hatch predicted on the weekend news programs following the hearing that the nomination would be reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee but might face tough going on the Senate floor. 
In his unfortunate letter, Speaker Gingrich unfairly criticized Mr. Lee and accused him of unethical conduct. Since that letter Speaker Gingrich's charges have been repeated over and over again. Indeed, Senator Hatch devoted an entire section of his statement last Tuesday opposing Mr. Lee to the Tipton-Whittingham case. Because of the mischaracterizations of this case and the misstatements of Mr. Lee's record and because Republican opponents are now distorting and contorting Mr. Lee's views, testimony and work, I thought it appropriate to request an opportunity for Bill Lee to respond to the false charges and impression being espoused by his opposition. I thought it only fair. 
On behalf of and along with the other minority members of the Judiciary Committee, I sent Senator Hatch a letter yesterday formally requesting such a hearing. The chairman refused our request for a hearing. That is unfortunate. He explained on a Sunday talk show morning that all the questions that would be raised at an additional hearing had already been covered and implied that questions about the Tipton-Whittingham case had been asked in the extensive written questions to Mr. Lee that followed the hearing. 
In fact, no Senator asked a single question about the Tipton-Whittingham case at the October 22 hearing and, although, 
Mr. Lee was sent page after page of written questions following the hearing, only Senator Hatch asked about the case. Unfortunately, Senator Hatch's question and its answer have been ignored by those opposing Mr. Lee. Speaker Gingrich and others are making false charges and the nominee has been given no fair opportunity to set the record straight. 
Let me explain what the Tipton-Whittingham case is about. I regret having to discuss this matter at all since it remains a pending matter in the District Court for the Central District of California. The case includes serious allegations of sexual harassment and gender and racial discrimination involving the Los Angeles Police Department arising in part from an association of officers, called `Men Against Women,' which was apparently organized by former Los Angeles Police detective Mark Fuhrman.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recall when times were different. I recall when charges were raised against Clarence Thomas and the Judiciary Committee held several days of additional hearings after that nomination had already been reported by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. There was a tie vote in committee on the Thomas nomination, which would not have even been reported to the Senate had we not also voted virtually unanimously, with six Democrats joining seven Republicans, to report the Thomas nomination to the floor without recommendation. Of course, ultimately the nomination of Judge Thomas to become Justice Thomas was confirmed by the Senate. 
Over the last decade and one-half Republicans have pioneered and developed procedures whereby the Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate for its consideration nominations on which the committee had come to a tie vote and even, in the case of Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, an overwhelmingly negative vote. 
I recall for example the nomination of Daniel Manion which was reported to the Senate after a tie vote and was ultimately approved by the Senate. I recall, as well, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court which was reported after a tie vote and ultimately approved by the Senate. 
Time after time during the Reagan and Bush years the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee urged that the full Senate be permitted to decide these questions. Senator Thurmond argued in favor of reporting an executive branch nomination on which the committee had voted negatively, noting: 
As long as I am a member of this Committee, I will give an opportunity, whether it is majority or minority, to send the nominations to the Senate. I think the Senate is entitled to the recommendation [of the Committee], and you made the recommendation by the vote just taken. But I think the Senate is entitled to a vote on this matter, I think the President is entitled for the Senate to vote, and I think the country is entitled for the Senate to vote. I would hope it would be sent to the Senate and let the full Senate act. 
I have been one, frankly, who has not always supported such action. It took a while to bring me around. But I joined in voting to report the Thomas nomination after a tie vote. 
It remains my hope that we will find a way to show Bill Lee the same fairness that we showed Clarence Thomas and allow his nomination to be debated and voted upon by the U.S. 
Senate. It would be ironic if, after the Senate proceeded to debate and vote on the Thomas nomination--one that included charges that he engaged in sexual harassment, the Republican leadership prevented the Senate from considering a nominee because he has worked to remedy sexual harassment and gender discrimination. 
I feel confident that this nomination, the first Asian-American to head the Civil Rights Division, would be confirmed by the majority of the Senate. I believe that when the facts and record are reviewed fairly and dispassionately he will be confirmed. When the country has had an opportunity to focus on this important nomination and Senators have had a chance to consider how their constituents feel, I am confident that a positive outcome will be assured. 
From all that I have seen over the past week, it appears to me that the Republican leadership is intent upon seeking to kill this nomination and determined to kill it in this committee and never give the Senate an opportunity to consider it. I do not think that it is fair or right or right for the country. We need Bill Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times. 
No one can argue that the President has sent to us a person not qualified by experience to lead the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee's record of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor and when he said to this committee that quotas are illegal and wrong and that he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about his resolve to do what is right. The Senate should be given the opportunity to debate and vote on this outstanding nominee and then give Bill Lee the chance to serve the country and all Americans. 
I think the Senate has committed a great wrong to him in blocking his nomination, that is absolutely wrong.

Throughout his distinguished career as a civil rights lawyer, Mr. Lee has worked to advance the civil rights progress of the nation and of our richly diverse city of Los Angeles. 
In my opinion, Bill Lee is an astute lawyer who is superbly qualified to enforce our national civil rights laws. Mr. Lee's candidacy offers the President an excellent opportunity to reaffirm his strong support of women's rights and civil rights laws. 
Mr. Lee first became known to me as opposing counsel in an important civil rights case concerning poor bus riders in Los Angeles. As Mayor, I took a leading role in settling that case. The work of my opponents rarely evoke my praise, but the negotiations could not have concluded successfully without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise. 
I know that his expertise is the result of working twenty-two years in the `All Star' leagues of civil rights litigators. His track record is nationally renowned and speaks for itself. Beyond the many victories, what makes his work special is that he has represented clients from every background, including poor whites, women and children suffering from lead poisoning. His admirable ability to win the trust of so many communities is evident in the broad coalition of civil rights and women's rights experts who are backing his candidacy for this position. 
Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights law. He does not believe in quotas. He has pursued flexible and reasonable remedies that in each case were approved by a court. 
Mr. Lee is an outstanding citizen of Los Angeles. He has my enthusiastic support and strongest recommendation for the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
Sincerely, 
Richard J. Riordan, Mayor.   
Los Angeles Police Commission, Los Angeles, CA, November 5, 1997. 
Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  
Dear Senator Hatch: As Vice-President of the Los Angeles Police Commission, and a Governor Wilson appointee to the California Fair Employment & Housing Commission (the state's civil rights enforcement agency), please allow me to clarify the record and give my unqualified support for Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The clarification involves a case entitled Tipton-Whittingham, et al. v. City of Los Angeles, wherein allegations of sexual harassment and sex discrimination in the Los Angeles Police Department (`LAPD') have been asserted. This case appears to have become an issue in the nomination of Mr. Lee. 
The allegations in Tipton-Whittingham, while disputed in some respects, are serious matters that the LAPD are committed to addressing. Issues of gender bias and harassment have been raised not only by these plaintiffs but also by independent and respected voices such as the Christopher Commission. The parties engaged in arms length negotiations for more than a year before a proposed partial consent decree was submitted for approval to the Los Angeles City Council and then the Court. 
The proposed decree was presented to the federal magistrate only after being vetted by the Police Commission, the Mayor's office, the City Council and the City Attorney's office. While members of the Police Commission, including this Commissioner, and the Mayor's office initially objected to specific provisions of the proposed consent decree, those objections were fully heard and addressed before the decree was presented. 
As you know, that proposed consent decree has not been approved by the Federal Court. In the meantime, the parties are engaged in mediation before Charles G. Bakely, Jr. in the hopes of reaching a complete settlement of the lawsuit. Hopefully, any settlement will ensure that the LAPD of the future is free of racial and gender bias and sexual harassment, and any consent decree will neither on its face nor in operation require or induce unlawful preferences. I hasten to add, however, that the proposed partial consent decree previously submitted to the Federal Court had that same objective. 
As a final matter, in my role as Assistant General Counsel for Hughes Electronics responsible for labor and employment law matters, I have opposed Mr. Lee in employment litigation. I was then and continue to be impressed by his balance, ethics, intelligence and commitment to reaching practical solutions. In my view, he would be an outstanding addition to the Department of Justice. 
Should you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to call me. 
Sincerely, 
T. Warren Jackson, Vice-President.   
Office of the City Attorney, Los Angeles, CA, October 29, 1997. 
Hon. Trent Lott, Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC. Re: Bill Lann Lee Confirmation. 
Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As an Assistant City Attorney for the City of Los Angeles--and opposing counsel to Bill Lann Lee in recent federal civil rights litigation--I read with concern the October 27 letter to you from the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I believe the Speaker has been misinformed about many of the facts set out in that letter, and therefore the conclusions he reaches about Mr. Lee's fitness for public office, and in particular for the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, are unwarranted. 
The Speaker's letter begins by asserting that Mr. Lee `attempted to force through a consent decree mandating racial and gender preferences in the Los Angeles Police Department.' This assertion is erroneous. In the course of representing the City of Los Angeles, I have for the past seventeen years monitored the City's compliance with consent decrees affecting the hiring, promotion, advancement, and assignment of sworn police officers. I have negotiated on the City's behalf two of those decrees. Of those two, Mr. Lee was opposing counsel on the first, and was associated with opposing counsel on the second. None of these decrees mandates the use of racial or gender preferences. In fact, each of them contains provisions forbidding the use of such preferences. 
For the same reasons, the Speaker's statement that the use of racial and gender preferences `would have been a back-door thwarting of the will of the people of California with regard to Proposition 209 (the California Civil Rights Initiative)' is inapposite. Because the decrees with which Mr. Lee was associated do not call for racial or gender preferences, and in fact forbid them, these decrees do not violate the requirements or the intent of Proposition 209. 
Of particular concern to me is the Speaker's reference to `the allegation that Mr. Lee apparently employed dubious means to try to circumscribe the will of the judge in the case.' Thus allegation is wholly untrue. The case being referred to is presently in litigation in the district court. Mr. Lee was not at any time a named counsel in the case, but was associated with opposing counsel because of his involvement in the negotiation of a related consent decree. Neither Mr. Lee nor any opposing counsel attempted in any fashion to thwart the will of the judge supervising the litigation. The matter had been referred by the court to a magistrate judge appointed by the court to assist in the resolution of the case. Each counsel had advised the district judge at all points about the progress of the matter. Upon reconsideration, the district judge elected to assert direct control over the litigation. Nothing in Mr. Lee's conduct reflected any violation of the court's rules, either in fact or by appearance. 
Bill Lann Lee and I have sat on opposite sides of the negotiating table over the course of several years. Although we have disagreed profoundly on many issues, I have throughout the time I have known him respected Bill's candor, his thorough preparation, his sense of ethical behavior, and his ability to bring persons holding diverse views into agreement. He would, in my view, be an outstanding public servant and a worthy addition to the Department of Justice. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert Cramer, Assistant City Attorney.   
City Attorney, Los Angeles, CA, November 4, 1997. 
Hon. Dianne Feinstein, U.S. Senator, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Feinstein: As City Attorney of the City of Los Angeles I feel compelled to correct the inaccurate and defamatory allegations in the October 27th letter from Speaker Newt Gingrich about Bill Lann Lee. 
The Speaker's letter charges that Mr. Lee `attempted to force through a consent decree mandatory racial and gender preferences in the Los Angeles Police Department.' That assertion is wrong. Mr. Lee participated in two lawsuits against the Los Angeles Police Department several years ago that were resolved by consent decrees, but neither decree mandates the use of racial or gender preferences. In fact, each of them contains provisions forbidding the use of preferences. 
What is most outrageous about Mr. Gingrich's letter is his reference to `the allegation that Mr. Lee apparently employed dubious means to try to circumscribe the will of the judge in the case.' There is simply no truth to this allegation. The facts are these. This case, known as Tipton-Whittingham, is presently in litigation in district court. There are serious allegations of discrimination and harassment being made by the plaintiffs in this case who are women police officers in LAPD. Mr. Lee was not at any time a named counsel in the case, but was associated with opposing counsel because of his involvement in the negotiation of a related consent decree. Neither Mr. Lee nor any opposing counsel attempted in any fashion to thwart the will of the judge supervising the litigation. The matter has been referred by the court to a magistrate judge appointed by the court to assist in the resolution of the case. Each counsel had advised the district judge at all points about the progress of the matter. Upon reconsideration, the district judge elected to assert direct control over the litigation. Nothing in Mr. Lee's conduct reflected any violation of the court's rules, either in fact or by appearance. 
Bill Lann Lee and I have been on opposite sides of the negotiating table over the years and we have not always agreed. Yet I respect him for his keen intellect, his profound sense of ethics, and his ability to negotiate an outcome that achieves justice and fairness. 
The United States Senate should not countenance the kind of character assassination based on erroneous information that has occurred in this confirmation process. I'm glad I can help clear the record in this regard. 
Bill Lann Lee is an outstanding lawyer who embodies the highest ethical traditions of that profession and will be vigilant in his defense of the Constitution and the laws of the United States. He should be confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
Very truly yours, 
James K. Hahn, City Attorney.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens; the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Byrd; and the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Mr. McConnell; and all those who worked on it. This has not been an easy time getting this bill through, partly because of holdups in the other body, holdups that tended to disregard, frankly, the democratic process and how we voted here and voted over there. Be that as it may, we have done the best with a difficult situation. I believe this bill should be passed.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak on the issue of funding for international family planning, which is contained in this omnibus bill. 
The agreement on the Mexico City policy that was approved by the Appropriations Committee yesterday, is the result of weeks of tortuous negotiations. It would establish the Mexico City policy in statute for 2 years. That is a major concession to the House that is opposed by the administration. It would permit him to waive the Mexico City restrictions. 
But there is a penalty if he does. Funding for family planning would be frozen at last year's level, which is the House level and $50 million below the Senate level. 
Even with the waiver for the President, I believe that if the Mexico City issue were voted on separately in the Senate it would be defeated. We are including it as part of this larger package in an effort to pass the Foreign Operations conference report. 
It is interesting to me that despite the fact that 5 months ago the Appropriations Committee reported and the Senate voted for $435 million for international family planning programs with no Mexico City restrictions, despite the fact that the Senate voted the same way in February, and the same way last year, despite the fact that the House and Senate Foreign Operations conferees would have overwhelmingly supported the Senate position if the House leadership had allowed them to vote on it, Members of the House are already saying that they will not accept it because it permits the President to waive the Mexico City restrictions. 
Under their approach, the United States could not fund organizations that support laws to make abortion safer in countries where abortion is legal. And they expect the President, and the Secretary of State who is seen around the world as a champion for women's rights, to accept the Mexico City policy. It completely ignores reality. If they are unwilling to budge we are doomed to failure, because their approach would be vetoed. In fact, I cannot even say that the Mexico City policy with a waiver for the President, as we have done, would not be vetoed. 
Mr. President, I was perfectly willing to have a vote in the conference committee, and I am more than willing to vote on this today or next year. 
But the House has been unwilling to do that. They prefer to try to thwart the process in other ways. 
They are all for democracy in Russia. They are outraged when the Haitian Parliament does not follow the rules. But if they do not have the votes here, they break their commitments, 
manipulate the parliamentary rules to their advantage, and obstruct the democratic process. 
Six years ago we had the votes to defeat the Mexico City policy, which was the policy in effect during the previous administration, just as we have the votes in the Senate today. But we knew our position would be vetoed, and that we could not override a veto. 
So rather than bring the Congress to a standstill, we accepted that we could not change the President's policy and we got the Foreign Operations Conference Report passed and signed into law. 
Today the tables are turned. The supporters of Mexico City do not have the votes to get it through the Congress, and even if they did they could not override a veto. 
But rather than accept that, rather than concede that they cannot win a fair fight, they prevented the conference committee from doing its job, they refused an offer to vote when they knew they would lose, and they tried to force their position through so that we would either have to shut down the government again or swallow their position without an opportunity to amend it. 
That is exactly what they did two years ago. The result was that funds for family planning were cut sharply. They tried it again last week, when they sent over the Mexico City policy and tried to jam it through with only Republican names on the Conference Report. They were blocked at the last minute by members of their own party. 
Mr. President, the irony of this is that not one dime of our money can be spent on abortion or to lobby for abortion. That has been the law for years. 
This issue is about what private organizations, like Johns Hopkins University, like Georgetown University, like the University of North Carolina , like the International Planned Parenthood Federation, do with their own money. 
It is about whether we have a policy that says it is okay to give money to foreign governments in countries where abortion is legal, but it is not okay to give money to private organizations that work in those same countries. It is totally illogical and discriminatory. 
The compromise agreement contained in this omnibus bill will make no one happy. I do not like it because it puts into law the Mexico City policy, which I strongly oppose even for two years. Others on this side feel the same way. They see that this is a major concession to the pro-Mexico City faction in the House, and they are right. The administration does not like it either. 
It also means that funding for family planning remains frozen at last year's level of $385 million. That is a $180 million cut from the 1995 level. I think that is a travesty, when so many people around the world want family planning services and cannot get them. Not abortion. Family planning, so they don't have to resort to abortion. 
That is the choice. In Russia, where women had on average 7 abortions in their lifetimes because they had no access to family planning, that number has fallen sharply since we started a family planning program there. It is common sense. 
I would like to see twice this amount of money going for family planning, but we have agreed to this level, which is a $50 million cut from the amount that passed the Senate in July, as part of this agreement to try to finish these appropriations bills. 
Mr. President, the House can reject this approach. Perhaps they do not believe the President when he says he will veto the Mexico City policy. I do not know how many times he has to say it. 
It was not easy to get here. When there is a Republican in the White House, or the votes change in the Senate, I am sure the other side will want to vote because they will be confident of victory. But that is not where we are today. 
I hope the House can improve on this approach. I would be overjoyed if they can find a way to keep the Mexico City policy out of the law entirely, without including the kind of harmful restrictions on the disbursement of family planning funds that were adopted last year. If the supporters of the Mexico City policy want it so badly, why not vote on it? 
As I have said time and again, I would prefer to handle this by voting on Mexico City next year. We could agree that if it is defeated in the Senate, the funds would be disbursed on a quarterly basis through the 1998 fiscal year. I know that approach has bipartisan support in the House. In fact, the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee has suggested that approach. Whether it could win a majority I do not know, but I encourage the House to pursue it.

Mr. LEAHY. It is, but it is not what I would want. I would prefer to be far closer to what the Senate has voted on time and time and time again. 
I understand the realities of the situation, though, and this is where we are. The irony is that those who are holding up family planning money, claiming they are doing it because of their opposition to abortion, are assuring that there will be more abortions in the countries we send the family planning money to. 
The family planning money, in so many of these countries, has provided a strong alternative to abortion, because many countries use abortion as a method of birth control. Our family planning money would cut down abortions. It has been proven. 
For the life of me, I cannot understand this topsy-turvy, `Alice in Wonderland,' view of cutting family planning money and saying we are trying to stop abortions, because its does nothing of the kind. In fact, when people have access to family planning, the abortions go down.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in one of the newspapers I was reading this morning, there was an editorial speaking about the U.S. position in saying that they will work to lead an effort toward the demining of antipersonnel landmines around the world, an effort that is already well underway in a number of countries, which is supported partly by the United States in the millions of dollars in humanitarian demining efforts. 
I agree with the President. I agree with the administration's efforts to seek more money for demining. 
We have so many millions of landmines in the ground in 60 to 70 countries that nobody even knows how many landmines are out there. Very often the way we find out where they are is when a child or some other noncombatant steps on a landmine, touches a landmine, and is either crippled, maimed, or killed from the explosion. 
We also know, whether these are $3, $4, or $5 antipersonnel landmines stuck in the ground, they can cost a considerable amount of money to take them back out depending on where they are --anywhere from an average of $100 on up to as much as $1,000 per landmine. 
I agree that the United States, as the most powerful and wealthiest Nation on the Earth, should do everything possible to try to take landmines out of the ground. But I note the obvious, Mr. President. It is like trying to bail out the ocean, if you continue to put new landmines down. 
Next month, in Ottawa, over 100 nations will come together to sign a treaty banning the placement and use of antipersonnel landmines. One of the most notable exceptions to the signers will be the United States of America. I think that is a bad mistake. I think if the United States wishes to have leadership and credibility on this issue they should do both--help in the demining, but do the right thing, and that is help stop further mining. 
Until the use of antipersonnel landmines is treated the same way we treat the use of chemical weapons then we will continue to see them and we will continue to see the use of antipersonnel landmines against innocent civilians. They have become more and more--if not exclusively, at least primarily--a weapon against civilians. Worse than that, they are weapons that stay long after the war is over. Peace agreements are signed, tanks pull away, guns are unloaded, armies march away, and 5 years later a child on the way to school is destroyed and nobody even remembers who was fighting, nobody knows who put the weapon there. 
I just mention, Mr. President, while I support our continued efforts to demine and while I take pride in writing much of the legislation to get the money for the United States to be involved in humanitarian demining up to this point, I note it falls short of the ultimate goal until we have a real ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friend from Mississippi has raised the issue of the appropriations bills. Senators, as he knows, have been working very, very hard on that--the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Byrd, and those of us who are either ranking or chairmen of the appropriate subcommittees that are involved, in this case three key ones. 
Mr. President, I note, as we have discussed privately, that there will not be a perfect piece of appropriations legislation, I say to my friend from Mississippi, from anyone's point of view. It is not precisely what he would write if he were to write it solely by himself; it is not precisely what I would write if I wrote it solely by myself, and we could say that with the other 98 men and women in this body. 
At some point, when you are down to the last few hours of the session, we have to allow the committee system and the leadership system to work, where senior Members, especially of appropriations, where senior Members in both parties, in both bodies have to come together and reach an agreement, realizing that not every single Member on the left or on the right is going to like it. But you have to trust at some point some question of seniority in putting this together. 
I didn't care much for the seniority system when I came here 23 years ago, but having studied it for 23 years, I understand it so much better now. I say to my friend, the majority leader, and I think he would agree with me, that in the last few days of the session, especially with appropriations, you are not going to get a bill that is going to please every single Member 100 percent, but we have to get something done because at some point you have to fish or cut bait. 
I just mention that because I know the distinguished majority leader has been working as hard on this as anybody else to get us to this point.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I delighted that the Senate is about to pass the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997, S. 1189. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation. 
This legislation would provide greater protection to Federal judges, law enforcement officers and their families. Specifically, our legislation would: increase the maximum prison term for forcible assaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation or interference with a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 years imprisonment to 8 years; increase the maximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily injury against a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase the maximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member of the immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the Department of Justice, the United States Judicial Conference, the United States Sentencing Commission and the United States Marshal Service. 
It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs this legislation to protect the hard working men and women who serve in our Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, unfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence against officials of our Federal government. 
Earlier this year, for example, a courtroom in Urbana, Illinois was firebombed, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This follows the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the federal office building in Oklahoma City two years ago. More recently in my home state, a Vermont border patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl Drega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement officers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that day, Drega shot and killed two state troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. Apparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the judge who had ruled against him in a land dispute. 
I had a chance to visit John Pfeiffer in the hospital and met his wife and young daughter. Thankfully, Agent Pfeiffer has returned to work along the Vermont border. As a federal law enforcement officer, Agent Pfeiffer and his family will receive greater protection under our bill. 
There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking the law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or law enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshal Service is concerned with more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement officers. 
The extreme rhetoric that some are using to attack the judiciary only feeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives was recently quoted as saying: `The judges need to be intimidated,' and if they do not behave, `we're going to go after them in a big way.' I know that House Republican Whip Tom DeLay was not intending to encourage violence against any Federal official, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal judges in the eyes of the public. 
Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate and violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve within it with the respect that is essential to its preserving its public standing. 
We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people and countries around the world that are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment. 
We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the Federal Judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public servants that make up the federal government, who are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that it takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal Judiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that these are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. They deserve our respect and our protection.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the lifetime of service that Mary Miller has given to the state of Vermont. I have been fortunate to have had Mary in my Montpelier office, working for the people of Vermont for 17 years. Anyone involved in rural development, small business, or affordable housing has undoubtedly seen for themselves her whole-hearted commitment to these issues which are so important for our small state. Even before joining my staff Mary was working to improve the lives of her fellow Vermonters through her service to Common Cause, and as a state legislator for her home base in Rutland County. 
It is difficult to put into words Mary's boundless energy, her enthusiasm--and her ability to simultaneously make Vermonters feel good about what they are doing while helping them achieve their goals. At times I have felt that members of Congress are only Constitutional impediments to our staff. Mary is a humbling case in point. I have met hundreds of thousands of Vermonters over the past 25 years. I have been to every corner of the state many times over--and it's fair to say that often more people recognize Mary than recognize me. Sometimes it is not even close. 
There is no mud season too miserable, no pothole too large, and no snowfall too deep to keep Mary from meeting with Vermonters. I remember one spring in particular when she traveled for miles over muddy, rutted dirt roads to meet a small business owner who had benefitted from one of the revolving loan funds I have worked to set up around the state. As I recall, in this particular case the owner was not home, but his dog was and gave her quite a reception. He may be the only revolving loan fund recipient in the state that Mary has not met, and even his dog would recognize her. 
Despite this outreach schedule, that would put many of her chronologically challenged co-workers to shame, Mary has always found time for fun. Even as she approaches the age when more conventional people are thinking about retirement, Mary is planning her next white water rafting trip. 
I know I am not alone in saying that I will miss her lively presence in the office. I will miss her colorful reports on the weather which close out the daily press brief and her unflagging support for the Red Sox. But I don't plan on letting her get away too easily--I have Mary's e-mail address and it will be well used. 
Mary is not retiring, just shifting her focus to new challenges, such as the mountains yet to be climbed, rivers yet to be rafted, grandchildren yet to be born. I know that her husband Sam is looking forward to seeing more of Mary as much as I regret seeing her leave. Vermont is lucky to have had Mary to itself for all these years.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator is aware that we seem to go off on things that are not very urgent, whereas we don't take time for things that are urgent. 
For example, the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. All the members of the Judiciary Committee on this side of the aisle have asked the chairman for another hearing on Bill Lann Lee, because it is obvious from the debate we had on Thursday in the committee that misstatements of facts have been used, distortion of his record have been used. We find that people supposedly opposing Bill Lann Lee, in fact, support him. We find the cases in which he was involved were misconstrued. 
So I just mention this, if we want to do something worthwhile, then I hope the Judiciary Committee and the chairman will stop refusing to have another hearing and will listen to all of us who have asked for another hearing out of fairness to a man who has been much maligned. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and yield back to him to answer the question.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I remain frustrated by the Republican leadership's unwillingness to consider and approve the President's nomination of Ray Fisher to the third-highest ranking position at the U.S. Department of Justice. Mr. Fisher has been stalled on the Senate Calendar for a month since being reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on October 9. 
Ray Fisher is an outstanding lawyer and public servant. His record is exemplary. 
Is this another example of a secret hold? There has been no explanation of justification for this delay and lack of action. 
I recall when the Senate Republican leadership delayed the vote on the nomination of Eric Holder to the Deputy Attorney General position that we were told there were Senators with problems. I also remember that when I insisted on a rollcall vote on that nomination, after it had been stalled on the Senate Calendar for more than 3 weeks, the problems had all been resolved and the Senate confirmed Mr. Holder unanimously. One hundred Senators voted for that nomination. 
I urge the Republican leadership to allow the Senate to confirm Ray Fisher to be Associate Attorney General of the United States.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a small organization whose existence shows that a few determined individuals can make a difference. I am referring to the Marine Corps--Law Enforcement Foundation, which was formed in February 1995 by five former Marines who decided over lunch one day to help the children of Marines and Federal law enforcement employees. 
Less than 3 years after forming, this organization has given away nearly $1.5 million to more than 150 children. The group focuses on the educational and special needs of children who have no where else to turn. They have paid for a hearing aid for a young son of a Marine whose insurance did not cover it. They provided a wheelchair to a ninth grader injured playing football. They gave $250,000 to children whose parents were Federal employees killed or injured in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. 
Mr. President, I know several of the founding members of this foundation personally, and I want to say that I was not surprised to hear about the success of their collaboration. As Edmund Burke once said, `Great men are the guideposts and landmarks in the state.' We can all learn something from them.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor S. 170, the clone Pager authorization Act, and urge its speedy passage. This bill would enable law enforcement officers to gain quicker and easier access to an important investigatory tool, called a clone pager, which has proven invaluable in gathering evidence against gang members, drug traffickers and organized crime members. 
I was pleased to have helped improve this bill from the version introduced in the last congress. We included it in the juvenile crime bill, S. 15, that I sponsored along with other Democratic Members on the first day of this session and which the Democratic leader designated among our top legislative priorities. 
While pagers are, of course, used legitimately by millions of people, these devices are relied upon by gangsters and drug dealers to carry on their illicit business from roving offices that enable time to commit crimes no matter where they are at any time of day or night. Indeed, pagers are so popular among drug traffickers, these devices are considered a regular tool of the drug trade. 
A clone pager is programmed identically to the pager used by a suspected criminal so that it displays the same numbers transmitted to, and displayed on, the suspect's pager. A law enforcement officer using the clone pager is thereby able to receive the identical pager message at the same time as the targeted criminal. 
How does this help law enforcement? When a drug dealer moves about town conducting his illicit business, he can keep in constant touch with his criminal associates, including his drug suppliers and customers, by carrying a pager. Contacting the dealer wherever he may be is a simple matter of calling his pager. The drug dealer can then pull up to the nearest public telephone to return the call at the number displayed on his pager. A clone pager, which simultaneously displays the same call-back numbers received by the targeted drug dealer, alerts law enforcement officers to the telephone numbers used by the dealer's suppliers and associates, and through those numbers, their locations. 
To determine the telephone numbers of associates called by, or calling to, a criminal suspect's land-line or cellular telephone, law enforcement officers use a pen register or trap and trace device. Yet, when criminals opt to conduct their business using pagers-- often times to thwart police surveillance--law enforcement officers must obtain authority under the wiretap law to use a clone pager. Even though clone pagers reveal essentially the same information about the telephone numbers of associates calling the suspect as do pen register and trap and trace devices, the procedures for wiretap authorization are significantly more complicated and more time--consuming than those to obtain authority for use of pen register and trap and trace devices. The additional procedural hurdles necessary to use clone pagers benefit only the criminal. 
This bill would permit law enforcement to use a clone pager based on the same form of court authorization necessary to use a pen register or trap and trace device. In fact, certain of the requirements for wiretap authorization simply make no sense when the investigatory tool being authorized is a clone numeric pager. 
Thus, courts confronted with defense motions to suppress evidence derived from clone pagers for failure to comply with wiretap procedures have concluded that certain statutory requirements for wiretaps do not apply. For example, since clone numeric pagers do not reveal the content of any conversation or even whether any conversation actually occurred, courts have found that it is impossible to minimize clone numeric pager interceptions as is required for interceptions of wire, oral or electronic communications. See, e.g., U.S. v. Bautista, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 16829, 7 (4th Cir. 1992); U.S. v. tutino, 883 F.2d 1125, 1141 (2d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1081 (1990) (`minimization requirements cannot reasonably be applied to clone beepers'); U.S. v. Gambino, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10689, 7 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). 
Furthermore, since the numbers captured from clone numeric pagers are usually manually, rather than electronically or mechanically, recorded by law enforcement officers, courts have concluded that the recordation and sealing requirements of the wiretap law have limited utility and refused to suppress for failure to comply with these requirements. U.S. v. Suarez, 906 F.2d 977, 984 (4th Cir. 1990) U.S. v. Paredes-Moya, 722 F. Supp. 1402, 1408 (N.D. Tex. 1989). 
Instead of providing fodder for defense motions, the time is long overdue for Congress to apply common sense and require law enforcement to follow more appropriate procedures--no more and no less--to obtain authorization to use clone numeric pagers. 
this bill would conform the requirements to obtain legal authorization for use of a clone pager to those for use of a pen register or trap and trace device. As one court recognized, 
`[u]nlike telephone wiretaps, duplicate paging devices reveal only numbers, not the content of conversation. In this way they are similar to pen registers.' U.S. v. Tutino, supra, 883 F.2d at 1141. Specifically, the bill would authorize a Federal court to issue an order authorizing the use of a clone numeric display pager to receive the communications intended for another such pager, upon certification of an attorney for the government or law enforcement officer that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
This new authority would be limited to clone numeric display pagers, not more sophisticated pagers that transmit and receive written or oral textual messages. The only communications obtained from, and displayed on, clone numeric display pagers are numbers dialed into a telephone for transmission to the suspect's pager--just like the information obtained from a pen register or trap and trace device. 
These numbers usually are callback telephone numbers, but may also include other incidental or coded numbers. Such incidental or coded numbers are also captured by pen register or trap and trace devices. The capturing of incidental or coded numbers by pen registers prompted Congress to require in the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA] that technology `reasonably available' be used to restrict the recording or decoding of numbers to the `dialing or signaling information utilized in call processing.' 18 U.S.C. 3121(c). 
Tone-only paging devices are already completely exempt from the wiretap law, as amended in 1986 by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act [ECPA]. The ECPA extended the protections of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (`Title III') to unauthorized interceptions of `electronic communications.' My main purpose in sponsoring ECPA was, as the Senate Report indicates, `to update and clarify Federal privacy protections and standards in light of dramatic changes in new computer and telecommunications technologies.' S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, reprinted in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 3555, 3555. Alphanumeric display pagers, which visually display both numbers and letters, and sophisticated tone and voice pagers should, in my view, continue to be subject to the wiretap authorization procedures. The nature of the communication captured by numeric display pagers, however, is so akin to the information obtained by pen register and trap and trace devices, that the procedures and standards for their authorized use by law enforcement should be equalized. 
As criminals use technological advances for their own ill purposes, Congress must continue, as we did with ECPA and CALEA, to give law enforcement the reasonable authority it needs to keep up, while protecting legitimate privacy interests. This bill does so, and I support its passage. 
Passage of this bill will not mean the end of our work in this area, however. The judicial role in approving the use of pen register and trap and trace devices is severely limited and, in fact, relegates judges to merely a ministerial role. U.S. v. Fregoso, 60 F.3d 1314, 1320 (8th Cir. 1995); U.S. v. Hallmark, 911 F.2d 399, 402 (10th cir. 1990); In re Order Authorizing Installation of Pen Reg., 846 F. Supp. 1555, 1558-59 (M.D. Fla. 1994). The court's limited role is to confirm, first, the identity of the applicant and investigating law enforcement agency, and second, certification from the applicant that the information sought is relevant to an ongoing investigation. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3121-3127. 
Significantly, the judge is not authorized to review, let alone question, the basis for the relevancy determination. If the appropriate certification appears, the judge must authorize the pen register or trap and trace device. This is an anomalous limitation on the judicial role. While relevance to an ongoing criminal investigation remains an appropriate basis for use of a pen register or trap and trace device, Congress should reexamine the limitation on judicial authority to review this determination. This remains unfinished business.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to see that the Senate is finally turning its attention to the nomination of Christina Snyder. She was first nominated in May 1996, over 17 months ago. Her hearing was finally held in July of this year and after another 2-month delay, she was reported by the Judiciary Committee without objection. She has been pending on the Senate Calendar without action and without any explanation for the 2-month delay that has since ensued. 
It seems that the delay in considering her nomination had nothing to do with her outstanding qualifications or temperament or ability to serve as a Federal judge. Rather, it seems that some opposed this fine woman and held up her nomination to a very busy court because she had encouraged lawyers to be involved in pro bono activities. 
Ms. Snyder has been held up anonymously for months and months. When the Judiciary Committee finally met to consider her nomination, I was curious to learn who and what had delayed her confirmation for over a year. But no one spoke against her and no one voted against her. 
Ms. Snyder has been an outstanding lawyer, a member of the American Law Institute, and someone who contributes to the community and has lived the ethical consideration under Canon 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. I congratulate her on her outstanding career. 
When she was being interrogated about her membership on the boards of Public Counsel and the Western Center on Law and Public Interest, Senator Feingold properly observed: 
[I]t is kind of an irony when we get to the day where if you don't participate in pro bono activities, you are somehow in a situation where your record is a little safer vis a vis being appointed to a Federal judgeship. And then when you get involved in pro bono activity, that might actually cause you to get a few more questions. . . . [T]hat can't be an encouragement for lawyers to get involved in pro bono activities on behalf of people who don't have the ability to go to court very easily. 
After all these months, I was please to hear Senator Sessions pronounce Ms. Snyder `an outstanding individual with a fine record' and `a capable lawyer of integrity and ability,' when her nomination was considered by the Judiciary Committee. 
I congratulate Ms. Snyder and her family and look forward to her service on the Federal court. 
Although I am delighted that the Senate will today be confirming Christina Snyder as a Federal district court judge, the Republican leadership has once again passed over and refused to take up the nomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest pending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, having languished on the Senate Calendar since June 12. 
The central district of California desperately needs this vacancy filled, which has been open for more than 18 months, and Margaret Morrow is eminently qualified to fill it. Thus, while the Senate is finally proceeded to fill one of the judicial emergency vacancies that has plagued the U.S. District Court for the central district of California, it continues to shirk its duty with respect to the other judicial emergency vacancy, that for which Margaret Morrow was nominated on May 9, 1996. 
Just 2 week's ago, the opponents of this nomination announced in a press conference that they welcomed a debate and rollcall vote on Margaret Morrow. But again the Republican majority leader has refused to bring up this well-qualified nominee for such debate and vote. It appears that Republicans have time for press conferences to attack one of the President's judicial nominations, but the majority leader will not allow the U.S. Senate to turn to that nomination for a vote. We can discuss the nomination in sequential press conferences and weekend talk show appearances but not in the one place that action must be taken on it, on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
The Senate has suffered through hours of quorum calls in the past few weeks which time would have been better spent debating and voting on this judicial nomination. The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are puzzling--not only to those of us in the Senate who know her record but to those who know her best in California, including many Republicans. 
They cannot fathom why a few senators have decided to target someone as well-qualified and as moderate as she is. Just this week I included in the Congressional Record a recent article from the Los Angeles Times by Henry Weinstein on the nomination of Margaret Morrow, entitled `Bipartisan Support Not Enough for Judicial Nominee.' This article documents the deep and widespread bipartisan support that Margaret Morrow enjoys from Republicans that know her. In fact, these Republicans are shocked that some Senators have attacked Ms. Morrow. 
For example, Sheldon H. Sloan, a former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and an associate of Gov. Pete Wilson, declared that: `My party has the wrong woman in their sights.' Stephen S. Trott, a former high-ranking official in the Reagan administration and now a Court of Appeals Judge wrote to the majority leader to try to free up the Morrow nomination, according to this article Judge Trott informed Senator Lott: 
`I know that you are concerned, and properly so, about the judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench. So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means: follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes. Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a judicial position.' 
Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration, observed in the article that: `Margaret has gotten tangled in a web of larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere pawn in this struggle.' I could not agree more.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a court decision was issued recently which could throw the entire system of supplying milk to consumers into chaos and could lead to dramatically higher milk prices for consumers. 
This decision was a runaway ruling that jeopardizes the survival of thousands of dairy farmers outside the Midwest. 
The current milk marketing order system assures local milk production and reliable supplies of fresh and wholesome local milk.' 
The system is designed, according to the Congressional Research Service, to avoid `shortages of milk,' and `to assure consumers of adequate and dependable supplies of pure and wholesome fluid milk.' 
In this respect, America is the envy of many nations in the world which have unreliable milk supplies shipped in from distant locations at high prices because there is no local competition. 
Price differentials, which were struck down in this decision, help keep local producers in business, help cover the costs of transporting fluid milk, and avoid shortages of milk in supermarkets, according to CRS. 
Common sense tells us that the cost of producing and transporting milk varies from region to region. A flat pricing system is flat-out wrong. 
I joined with 47 of my colleagues recently in sending a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture urging him to keep the current system which assures local supplies of fresh milk to millions of American families. 
The key to this system that has worked so well for decades is under attack--once again--in Minnesota. 
It is no secret that Northern Midwestern States want to provide milk to the Nation. New technology is available where they can `drain' the water out of their milk, ship the resulting concentrate, and then reconstitute the milk at distant locations. 
Over time, this new concentration of the dairy industry in Northern Midwestern States could put thousands of dairy farmers out of business around the Nation. I am very afraid that, ultimately, prices to consumers will rise as the supply of milk becomes more and more concentrated in one area of the country. 
My major fear is that when Midwestern winter storms blanket roads with snow, or when freezing conditions in the North stop traffic on the interstates, or when there is a trucker's strike, that consumers in the rest of the country are going to feel lucky if they can buy milk for just $5 a gallon. Parents who need milk for children might want to pay a lot more than $5 a gallon, if they could buy milk at any price. 
I do not think consumers are going to like this system of being dependent on reconstituted milk being shipped in from 1,000 miles away at who knows what price. 
Our current system of encouraging local production of milk works very well for consumers. USDA has been right to promote the local production of fresh milk instead of this system of concentrating the industry in one region and then shipping products to be reconstituted into milk later. 
The Court's ruling--unless stayed--will be effective almost immediately. the order will not have a great deal of effect in states fortunate enough to be in Northeast Dairy Compact, or in states that have their own milk order system such as California. 
In those states, local dairy farmers should be able to stay in business and provide towns and cities with local, fresh supplies of milk. 
When disasters, or winter storms hit, consumers in these areas will be able to buy milk. 
USDA must appeal the decision immediately--no ifs, ands, or buts. The existence of thousands of dairy farmers is at stake. 
It is unclear to me precisely which order regions will be affected by the Court order. The Order terminates Class I differentials in `all surplus and balanced marketing orders and all deficit orders that do not rely on direct shipments of alternative milk supplies from the Upper Midwest or from other deficit orders which in turn rely on the Upper Midwest for replacement supplies.' 
A balanced market is one with sufficient milk to meet demand plus a 40% reserve. A surplus market produces milk in excess of the demand and reserve percentage. 
Thus, a few Southeastern states may be exempt from the Order. 
For states like New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and some Southeastern states, and southern Midwestern states, impact of the Order should come swiftly as banks decline to make loans to dairy farmers. 
The expectation is that producer income will drop significantly and that farmers would go out of business as lenders refuse to provide credit. 
Prices in the Northern Midwest could strengthen 20 to 30 cents per hundredweight (one-hundred pounds) sold--but it is too early to really know how much their prices would go up. 
This action was originally filed some years ago by Eric Olsen, Patricia Jensen, James Massey and Lynn Hayes representing the Farmers Legal Aid Action Group. It was filed before the Honorable Judge David S. Doty of the Fourth Division for the District of Minnesota. 
Mr. President, I know that my distinguished colleague from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, will also be addressing the Senate on the same issue. Again, It is about a court decision that was issued recently which could throw the entire system of supplying milk to consumers into chaos and could also lead to dramatically higher milk prices for consumers. 
The decision was a runaway ruling that jeopardizes the survival of thousands of dairy farmers everywhere except the Midwest. 
Now, the current milk marketing order system, which is a very complex one, assures local milk production, and it assures reliable supplies of fresh and wholesome local milk. In this respect, we are the envy here in the United States of most nations of the world. Most nations have unreliable milk supplies that are shipped in from distant locations at high prices, because there is no local competition. Common sense tells us that the cost of producing and transporting milk varies from region to region. You can't have a flatout pricing system that is the same everywhere. 
Now, again, I joined with 47 other Senators recently in sending a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture urging him to keep the current system, which assures local supplies of fresh milk to millions of Americans. It's no secret that northern Midwestern States want to provide all the milk to the Nation. They have a technology where they take all the water out of their milk and you get this kind of `glop' that is left, and you ship it to distant places and somebody pumps some water back into it, and you end up with this reconstituted milk, which they can then sell. If you do that, what is going to happen is that the `glop" producers of this reconstituted milk will all be in one part of the country and the rest of us will be everywhere else in the country. The rest of the country will be at their mercy, depending upon when, how often, and at what price they want to send this concentrate to us. 
Now, my major fear is--especially coming from a part of the country that has severe winters--what happens when the Midwestern winter storms blanket roads with snow, or you get the freezing conditions in the North and that stops traffic on the Interstates? It happens fairly often. Or what happens when there is a truckers' strike? When that happens, I think you are going to find consumers in the country feeling lucky they can buy milk for $5 a gallon. Parents who need milk for their children might have to pay a lot more than $5 a gallon if they have to buy milk at whatever price. Whatever price they get it for, it is going to be the reconstituted `glop' coming to that area--and water is going to have to be added--from producers from a thousand miles away. I don't think this makes much sense. I like the system we have today, which encourages producers in a number of different areas of the country where they can produce fresh milk for the consumers at prices they can afford. 
Now, the court's ruling will be effective immediately. It is not going to have a great deal of effect on the States in the Northeast dairy compact or States who have their own milk order system, such as California. In those States, local dairy farmers should be able to stay in business and provide local, fresh supplies of milk. When disasters and winter storms hit, consumers in those areas will be able to get milk. What I worry about is all the other areas. 
The Department of Agriculture has to appeal this decision immediately--no ifs, ands, or buts. The existence of thousands of dairy farmers is at stake. USDA has to act for these farmers and for the consumers. 
Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague from Vermont on the floor. I now yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for deciding to take up the nomination of Jerry Friedman to serve as a judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. Judge Friedman's nomination was received by the Judiciary Committee on June 26, 1997. He appeared before us during a nomination hearing on October 28 and was reported favorably out of the committee on November 6. 
From June 1985 to January 1991, Judge Friedman sat on the bench of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in Virginia Beach, VA. Since 1991, he has served as a judge for the Virginia Beach Circuit Court. The American Bar Association gave Judge Friedman a unanimous `well-qualified' evaluation--its highest rating. 
I would like to congratulate both Judge Friedman and his family. I look forward to his service on the U.S. District Court.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, so I will take the 5 minutes on this side. 
Obviously, this is a case where, I assume, Ronald Gilman will be confirmed, and I congratulate him. 
I am pleased that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Ronald L. Gilman to be a judge for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Gilman currently works as a partner for Farris, Mathews, Gilman, Branan & Hellen, P.L.C. in Memphis, TN, an adjunct professor of trial advocacy for the University of Memphis Law School, an arbitrator and mediator for the American Arbitration Association in Nashville, TN, an arbitrator and mediator for the National Association of Securities Dealers in Chicago, IL, and as a dalkon shield referee for the Private Adjudication Center in Cary, NC. The ABA gave Mr. Gilman its highest evaluation--a unanimous well qualified rating. 
In addition to his paid legal service, Mr. Gilman currently volunteers on behalf of the Memphis, TN and American Bar Associations, the Association of Attorney-Mediators and the Commercial Law Affiliates. 
I congratulate Mr. Gilman and his family, and I look forward to his service on the Sixth Circuit of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals. 
I am also delighted that the Judiciary Committee plans to consider 15 judicial nominations at its executive business meeting today. I am hopeful that these nominations may be considered by the full Senate before we adjourn for the year. 
Mr. President, we have seen this time and time again where judges are held up because people are concerned about them, we are told, and then we have a rollcall vote on them and virtually every Senator votes for them. I mention this because no matter how many times we are told that we have to look very carefully at these judges, that they have concerns about them, it is obvious the Senate is not concerned about them and the Senate votes for them. 
The same thing has happened with Bill Lann Lee. It is a case where the whole Senate would vote for Bill Lann Lee, that he would be confirmed overwhelmingly as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, but a small ideological group has decided that while they could not defeat Bill Lann Lee on the floor, a minority of the minority would try to defeat him and vote to block him in committee. 
It seems the Republican leadership is determined to sacrifice Bill Lann Lee to narrow ideological politics. If the Republican leadership were to allow the Senate to vote on this outstanding nominee, a majority of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, would vote to confirm him. Unfortunately, the press accounts this morning are that conservative Republicans have decided to block him by a minority of the minority. They have vowed not to allow this nomination to be considered by the Senate before adjournment this year. 
This is not democracy. This is not the Senate at its best. This is the Senate at its worst, twisting the rules. The reason the Republican leadership gives for trying to kill this nomination is that Bill Lann Lee agrees with the President. It is not so much about Bill Lee as Bill Clinton. The President won election, and he won reelection. For the Senate to refuse to proceed to this nomination because Mr. Lee honestly testified that he would adhere to policies of equal justice consistent with those of the President is wrong. 
Mr. President, can we have order, please? I cannot hear myself.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. The Republican leaders were prodded into this by the narrow ideological extreme right of their party and its allies. They have not brought forward their own bill on affirmative action. They want to talk about it, but they have not brought it forward because they know a majority of Republicans and Democrats would not vote for it. 
The Proposition 209 case is over. The Supreme Court has ruled on that. The good people of Houston rejected efforts to abandon those previously discriminated against. So there is nothing left for the extreme right except one trophy, and that trophy is Bill Lann Lee. 
What kind of an example does this set? What kind of signal does this send? Bill Lee's life story is an American success story. He is the son of immigrants who struggled against discrimination. His father fought with the American forces in World War II. He spent his professional career working to solve civil rights problems and diffuse conflict. His record of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor, as even those opposing him have to concede. 
When he said to the Judiciary Committee that quotas are illegal and wrong and he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about his resolve to do what is right. He is a person with great problem-solving skills. Such matters are too important to be used for political purposes or as wedge issues to divide people. What is promising about this nomination is that Bill Lee is the person with the credentials, credibility and creativity to help move America and all Americans forward. 
Any fairminded review of his 23-year career shows him to be well-suited to head the Civil Rights Division. It shows where he has been and where the law has been and how we have moved forward to refine remedial approaches to discrimination and its vestiges. One measure of this extraordinary individual are the testimonies of support provided by so many of his litigation opponents over the years, support based on his fairness and good sense, support from Democrats and Republicans alike. 
Just this summer, the Senate moved forward to confirm another Assistant Attorney General, someone who had expressly declined to follow the language of the Telecommunications Act House-Senate conference report and raised concerns among a number of Senators. We were told that the standard to be employed in evaluating these nominees was not to hold a nominee hostage to policy differences with the administration but to vote for the nominee, if well-qualified, to permit the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed division chief, and for us in Congress to move forward and work with the administration in the formulation and implementation of effective policies. 
Unfortunately, with this nomination, that of the first Asian-American to head the Civil Rights Division, the rules are being changed and the standards are being moved. First, it appeared that the Republicans wished to raise their concerns with the nominee and point out their differences with administration policy, as is traditionally done. Then the focus was on Mr. Lee's possible involvement in Supreme Court consideration of the California proposition 209 case. When Mr. Lee came forward and recused himself from involvement in that case, the suggestion was made that the Department of Justice abstain from filing a brief in that case should certiorari be granted. 
That suggestion was properly rejected. Indeed, I would think that the Supreme Court would be likely to request the views of the U.S. Government if they were not tendered in an amicus brief. Surely imposition of this suggested gag rule on the United States on issues of significance and concern in order to confirm a nominee who would not even be involved in formulating the U.S. position would have been ill-advised. 
This week the Supreme Court denied review in the California proposition 209 case. If Bill Lee's recusal did not clear the way for his confirmation surely, one would have thought, this action by the Supreme Court removed the immediate obstacle that had been fastened on by the opposition. Instead, the grounds for opposition shifted. It now appears that in order to be confirmed to lead the Civil Rights Division, the nominee must not only commit to uphold the law but disavow the President who has nominated him to serve in this administration. Before we are done I expect that the nominee would be required to endorse S. 950, a bill that the Senate has not considered nor the Congress enacted. 
I think it beneath Senators to suggest that this fine nominee ought be rejected because a previous, unqualified Republican nominee had been rejected by the committee. Tit for tat may be the rule in the alley, but should not govern the actions of the U.S. Senate. Nonetheless, there seems to be a lot of pay back motivating those opposing this fine man. 
I regret that a narrow, ideological litmus test is being proposed that would require nominees to disavow remedies and approaches that the Supreme Court has held to be constitutional and necessary to enforce our commitment to equal opportunity. It is the administration's commitment to affirmative action and equal justice that would have to be sacrificed. I know that Bill Lee would not compromise his commitment to enforce the law and to seek equal justice for all Americans. 
Moreover, if accepted by a partisan majority, that political litmus test will know no natural limit. It could infect the confirmation of the Associate Attorney General, the Solicitor General and all other nominations. 
I regret that some have decided to oppose this good man. He would, in my view, enforce the law, use his problem-solving skills and proven ability to move the country forward and build on the progress that we have been able to make in remedying past discrimination over the last several years. It appears now that for this nomination to prevail in Committee it will take a profile in courage by a couple Republican members. I urge each member to consider his or her vote carefully and what it means for this nomination, for the country and for standards being created for future nominations. 
There is a place to consider the important issues involved in the debate over race relations in the country and the constitutionality of affirmative action that the Supreme Court has held to be constitutional. That should not be the issue with respect to the vote on this nominee, however. 
When Bill Lee appeared before the Committee with his family he testified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He articulated to us that he understands that as the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division his client is the United States and all of its people. He told us poignantly about why he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all when he spoke of the treatment that his parents received as immigrants. Mr. Lee told us how in spite of his father's personal treatment and experiences, William Lee remained a fierce American patriot, volunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II and never lost his belief in America. 
He inspired his son just as Bill Lee now inspires his own children and countless others across the land. They are the kind of everyday heroes to whom we sing praises. 
Mr. Lee told us:  
`My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.' 
I know that Bill Lee will remain true to all that his father taught him and hope that the momentary ugliness of people opposing his nomination based on an ideological litmus test of people distorting his achievements and beliefs and of some succumbing to narrow partisanship will not be his reward for a career of good works. Such treatment drives good people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate. 
I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the Nation. In this case, I am afraid that the Senate may show no conscience. 
I call on the Senate's Republican leadership to end their targeting of Bill Lann Lee and to work with us to bring this nomination to the floor without obstruction so that the Senate may vote and we may confirm a fine person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. 
Why this exemplary Asian-American is singled out, a man who has shown far more qualities than most people and could easily be confirmed, I cannot understand. To allow somebody's career, to allow somebody who has lived the American dream, to allow somebody who has demonstrated what is best about this country, to allow the Senate to react to what is worst about this country in defeating him is absolutely wrong. It is a shame on the Senate. It is a shame on the country. It is a shame on all of us if we allow this to happen. The worst part of that shame, Mr. President, is that if the Senate were allowed to vote on Bill Lann Lee, he would be confirmed, because most Senators in both parties would not allow this shame to go on. Why an ideological ultraright would stop it I cannot understand.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with President Clinton's goal of creating economic growth through more export opportunities, but I must vote against this legislation to renew fast-track authority because it fails to protect our workers and our environment. 
I understand that exports are a key ingredient of Vermont's economic growth. As a small State, we must rely on selling our products beyond the Green Mountains. Exports give Vermonters the opportunity to create good jobs right here in Vermont through rising trade. For instance, Cabot Creamery recently made headlines by selling its Vermont-made cheddar cheese in London, England. 
Vermonters are reaping the benefits of more open markets around the world, where we can sell our high quality goods. Since 1992, Vermont exports are up 29 percent, with 70,000 Vermonters now working in export-related jobs. On a per capita basis, Vermont is the largest exporter of goods among the 50 States. We just need to look at the Vermont expansion of Husky, a Canadian company with European plants, to understand the importance of trade in the world economy. 
I will continue to work with Vermonters to encourage exporting of our goods and services as a path for prosperity for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. 
But trade is about more than economic statistics, it is a moral issue as well. Just as the fight to ban landmines worldwide is the right thing to do, free trade must also be fair. Fair trade expands exporting opportunities. But just as importantly, fair trade safeguards our standard of living by supporting our absolute right to a clean environment and sound labor practices. 
In earlier times workers' rights and environmental concerns were mostly separated from trade considerations, but that has begun to change. In today's global economy, the interaction between trade and the rights of workers and environmental protections cannot be ignored. One of the reasons I voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] was because it contained side agreements on labor and environmental issues--the first trade agreement to ever link these issues together. 
But, unfortunately, this fast-track authority bill moves away from the critical link between trade and labor and the environment that we fought so hard to forge in NAFTA. Under the terms of this bill, even the modest labor and environmental side agreements under NAFTA would be excluded from fast-track consideration. That is unacceptable. 
Like the NAFTA debate, the rhetoric on both sides of this debate is overblown. I do not believe the lack of fast-track authority will cripple future trade negotiations. Since fast-track authority lapsed in 1994, the administration has successfully negotiated hundreds of trade pacts with countries around the world. As the world's only superpower with a market of more than 250 million consumers, the United States will continue to command the economic power to open markets and expand export opportunities with or without the President having fast-track authority. 
I do not believe the Congress should lightly hand over its right to amend, even in the consideration of trade agreements. In no other area of legislation does Congress give up its constitutional right to offer amendments. If the Congress has no more recourse on these issues than to vote trade agreements up or down, the key question to ask is: Does this bill give the President the authority to negotiate trade agreements that protect the rights of all our citizens? It does not. 
I had hoped that when fast-track legislation reached the Senate floor it would have allowed for expanding export opportunities while protecting our workers and our environment. This bill fails to deliver those necessary protections. As a result, I will vote against it.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a Vermonter who is on active duty in the U.S. Army contacted me recently to let me know of his support for a ban on antipersonnel landmines. He wrote from personal experience, and his comments mirrored those I have received from so many other servicemen and women who have seen first-hand the danger these weapons pose to our own troops. 
Here is what he wrote: 
In the many training exercises in which I have participated, landmines were relatively ineffective in disrupting enemy attacks. Landmines often caused fratricide casualties among one's own troops. The locations of the training landmines were almost never properly recorded. The modern battlefield is simply too fluid and complex to accurately keep track of all the landmines that are emplaced. Under actual combat conditions, these landmines will represent a certain threat to the lives of U.S. personnel. 
Mr. President, compare that to a recent U.S. Army report which concluded that landmines contributed to the high rate of fratricide during recent exercises at Fort Irwin, CA. Air-dropped landmines, the so-called smart mines that the Pentagon claims pose no danger to U.S. troops or civilians, were the biggest single cause of friendly-fire deaths during mock battles. Of the 82 soldiers that were `killed' by friendly fire, 45 of them were victims of their own landmines. In one incident, an Army unit drove into its own mines dropped by aircraft, resulting in what would have been 23 deaths in a real war. 
Now compare that to our experience in Vietnam, where over 64,000 Americans were killed or injured by landmines. The vast majority of those casualties resulted from U.S. mines, or mines containing U.S. components. In other words, we made the mines and took them over there, and they ended up killing our own people. I wonder how many times history has to repeat itself before we get the message. 
A veteran of the Persian Gulf war described the same danger of fratricide. He said:  
I spoke to numerous military officers who agreed * * * that they would never employ scatterables (the air-dropped mines) in their area of operations, even if those scatterables were designed to self-destruct after a short period of time. Why? They were simply not prepared to risk the lives of their soldiers on the promise that the technology would work as designed. The fact is that U.S. ground warfare doctrine is `maneuver' warfare doctrine--highly mobile, able to take advantage of the terrain, exploit the weakness of the enemy on the battlefield. A commander who uses anti-personnel mines--except in the most exigent, Alamo-like situation--is deliberately reducing his or her battlefield advantage of speed and flexibility. 
Mr. President, despite this, the Pentagon insists that landmines protect our troops. It is the same old story. Years ago, they said we could not do without biological weapons. They said the same about chemical weapons, which they called the most effective weapon history has ever known. They said if we gave up Okinawa that we would irreparably undermine our security in the Pacific. They fought the nuclear test ban. And now they say that landmines, which have consistently plagued our own forces in battle, protect American lives. 
I respect our military leaders and I support a defense second to none. But I am losing patience with the Pentagon's arguments. They simply fly in the face of the evidence. Their latest arguments about the need for antipersonnel mines to defend antitank mines wither under close scrutiny. Unfortunately, too many people, including some in the White House, accept the Pentagon's arguments as gospel, and don't ask the hard questions. 
From my off-the-record conversations with Pentagon officials it is obvious to me that the real problem is that they do not want to give up a weapon, regardless of how marginal its utility or how dangerous it is to our own troops, because they are loath to encourage so-called arms control activists from trying to ban other weapons that endanger civilians. I understand their fear, because unlike a century ago when the overwhelming majority of war casualties were soldiers, being a soldier in a war today is far safer than being a civilian. The overwhelming majority of war casualties today are civilians. 
That is hardly a reason to stay outside of a treaty that offers the best hope for riding the world of a weapon that is both inhumane and militarily unnecessary. When the Pentagon argues that our `smart' mines do not cause the humanitarian problem, I ask them to consider that as long as we stay outside the treaty we are part of the humanitarian problem because there will never be an international ban without the United States. And I ask them to consider the evidence. Given the danger our own mines pose to our troops, we should shop using them for that reason alone.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, although I am delighted that the Senate will today be confirming James S. Gwin as a Federal district court judge, the Republican Leader has once again passed over and refused to take up the nomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest pending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, having languished on the Senate Calendar since June 12. The central district of California desperately needs this vacancy filled, which has been open for more than 18 months, and Margaret Morrow is eminently qualified to fill it. 
Just last week, the opponents of this nomination announced in a press conference that they welcomed a debate and rollcall vote on Margaret Morrow. But again the Republican majority leader has refused to bring up this well-qualified nominee for such debate and vote. It appears that Republicans have time for press conferences to attack one of the President's judicial nominations, but the majority leader will not allow the U.S. Senate to turn to that nomination for a vote. We can discuss the nomination in sequential press conferences and weekend talk show appearances but not in the one place that action must be taken on it, on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The Senate has suffered through hours of quorum calls in the past few weeks which time would have been better spent debating and voting on this judicial nomination. 
The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are puzzling--not only to those of us in the Senate who know her record but to those who know her best in California, including many Republicans. 
They cannot fathom why a few Senators have decided to target someone as well-qualified and as moderate as she is.

Mr. LEAHY. This article documents the deep and widespread bipartisan support that Margaret Morrow enjoys from Republicans that know her. In fact, these Republicans are shocked that some Senators have attacked Ms. Morrow. For example, Sheldon H. Sloan, a former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and an associate of Gov. Pete Wilson, declared that: `My party has the wrong woman in their sights.' 
Stephen S. Trott, a former high-ranking official in the Reagan administration and now a Court of Appeals judge wrote to the majority leader to try to free up the Morrow nomination, according to this article Judge Trott informed Senator Lott. 
I know that you are concerned, and properly so, about the judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench. So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means: follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes. Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a judicial position. 
Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration, observed in the article that: `Margaret has gotten tangled in a web of larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere pawn in this struggle.' I could not agree more. 
Mr. President, it is time to free the nomination of Margaret Morrow from this tangled web that some extremists are trying to weave. It is time to debate and vote on the nomination of Margaret Morrow. 
Mr. President, again, I am pleased we will take up the nomination of Judge James Gwin. But we are, once again, overlooking the nomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest pending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, and is strongly supported by both Republicans and Democrats. The Senate ought to have the courage and the honesty to either vote for her or against her.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has taken up the nomination of Judge James S. Gwin to be a U.S. district court judge for the northern district of Ohio. 
Since 1989, Judge Gwin has served as a judge for the Court of Common Pleas in Stark County, OH. Three times during his judgeship, Judge Gwin has been elected administrative judge by his peers, and in 1995, he was elected presiding judge. In addition to his legal service, Judge Gwin has volunteered for several organizations, including the North Central Ohio Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and the Central Stark County Mental Health Center. His nomination enjoys the strong bipartisan support of Senator Glenn and Senator DeWine. 
Despite his exemplary record, one or more of my colleagues on the majority has again demanded a rollcall vote on a judicial nomination. That is, of course, the right of any Senator and I do not object. Indeed, I welcome the vote. I expect this rollcall vote to be much like the last eight in which a unanimous Senate approves a well-qualified judicial nomination. I congratulate Judge Gwin and his family on this achievement and look forward to his service on the U.S. district court.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on a bill which will amend the act of incorporation of the American Legion. I have introduced this bill with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
Last year, Congress expanded the dates of the Vietnam war for purposes of veterans benefits by shifting the official start of the war from December 22, 1961, to February 28, 1961. The bill before the Senate makes a similar change in the Legion's charter. When we pass this into law the Legion will be able to extend membership to those men and women who served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces during the early years of the Vietnam war. I am hopeful that we can pass it by unanimous consent today, and have it signed into law by the President before we adjourn for the year. 
Mr. President, this modest change will mean a lot to the veterans from that period who wanted the opportunity to join the American Legion but never could. They have waited for more than 35 years to have the privilege of becoming Legionnaires. We should not make them wait one day longer. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of The Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997. This bill will ensure that Canadians and United States permanent residents are treated fairly and appropriately and that the United States and Canada's long and friendly relationship regarding immigration issues is preserved. 
We must preserve the integrity of our open border and ensure that no undue hassle, inconvenience, or burden is placed upon those who cross the United States-Canada border. Vermont and Canada share many traditions, and one that we all value is the free flow of trade and tourism. Ours is the longest open border in the world, and we should do nothing to change or endanger that relationship. On Vermont's border with Canada, commerce, tourism and other exchanges across the border are part of our way of life. A general store in Norton, VT, on the border has the separate cash registers at either end of the shop. 
The Border Improvement Act will preserve the status quo for Canadians and Americans crossing the United States' northern border. It will ensure that tourists and trade continue to be able to freely cross the border, without additional documentation requirements. This bill will also guarantee that the over $1 billion in daily cross-border trade is not hindered in any way. The Border Improvement Act takes a more thoughtful approach to modifying U.S. immigration policies than last year's bill, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act [IIRIRA]. By requiring the Attorney General to thoroughly assess the potential cost and impact before implementing any sort of automated entry-exit monitoring system on the Nation's land borders, this bill ensures that any such system will be well planned and implemented. Finally, the Border Improvement Act will ensure adequate staffing on the northern border by requiring a substantial increase in the number of INS and Customs agents assigned to this region over the next 3 years. 
I am particularly pleased to see that this bill has clear bipartisan support. Last year, I worked closely with Senator Abraham to quash another ill-conceived proposed addition to the immigration bill--the implementation of border-crossing fees. We successfully defeated the fee proposal last year, but only after much debate and negotiation. 
Unfortunately, we did not have the same opportunity to debate fully the provision in section 110 of the IIRIRA which mandates that the INS develop an automated entry and exit control system to track the arrival and departure of all aliens at all borders by next October. 
The current language in section 110 of the IIRIRA, as agreed to in last would have a significant negative impact on trade and relations between the United States and Canada. By requiring an automated system for monitoring the entry and exit of all aliens, this provision would require that the INS and Customs agents stop each vehicle or individual entering or exiting the United States at all ports of entry. Canadians, United States permanent residents and many others who are not currently required to show documentation of their status would either have to carry some form of identification or fill out paperwork at the points of entry. This sort of tracking system would be enormously costly to implement along the northern border, especially since there is no current system or infrastructure to track the departure of citizens and others leaving the United States. Section 110, as currently worded, would also lead to excessive and costly traffic delays for those living and working near the border. These delays would surely have a negative impact on the $2.4 billion in goods and services shipped annually from Vermont to Canada and would likely reduce the $120 million per year which Canadians spend in Vermont. 
This legislation has been crafted with input from the INS and representatives of the Canadian Government. By including the administration and our northern neighbor in the discussions, Senators Abraham and Kennedy have developed a remedy which is sure to be implemented smoothly. My cosponsorship of this bill reflects my ongoing concern about the negative impact the implementation of the current language in section 110 of the IIRIRA would have on the economy in my home State of Vermont, as well as in the other northern border States. While this remedy was being negotiated, I cosponsored an amendment on the floor and sent letters to Attorney General Reno and INS Commissioner Meissner requesting that a study be undertaken before any sort of automated entry-exit monitoring system be implemented. I am pleased that this bill has a similar provision. But, the Border Improvement Act goes one step further to protect our Canadian neighbors' rights to freely cross the border into the United States without facing needless traffic delays or unnecessary paperwork requirements. 
I am pleased that Senator Abraham has called a hearing tomorrow to discuss this bill and the negative impact the current law would have in so many of our States. At the hearing, we will hear the testimony of Bill Stenger, the president of the Jay Peak Ski Resort in Vermont which is situated only a few miles from the Canadian border. Mr. Stenger will testify to the disastrous effect any increased documentation requirements for Canadians would have on his business, and so many other United States businesses which are dependent on the preservation of free trade and travel across the Canadian border.

Mr. LEAHY. 
Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to enact a strong and effective federal law to protect the privacy of medical records. 
To address this need, today, Senator Kennedy and I are introducing the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act (MIPSA). 
Americans strongly believe that their personal, private medical records should be kept private. The time-honored ethics of the medical profession also reflect this principle. The physicians' oath of Hippocrates requires that medical information be kept `as sacred as secrets.' 
A guiding principle in drafting this legislation is that the movement to more a integrated system of health care in our country will only continue to be supported by the American people if they are assured that the personal privacy of their health care information is protected. In fact, without the confidence that one's personal privacy will be protected, many will be discouraged from seeking medical help. 
I am encouraged that a variety of public policy and health professional organizations, across the political spectrum, are signaling their intentions to step forward to join forces with consumers during this debate. 
For the American public, and for the Congress, this debate boils down to a fundamental question: Who controls our medical records, and how freely can others use them? 
Many of us in this chamber quickly criticized the Social Security Administration and the IRS regarding the security of computer records. We blasted the IRS for allowing employees to randomly scan through our personal financial records. 
If we are concerned about IRS employees looking at our tax records, should we not be concerned about the millions of employers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and others who have nearly unfettered access to the personal medical records of more than 250 million Americans? 
All of us are health care consumers--every individual and every American family. As Congress works toward answering this question, the privacy interests of the American public will be at odds with powerful economic interests and with the penchant for large organizations and complex systems to control this kind of personal information. Well-funded and sharply focused special interests often win in a match-up like this. 
Senator Bob Dole, the former majority leader of the Senate, put his finger on this problem when he observed that a `compromise of privacy' that sends information about health and treatment to a national data bank without a person's approval would be something that none of us would accept. 
Unfortunately, this nightmare that Senator Dole envisioned is being brought to life by provisions insisted upon by the House in last year's health insurance portability bill that require a system of health care information exchanges by computers and through computer clearinghouses and data networks. 
We are now confronted with the fact that the computerization of health care record provisions are going into effect in the next few months but we are still contemplating the delay of promulgating privacy protection until August of 1999, unless Congress acts sooner. 
The Information Age opens the door to endless new possibilities and has empowered individuals with marvelous new tools and freedoms. But technology is our servant; we should not let it become our master. Unless we are vigilant, the Information Age can overwhelm our privacy rights before we even know it has happened. 
I do not want advancing technology to lead to a loss of personal privacy and do not want the fear that confidentiality is being compromised to deter people from seeking medical treatment or stifle technological or scientific development. 
The outlines of the challenge we face in stemming the erosion of medical privacy are already clear. Insurance companies have set up their Medical Information Bureau (MIB) which stores personal medical information on millions of Americans. M.I.B. may have personal information on all of us in Congress and our families. 
Managed care companies, HMOs, drug companies, and hospitals are spending up to $15 billion a year on information technology to acquire and exchange vast amounts of medical information about Americans. 
While this in and of itself may not be the issue--the question is how and why is it being collected and for what specific use is this information being used and do individuals know about this? Patients should be advised about the existence of data bases in which medical information concerning the patients is stored. 
This information can be very useful for quality assurance, and to provide more cost effective health care. But I am not certain that the American public would agree with a recent Fortune magazine article which lauded a health insurer that poked through the individual medical records of clients to figure out who may be depressed and could benefit from the use of the anti-depressant Prozac. Are we now encouraging replacing sound clinical judgment of doctors with health insurance clerks who look at records to determine whether you are not really suffering from a physical illness, but a mental illness? 
Contrary to some, I believe that computerization can assure more privacy to individuals than the current system if my legislation is enacted. But if we do not act the increased potential for embarrassment and harassment is tremendous. 
There are many more stories which highlight the problems that are out there due with the lack of privacy and security of individuals medical records, unfortunately so many other breaches of privacy are more subtle. 
Singer Tammy Wynette entered the hospital in 1995 for a bile duct problem. She used a pseudonym, but a hospital staff member broke into her computerized medical records and sold the information to the press, supposedly for thousands of dollars. The sensational National Enquirer then erroneously reported that Wynette was near death and in need of a liver transplant. 
A current Member of Congress had her medical records faxed to the New York Post on the eve of her primary. In 1994, she offered eloquent testimony before Congress detailing her ordeal. 
In another example, an insurance agent advised a couple that they would be denied coverage for any more pregnancies since they had a 25 percent chance that their children would have a fatal disease. 
In Florida, a state public health worker improperly brought home a computer disk with the names of 4,000 HIV positive patients. The disks were then sent to two Florida newspapers. 
Medical privacy issues in today's world also take on international implications. Canada and the nations of Europe are taking concrete steps to protect the confidentiality of computerized medical records. 
Our nation lags so far behind others in its protection of medical records that companies in Europe may not be allowed to send medical information to the United States electronically. European countries--through an EU privacy directive--are ensuring that private medical records are kept private. The EU prohibits the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. if the EU finds U.S. privacy law inadequate. The implications for U.S. trade are staggering. 
The legislation we are introducing today addresses the issues I have outlined to close the existing gaps in federal privacy law to cover personally identifiable health information. 
MIPSA is broad in scope--it applies to medical records in whatever form--paper or electronic. It applies to each release of medical information--including re-releases. It comprehensively covers entities other than just health care providers and payers, such as life insurance companies, employers and marketers and others that may have access to sensitive personal health data. 
It establishes a clear and enforceable right of privacy with respect all personally identifiable medical information including information regarding the results of genetic tests. 
It gives individuals the right to inspect, copy and supplement their protected health information. Today, only 28 states grant this right. 
It allows individuals to segregate portions of their medical records, such as mental health records, from broad viewing by individuals who are not directly involved in their care. 
It gives individuals a civil right of action against anyone who misuses their personally identifiable health information. It establishes criminal and civil penalties that can be invoked if individually identifiable health information is knowingly or negligently misused. 
It sets up a national office of health information privacy to aid consumers in learning about their rights and how they may seek recourse for violations of their rights. 
It creates a set of rules and norms to govern the disclosure of personal health information and narrows the sharing of personal details within the health care system to the minimum necessary to provide care, allow for payment and to facilitate effective oversight. Special attention is paid to situations such as emergency medical care and public health requirements. 
We have tried to accommodate legitimate oversight concerns so that we do not create unnecessary impediments to health care fraud investigations. Effective health care oversight is essential if our health care system is to function and fulfill its intended goals. Otherwise, we risk establishing a publicly-sanctioned playground for the unscrupulous. Health care is too important a public investment to be the subject of undetected fraud or abuse. 
MIPSA also extends to all research facilities using personally identifiable information the current requirements met by federally funded researchers. I am troubled that research is viewed by some as an area where privacy rights should be sacrificed and consent not required for use of individually identifiable health information. If there are to be any exceptions in a federal medical privacy law for research using personally identifiable health information, the Congress and the American people need to understand better why this may be necessary. To address this concern our bill mandates an evaluation of the waiver of informed consent that is allowed under current regulations. 
It does not preempt state laws that are more protective of privacy. This is consistent with all other federal civil rights and privacy laws. 
It prohibits law enforcement agents from searching through medical records without a warrant. It does not limit law enforcement agents to gain information while in hot pursuit of a suspect. 
I know that these are important matters about which many of us feel very strongly. It is never easy to legislate about privacy. 
I invite other Members of Congress, federal agencies and outside interest groups to examine the legislation we have introduced today. This bill is a work in progress and we welcome any comments or suggestions to make improvements to this legislation. 
I am pleased that my colleague from Vermont, the Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords, has already held two hearings this year on the issue of medical privacy. The clock, however, is ticking and other Members of Congress need to join us to move forward to pass strong and workable medical privacy legislation. 
As policy makers, we must remember that the right to privacy is one of our most cherished freedoms--it is the right to be left alone and to choose what we will reveal of ourselves and what we will keep from others. Privacy is not a partisan issue and should not be made a political issue. It is too important.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about an announcement the administration is making today to increase funding for humanitarian demining programs and appoint a demining czar. This is, of course, on the subject of landmines, which has been a concern of mine for many years. I have not received all the details, but I understand the administration plans to spend $80 million on humanitarian demining programs next year, which is a significant increase over the current level. 
They also plan to seek additional support from other governments, corporations, and foundations. Their goal is to raise $1 billion to clear most of the world's landmines by the year 2010. I also understand Ambassador Karl Inderfurth, our Assistant Secretary for South Asia and formerly the U.S. Alternate Representative to the United Nations, is to become the new demining czar. 
I can think of no better person to lead this effort than Ambassador Inderfurth. The Ambassador, known as Rick to his friends, is a long-time friend of mine. I have immense respect and admiration for him. I have watched him prowl the halls of the United Nations and buttonhole other representatives, as did Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when she was our U.N. Representative, to get support for an international ban on antipersonnel landmines. 
Rick has been a passionate voice for the victims of landmines. I am very grateful that he has agreed to take this on, especially as he already has a full-time job that would be more than enough for most people. He will do a superb job. 
This announcement is being made today by Secretaries Albright and Cohen. I commend them both, and I say that it is welcome news. 
While its goals sound awfully ambitious, some may say even unrealistic, time will tell. They have my full support. 
This is an area in which not nearly enough has been done, and the United States has a great deal to offer. 
Mr. President, today we clear landmines much the same way that we did in World War II or Korea. It takes an enormous amount of time and it is extremely dangerous. There is very little money, especially as most of these landmines are in the Third World. 
Our leadership in this area could help immeasurably. Look what we did after World War II with the tens of millions of landmines spread all over Europe. We cleared most of them in a decade. There are still parts of Europe that have landmines today, but most of them are gone. 
The administration's plan builds on what the Congress began some years ago. We established humanitarian demining programs at both the Departments of Defense and State. At the beginning, the Pentagon did not want to do it. They said it was not their mission. They said their job was breaching mine fields, not clearing mines. That is one reason there are so many unexploded landmines killing and maiming innocent people around the world. 
What happens, of course, Mr. President, is that the world's militaries leave millions of landmines behind once the wars end, the soldiers go home, the guns are unloaded, the leaders sign the peace agreements, and hands are shaken. 
But the landmines stay, and some unsuspecting child or farmer steps on them--a child going to school or someone going to gather water or firewood. Someone trying to raise crops to feed their family. Or an unsuspecting missionary. 
There are so many victims, long after anybody even remembers who was fighting whom, or why. There are Russian mines, American mines, Italian mines and mines from other countries in hundreds of varieties in over 68 countries. It is estimated that it would cost, at the rate we are going now, billions of dollars over decades and decades to get rid of them. 
Over time, the Pentagon has become more supportive. I hope this new initiative means that they are now fully on board. They have the expertise and technology to make an important contribution. They could cut years, years off the time it would take to demine the world. 
Again, as I have said, we are using the same demining technologies that were common years ago. We are not taking advantage of some of the technology and expertise available today. And the demining programs that we now use have been in place for several years have a mixed record. The administration says they have spent some $150 million to date. I wonder how many landmines have been removed for all that money? I suspect if anyone did the arithmetic it would come to hundreds of dollars, possibly even thousands of dollars, to remove each landmine. Of course, the tragic irony of that is that it only costs $3 or $4 to put the landmine in the ground in the first place. 
So I suggest, in building on what Secretary Albright and Secretary Cohen said today, that we begin with a top-to-bottom review of our demining efforts. They are too uncoordinated among government agencies. This should include a thorough review of the program that is in the Pentagon itself. 
The Pentagon should play a central role, but I am concerned that some Pentagon officials have been more interested in using this program to make contacts with foreign military personnel than to build the sustainable demining capabilities in these other countries. The soldiers we send to do the training in places like Eritrea and Mozambique and other mine-infested countries are among our best, and they do a terrific job. There is no one more proud of them than I am. But we need to be sure that when they leave, the people they have trained have the knowledge and the equipment and the support to carry on. 
We have the Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program. This program funds research and development on new demining technologies. This program, again, established by the Congress three years ago, has the potential to revolutionize the way we detect and destroy landmines and other unexploded ordnance. 
This may be what enables us to make that quantum leap forward so that instead of taking decades and decades to get rid of the mines, we cut that time substantially. The Pentagon also has a lot to offer in this area, but it has not been fully supportive of it despite the best efforts of the people involved. As one who has spent nearly 10 years working to ban anti-personnel landmines, to support programs to clear mines and care for the victims, I must say that there should be some thought given to moving this program elsewhere or reorganizing it, because there needs to be much more coordination with the private sector and with other governments that are also working in this area. 
Mr. President, there is another part of this that needs to be mentioned. Two years ago, the President of the United States went to the United Nations to urge the world's nations to negotiate a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. 
In December, over 110 governments will sign such a treaty in Ottawa. But the United States is not going to be among them. In fact, not only will we be absent, now we find the Pentagon is backtracking on the pledge it made a year ago to find alternatives to anti-personnel landmines. 
So taken in this context, it is no surprise that the administration feels it must do something to counter the growing impression around the world that the United States has become an obstacle to an international ban. 
Thirteen members of NATO and most of the world's producers and users and exporters of landmines will sign the treaty in Ottawa, but not the world's only superpower. We have taken the position that even though we are the most powerful nation history has ever known, we cannot give up our landmines but we want everybody else to give up theirs. Rather than lead this effort, we risk being left behind with a handful of pariah states with whom we do not belong. We are too great a nation for that. 
No one should suggest that a ban is a substitute for demining. There are some 100 million unexploded landmines in the ground, and whether there is a ban or not they will go on maiming and killing until we get rid of them. We have to do that. But neither is demining a substitute for a ban. Why spend billions of dollars to get rid of the mines if they are simply replaced with new mines? 
We need to destroy the mines that are in the ground. We need to stop the laying of new mines. Both are necessary to rid the world of these insidious weapons. 
So I welcome this initiative. I will do everything I can to support it. But let us not fool themselves. The United States is about to miss a historic opportunity. We should sign the Ottawa treaty, just as we should do everything we can to lead an international demining effort to get rid of the mines in the ground.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let us hope that the Pentagon's pledge today to help lead an international demining effort is a lot longer lasting. 
Mr. President, I have spoken on this subject so many times. I think of when I went to Oslo recently when governments were meeting there to talk about an international ban. And I was joined by Tim Rieser, of my staff, who has worked so hard on this, and David Carle. I met with the American negotiators who were there and had a chance to speak to the delegates and the NGO's and others who had gathered. 
And I said: I dream of a world, as we go into the next century, a world where armies of humanity dig up and destroy the landmines that are in the ground and when no other armies come and put new landmines down. 
If we did that, Mr. President, if the world did that, removed the landmines that are there, banned the use of new landmines, we would give such great hope to people everywhere. 
Today, there are countries where families literally have to tether their child on a rope near where they live because they know within the circle of that rope is one of the few areas that is free of landmines. And the child can play only on the end of a leash like a dog. 
These are the same places where people often go hungry. They cannot work in their fields without risking their lives. And they often have no choice. And when one of them loses a limb, or his or her life, the whole family suffers. That is the reality for millions of people, and that is why this demining initiative is so important. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Seeing nobody else seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken many times on the floor about the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Mr. Lee testified before the Judiciary Committee. It was really the culmination of the American dream. A son of Chinese immigrants who went from living at the family laundry upon his father returning from World War II and then on to achieving one of the highest academic records ever, and ends up dedicating his life to protecting the civil rights of all Americans. At a time when we are discussing what is happening regarding the lack of civil rights in the country of his forbears--what a marked contrast. 
I am concerned when I hear some Members trying to stall or defeat his nomination. They have done it by mischaracterizing Mr. Lee and his record of practical problem solving. 
Yesterday, my statement pointed out that the confirmation of this son of Chinese immigrants to be the principal Federal law enforcement official responsible for protecting the civil rights of all Americans would stand in sharp contrast to the human rights practices in China. 
Some are obviously trying to stall or defeat this nomination by mischaracterizing Mr. Lee and his record of practical problem solving. Bill Lee testified that he regards quotas as illegal and wrong, but some would ignore his real record of achievement and our hearing if allowed to do so. I am confident that the vast majority of the Senate and the American people will see through the partisan rhetoric and support Bill Lee. 
Bill Lee has dedicated his career to wide ranging work on civil rights issues. He has represented poor children who were being denied lead screening tests, women and people of color who were denied job opportunities and promotions, neighbors in a mixed income and mixed race community who strove to save their homes, and parents seeking a good education for their children. Mr. Lee has developed a broad array of supporters over the years, including the Republican mayor of Los Angeles, former opposing counsels, and numerous others who cross race, gender and political affiliation lines. 
Senator D'Amato spoke eloquently of Mr. Lee's qualifications and background while introducing him last week. Senator Warner wrote to the White House in support of Mr. Lee's candidacy. Senators Moynihan, Inouye, Akaka, Feinstein, and Boxer supported Mr. Lee at his confirmation hearing last week and Representatives Mink, Beccera, Matsui, and Jackson-Lee all took the time to come to the hearings to show their commitment to this outstanding nominee. 
To those who know him, Bill Lee is a person of integrity who is well known for resolving complex cases. He has been involved in approximately 200 cases in his 23 years of law practice, and he has settled all but 6 of them. Clearly, this is strong evidence that Mr. Lee is a problem solver and practical in his approach to the law. No one who has taken the time to thoroughly review his record could call him an idealogue.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that we are soon going to vote on the nomination of Charles J. Siragusa to be a judge of the U.S. district court for the Western District of New York. 
The judge has the highest rating possible from the ABA. He was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee. He was a prosecutor. I commend him and the others. 
This morning the majority leader has decided to call up the nomination of Charles Siragusa to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. I expect this rollcall vote to be much like the last seven in which a unanimous Senate approves a well-qualified judicial nomination. 
As I stated, Judge Siragusa received the highest rating possible from the ABA. He was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee along with others who remain on the Senate calendar awaiting action. He is supported by Senators Moynihan and D'Amato. 
Judge Siragusa served as an assistant district attorney for the Monroe County district attorney's office in Rochester, NY, for 15 years from 1977 to 1992 and is currently a judge on the New York State Supreme Court. He has been the recipient of numerous legal awards, including the 1996 Recognition Award from the Monroe County Magistrates Association. He has served as a volunteer member of the Families and Friends of Murdered Children and Victims of Violence advisory board since 1995. 
I congratulate Judge Siragusa, his wife and family on this day and look forward to his service on the U.S. district court. 
But I would also note, we had time set aside for debate on this. And we continue to have judges who are held up silently, and then we cannot vote on them. 
Margaret Morrow of California is an example of this. We have spent far more time on quorum calls this year than we have on any debate of Margaret Morrow, except that we find Senators who have press conferences saying that she should not be confirmed or could not be confirmed or will not be confirmed--but nobody wants to bring her nomination to a vote. 
She, like the judge we will soon confirm, is an extraordinarily well-qualified nominee. She does have one difference. She is a woman. And I do not know why this woman, who has been the president of the California Bar Association, one of the most prestigious positions any lawyer has ever received, as well as the L.A. bar, why this woman is continuously blocked. 
Frankly, I could find no other reason than her gender. And I think it is shocking. I think it is a shame. 
While I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with the confirmation of a judicial nominee, there remains no excuse for the Senate's delay with respect the more than 50 other judicial nominations sent by the President. The Senate should me moving more promptly to fill the vacancies plaguing the federal courts. Twenty-three confirmations in a year in which we have witnessed 115 vacancies is not fulfilling the Senate's constitutional responsibility. 
At the end of Senator Hatch's first year chairing the Committee, 1995, the Senate adjourned having confirmed 58 judicial nominations and leaving only 49 vacancies. This year the Senate has confirmed less than half of the number confirmed in 1995 but will adjourn leaving almost twice as many judgeships vacant. 
At the snail's pace that the Senate is proceeding with judicial nominations this year, we are not even keeping up with attrition. When Congress adjourned last year, there were 64 vacancies on the Federal bench. In the last 10 months, another 50 vacancies have occurred. Thus, after the confirmation of 23 judges in 10 months, there has been a net increase of 28 vacancies, an increase of almost 50 percent in the number of current Federal judicial vacancies. 
Judicial vacancies have been increasing, not decreasing, over the course of this year and therein lies the vacancy crisis. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the Federal judiciary.' 
I have commended Senator Hatch for scheduling 2 days of confirmation hearings for judicial nominees this week. Unfortunately, that brought to only eight the total number of confirmation hearings for judicial nominees held all year, not even one a month. 
The Judiciary Committee still has pending before it over 30 nominees in need of a hearing from among the 73 nominations sent to the Senate by the President during this Congress. From the first day of this session of Congress, this committee has never had pending before it fewer than 20 judicial nominees for hearings. The committee's backlog had doubled to more than 40. 
There is no excuse for the Judiciary Committee's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably reported last year. Judge Paez had a hearing last year but has been passed over so far this year. Professor Fletcher, Judge Paez and Ms. McKeown are all nominees for judicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, as well. 
The committee still has pending before it 10 nominees who were first nominated during the last Congress, including five who have been pending since 1995. Thus, while I am delighted that we are moving more promptly with respect to certain nominees, I remain concerned about all vacancies and all nominees. 
Since no regular executive business Meeting of the Judiciary Committee was held this week and none has yet been noticed for next week, which may be our last before adjournment, the committee may not have an opportunity to report any of the 13 fine judicial nominees who participated in hearings this week or the nominations of Clarence Sundram or Judge Sonia Sotomayor or, for that matter, the nomination of Bill Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. 
I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of these fine women and men to reconsider and to work with us to have the committee and the Senate fulfill its constitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are growing more critical by the day. 
A good example of the continuing stall is the long-pending nomination of Margaret Morrow. The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are puzzling--not only to those of us in the Senate who know her record but to those who know her best in California, including many Republicans. They cannot fathom why a few Senators have decided to target someone as well-qualified and as moderate as she is. 
Anthony Lewis asked the question in a column in The New York Times earlier this week: `Why [are some] trying to frighten conservatives with talk of nonexistent liberal activist Clinton judges?' Those who start a witch hunt, want to find a witch--even if they have to contort the facts and destroy a good person in the process. That seems to be what is going on with this nomination as opponents of this administration are seeking to construct a straw woman in the place of the real Margaret Morrow. She does not subscribe to an activist judicial philosophy and I am confident that as a district court judge would apply the law consistent with precedents established by the U.S. Supreme Court, the court of appeals and judicial precedent. 
With respect to the issue of judicial activism, we have the nominee's views. She told the committee: `The specific role of a trial judge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and courts of appeals. His or her role is not to `make law.' She also noted:  
Given the restrictions of the case and controversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems facing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job of the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional structure. 
Margaret Morrow was the first woman president of the California Bar Association and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is currently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. She is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and by Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration. Representative James Rogan attended her second confirmation hearing to endorse her. 
Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good works should not be punished. Her public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve this treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away from Government service. 
The president of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the president of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: `Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties.' She `is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.' I could not agree more. 
This nomination has been pending since May 9, 1996. No one can blame President Clinton for the delay in filling this important judgeship. Within 4 months of Judge Gadbois' disability, the President had sent Margaret Morrow's name to the Senate. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown and was not called up for Senate consideration during the rest of that year. 
She was renominated on January 7, 1997, the first day of this session of Congress. She had her second confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the judiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When she was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported with the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for more than 4 months and been passed over, again and again. 
Senator Hatch noted in a Senate floor statement on September 29 that he continues to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that he will vote for her. He said:  
I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on her behalf. 
Yesterday Senators Ashcroft and Sessions held a press conference in which they noted their opposition to this nomination. I am glad that the secret holds that had prevented the consideration of this nomination are now over and urge the majority leader to proceed to call up this nomination for a debate and vote without further delay. This is the U.S. Senate, once the greatest deliberative body in the world and the conscience of the Nation. We should proceed to debate this nomination and vote. 
Every Senator is free to vote for or against a nominee. What I have not appreciated is the mysterious hold over nominations for months at a time. Now that the sources of the hold have come forward, the Senate should proceed to debate and vote. 
I do not oppose a recorded vote on Margaret Morrow any more than I opposed a recorded vote on Frank J. Siragusa, or Algenon Marbley, or Katherine Sweeney Hayden, or Janet C. Hall, or Christopher Droney, or Joseph F. Bataillon, or Frank M. Hull, or Henry Harold Kennedy, Jr., or Merrick B. Garland. In fact, on the last seven roll call votes on judicial nominees preceded that this morning, there has been a cumulative total of one negative vote by a single Senator on one of those seven nominees. Six judges were confirmed by unanimous roll call votes and one was confirmed 98 to one. 
Meanwhile, while the Senate fiddles, the people served by the District Court for the Central District of California continue to suffer the effects of this persistent vacancy, one of the dozens of judicial emergency vacancies being perpetuated around the country. This nomination has been held up so long that the vacancy has now extended to more than 18 months and is designated a judicial emergency vacancy by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. 
This is a district court with over 300 cases that have been pending for longer than three years and in which the time for disposing of criminal felony cases and the number of cases filed increased over the last year. Judges in this district handle approximately 400 cases a year, including somewhere between 40 and 50 criminal felony cases. Still this judicial vacancy is being perpetuated by the refusal to vote on this well-qualified nominee. 
I fear that the nomination of Margaret Morrow has become a fund raising ploy for the extreme right wing. This past weekend we learned that a $1.4 million fund raising and lobbying effort is underway to try to perpetuate the judicial vacancy crisis and continue the partisan and ideological stall on Senate consideration of much-needed judges. 
I understand that big donors are solicited with promises of intimate dinners with leading conservative elected and public figures closely involved with the judicial confirmation process and that Senators appear on a videotape being used as an integral part of this opposition effort. 
Those pressing this effort complain about what they see as the failure of the U.S. Senate to block the appointment of judges to the Federal bench. The American people, litigants, prosecutors, and judges have just the opposite complaint--that the perpetuation of judicial vacancies is affecting the administration of justice and rendering our laws empty promises. 
It is sad that this effort is premised on the slanted portrayal of decisions, many of which were decided by judges appointed by Republican Presidents. I have spoken before about the dangers of characterizing isolated decisions to stir up anger against the judiciary. Short-term monetary or political gain is not worth the price. 
This fund raising campaign seems to extend back over the course of the year but has only become public with reports in the Los Angeles Times and New York Times over last weekend. Those who delight in taking credit for having killed, judicial nominees last year continue their misguided efforts to the detriment of effective law enforcement and civil justice. This extreme right-wing fund raising campaign to kill qualified judicial nominations is wrong. 
Targeting such a well-qualified nominee as Margaret Morrow is an example of just how wrong this scheme is. I believe all would agree that it is time for the full Senate to debate this nomination and vote on it. I understand that Senator Ashcroft welcomed such a debate at his press conference yesterday. I have looked forward to that debate for some time. I ask again, as I have done repeatedly over the last several months, why not now, why not today, why not this week? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this has been an extraordinary week in Washington with the first State visit by the Chinese leadership since 1989. While President Jiang Zemin's visit has resulted in important agreements on economic, environmental and security issues between our two nations, it has not resulted in the hoped for progress on human rights issues in China. 
Yesterday, I spoke about Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan scholar and documentary filmmaker who was a Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont. In 1995 he had gone to Tibet to document traditional Tibetan music and dance when he was detained by Chinese authorities and then sentenced to 18 years in prison for allegedly spying on behalf of the Dalai Lama. No evidence to support these claims has ever been produced, despite my persistent inquiries. Nor have the Chinese authorities provided any information about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts or health status over the past two years. I have raised these concerns with President Jiang directly, emphasizing to him that Mr. Choephel's release from prison would be a meaningful step in the right direction on human rights issues. Yesterday and today in meetings with the Chinese President, I raised this human rights issue, again. 
The gulf between our two countries can most clearly be seen on the issue of human rights. This week demonstrates the distance between our two countries in another way as the Senate considers President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice. When confirmed, Bill Lee will be the principal law enforcement officer of the Federal Government to ensure the civil rights and equal treatment of all Americans. He will also be the first Asian-American to hold this post and exercise such authority. 
A meaningful step the Senate should take without delay is to confirm Bill Lee, a Chinese-American whose life story and life's work are quintessentially American. At the same time we are urging the Chinese Government to improve their human rights' record, we should demonstrate through action and not just words our own commitment to human rights and civil rights by proceeding without further delay on this important nomination. 
Mr. Lee was born in Harlem to Chinese immigrant parents. His parents ran a laundry in New York. He went on to graduate from Yale College magna cum laude and then Columbia Law School. He testified last week that his childhood experiences, which included hearing racial slurs directed at his parents and his father's inability to rent an apartment after returning from volunteering for military service in World War II, greatly influenced his decision to dedicate his life to civil rights work. Mr. Lee's efforts over the years have ensured Americans of all races and creeds opportunities to advance in their careers, remain in their homes and raise healthy children. 
Since July, Senator Kennedy and I repeatedly urged the committee to hold a hearing on Mr. Lee's nomination before the Columbus Day recess in order to give this important nomination an opportunity to be considered by the Senate this year. Unfortunately that hearing only took place last week. Chairman Hatch has consistently indicated his commitment to getting this nomination considered before adjournment. 
At the hearing, Mr. Lee answered hours of questions. The Republican members of the committee and the majority leader also submitted pages of written questions to him, which have also been answered. All members of the committee have met or had the opportunity to meet with the nominee personally. Unfortunately there was no business meeting of the Judiciary Committee this week. I have asked the chairman to report this nomination to the Senate without delay and hope that he will do so. 
Bill Lee is a nominee who has impressed everyone with whom he has met. He is a man of integrity who has practiced mainstream civil rights law for 23 years. He is a practical problem solver, as attested to in tributes from opposing counsel and people from both political parties. 
Chairman Hatch has clearly indicated that he views Bill Lee as imminently qualified for the Assistant Attorney General position at Department of Justice. At Mr. Lee's nomination hearing last Wednesday, Senator Hatch referred to Bill Lee's `long and distinguished career' and noted his `commitment to improving the lives of many Americans who have felt the sting of invidious discrimination.' These comments are encouraging. 
Senator Hatch has been stalwart in moving a number of top Justice Department nominees through the committee promptly. As examples, I point to the nomination of Eric Holder to be the Deputy Attorney General, Ray Fisher to be the Associate Attorney General, and Joel Klein to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. 
In connection with the confirmation of Assistant Attorney General Klein, Senator Hatch said: 
`I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold a nominee hostage because of such concerns, especially one as competent and decent as Joel Klein. In my view, sound public policy is best served by bringing this nominee up for a vote, permitting the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed chief of the Antitrust Division, and for us in Congress to move forward and work with the Department and other involved agencies in the formulation and implementation of telecommunications policies.' 
`There are times when I disagree with the President, but I have to say when he does a good job and when he does nominate good people . . . then I will support the President. 
`I will do what I can to show support for him and to encourage him to continue to pick the highest quality people for these positions.' 
Adhering to that policy should lead us to a prompt and favorable vote on Mr. Lee. 
At the recent nomination hearing of Ray Fisher, Senator Hatch assured the administration that `nominees for the Department of Justice will continue to receive thorough and prompt consideration by the committee.' I am hopeful that Senator Hatch will apply this same standard to Mr. Lee's nomination. 
I look forward to the vote on Bill Lee, a stellar nominee to head the Office of Civil Rights at Department of Justice. Mr. Lee's recent decision to recuse himself from any involvement in the Proposition 209 case further reflects his integrity and forthrightness on these sorts of matters. 
Bill Lee's story is a true American saga. Raised by immigrants, in one generation he has risen to the top of his profession and is now being considered to head the Nation's civil rights division. Let us make sure the story ends the way it should--with the confirmation of Mr. Lee as Assistant Attorney General before we adjourn this session.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have strongly objected to the proposed Federal Communications Commission rules that I believe essentially rob States and communities of the authority to decide where unsightly telecommunications towers should be built, and I want to renew my objection to those proposed rules. 
Back when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed, there were only five Senators who voted against it. I was one of the five. One of my fears was that the will and voices of States and of local communities would be muzzled. 
As a lifelong Vermonter, I didn't want to see that happen to my State. Unfortunately, the fears I had at that time have been confirmed. Under the so-called telecommunications reform bill, Vermont towns and towns in other States have very little say when big and unsightly towers are proposed. Towns can no longer just say, `No, you can't put that awful tower in our community, blocking our scenic vistas.' It is unfortunate that 91 Senators said they were willing to see the rights of towns and cities trampled that way. 
The bill also prohibits towns and cities from having stricter health and safety standards regarding environmental effects of radio frequency emissions. 
Here is what has happened in Vermont. Keep in mind, Mr. President, that our State is one of the most beautiful States in the country. People come to our State because of the magnificent views. And those of us who were born there want to remain there because of this beauty. Now we are being told that no matter how much we have done to promote this beauty, if somebody wants to just slap up telecommunication towers right in the middle of the most magnificent vista there may be little we can do about it. 
The State of Vermont, from Gov. Howard Dean to the Vermont Environmental Board and local zoning officials and mayors and citizens, is concerned that it is losing control of the siting and design and construction of telecommunication towers and related facilities. 
These people have written to the FCC opposing this rule, and I endorse their comments. They have done an excellent job representing the views of all Vermonters. As a matter of fact, I also submitted a lengthy petition, something I rarely do but I did this as a Vermonter hoping that we will influence the FCC. 
I think these tower siting rules should be stopped once and for all. We ought to tear them out by their roots which were planted in the 1996 telecommunications bill. 
To make sure that they can be torn out, I am introducing legislation that repeals the authority given to the FCC in 1996 to preempt State and local regulations on the placement of new telecommunication towers. I don't want Vermont turned into a giant pin cushion with 200-foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain and in every valley, ruining the view that most of us have spent a lifetime enjoying. 
I might note that my distinguished colleague from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, is going to join me as a cosponsor of this legislation 
The backbone of Vermont's beauty is its great mountains, surrounded by magnificent views of valleys, rivers, and streams. Vermonters do not want these scenic vistas destroyed by towers, bristling with all manner of antennas and bright lights, strobes, flashes, and everything else that destroy this vista. 
I think of my own home, my tree farm in Middlesex, VT. When I step out the front door of my home, I look 35 miles down a valley ringed by mountains. I live on a dirt road, and I literally cannot see another house or another dwelling in any direction. I look at some of the most beautiful scenery of Vermont. Frankly, Mr. President, each time I am back home this renews my soul and my spirit. 
I am sure all Vermonters and all those who visit us in Vermont feel the same way I do about the scenic wonders of our State. Because of that, we Vermonters have determined that we want to move with care to avoid the indiscriminate placement of towers that would jeopardize one of our State's most precious assets. We Vermonters want some say in our own life. We Vermonters want some say in protecting what is the best in our beautiful State. 
Vermont citizens and communities should be able to participate in the important decisions that affect their families and their future. The location of large transmission towers have significant effects on property values, on health, and enjoyment of one's home, in fact even the ability to sell one's home. 
I say the Telecommunications Act went far too far toward preemption of local control and now this proposed FCC implementation goes even further. Vermont has enacted landmark legislation, Act 250, to preserve our environment while permitting growth. 
Understand, when I sit in my home in Vermont, I am connected by computer to my office in Washington and my offices in two other locations in Vermont. I can communicate with my children wherever they are by telephone or by computer. I pull up newspapers that are not available to me immediately in Vermont off the Internet. I am for progress. I think that is something Vermont has always supported, but not for ill-considered, so-called progress at the expense of Vermont families and homeowners. 
It is important that Vermont not be left out of technological progress, but that is the whole reason Vermont enacted the Act 250 process. Vermont communities and the State of Vermont have to have a role in deciding where these towers are going to go. Vermonters should be able to take into account the protection of our scenic beauty. It is not enough just to have technological advances. 
So by requiring the companies to work with Vermont towns, acceptable alternatives can be found. My bill, again, affirms where the burden of proof should be: with the applicant, not the community. I trust Vermonters to do what is right to protect our State's beautiful scenery. All I am saying, Mr. President, is let Vermonters decide what to do with our scenery. The FCC rules should not stand.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in March, the House passed H.R. 672. On April 17, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported our companion bill, S. 506. 
The only substantive difference between the two bills is that S. 506 provides that the reasonable costs of a ratemaking proceeding conducted by a copyright arbitration royalty panel will be split 50-50 between the parties who would receive royalties from the royalty rate adopted in the proceeding and the parties who would pay the royalty rate so adopted. H.R. 672 provides that the costs shall be borne by the parties in direct proportion to their share of the distribution. The Copyright Office believes that the House version provides the copyright arbitration royalty panels with greater flexibility in certain circumstances. It is for this reason that the Senate is taking up the House version of the bill. 
Last year, when the House considered and passed a similar bill, H.R. 1861, it included another section clarifying that the distribution of phonorecords prior to 1978 did not constitute action divesting copyright for the musical composition. This section was intended to clarify the Copyright Law of 1909 on an issue that has become a matter of increasing litigation in a number of Federal Circuits since the Ninth Circuit decision in the ZZ Top case. I was disappointed last year that the Senate did not proceed to consider and pass that bill. 
We now have that opportunity. The amendment to H.R. 672 adds back into the bill clarifications, which Chairman Hatch and I have cosponsored as part of another measure this year. This improvement will clarify an esoteric but increasingly important point of copyright law under the 1909 Act with respect to copyrights of musical compositions created more than 20 years ago. 
I therefore urge the adoption of the amendment to H.R. 672 and the immediate passage of the bill.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret that I must again bring to the Senate's attention the situation of imprisoned Tibetan music and dance scholar, Ngawang Choephel. I had hoped that Chinese authorities would have recognized by now the grave mistake they made in sentencing him to 18 years in prison. 
In 1995, Mr. Choephel was in Tibet making a documentary film of traditional Tibetan music and dance when he was detained by Chinese authorities. After being held incommunicado for 15 months without access to his family or independent legal counsel, Mr. Choephel was sentenced to 18 years in prison for violating the State Security Law. It was insinuated that he was paid by the U.S. Government to spy on behalf of the Dalai Lama. No evidence to support such a claim has ever been produced. The 16 hours of film Mr. Choephel sent to India during the first weeks of his project simply contain footage of the traditional music and dance he said he had gone to document. 
Persistent inquiries to Chinese authorities regarding Mr. Choephel's whereabouts and the condition of his health have produced little information. I wrote to the head of the Chinese Communist Party soon after Mr. Choephel's detention and received no reply. I raised his case personally in meetings with President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese officials last November in Beijing and received no reply. I have written to President Jiang since then to urge his personal intervention in this case and received no reply. I am just one of many who have sought information about Mr. Choephel to no avail. As of today we have no information as to where Mr. Choephel is being held, or even if he is still alive. 
This is an outrageous situation. A former Fulbright Scholar has been deprived of 18 years of his life as a result of spurious charges by a government that will not even reveal his whereabouts. I have urged the White House to raise Mr. Choephel's case with President Jiang. I plan to do the same. If President Jiang is interested in fostering closer ties with the United States, he could make no gesture more meaningful than ordering his release.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman in a colloquy. As the chairman knows, the Senate provided $100 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the stateside matching grant program. I want to thank the chairman for recognizing the interests of over 30 Senators to revitalize this program. When the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created, the State matching program was launched to assist States in the acquisition of parks and recreation facilities. This is as it should be. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was created on the premise that revenues generated by the depletion of our Nation's energy resource should be reinvested in the conservation of our resources through land acquisition for Federal, State and local priorities. The matching grants have helped finance over 37,500 park and recreation projects throughout the United States. These are projects each one of us can identify in our home States that are now used as ballparks, hiking trails, river access, and greenspace. Although the conference report does not set aside funds for the State matching program, the Interior Department may use part of the $700 million appropriation for this purpose. Is that correct?

Mr. LEAHY. Am I correct then that under existing authority, the Secretary of the Interior may use these funds for the State matching program with the approval of the House and Senate Appropriations Committee? As the chairman is aware, the National Conference of Mayors, the Western Governors Association, and the National Association of Governors urged Congress to appropriate funds for this program. You have already stated your commitment to the budget agreement that allocated the $700 million for land acquisition. Do you agree that revitalization of the State matching program could be a component of the Interior Department project list sent to the Appropriations Committees for use of this Land and Water Conservation Fund appropriation?

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last month, the President of the United States devoted a national radio address to the threats being posed to our federal judiciary by the campaign of intimidation, including the stall in confirming judicial nominees for the almost 100 vacancies that persist nationwide. It is a sad day when the President must remind the Senate of its constitutional responsibilities to consider and confirm qualified nominees to the Federal bench. I regret that we have reached this point.

Mr. LEAHY. I have previously included in the Record on July 31 a letter dated July 14 to Senator Lott from the presidents of seven national legal associations similarly urging the Senate to act to preserve the integrity of our justice system by fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to expedite the confirmation process for federal judges so that longstanding vacancies could be filled. These bar association presidents noted the `looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial positions.' 
Last month also saw the publication of a report by People for the American Way entitled `Justice Delayed, Justice Denied: The Right Wing Attack on the Independent Judiciary.' This report concludes that the campaign attacking the legitimacy of the judiciary and pressuring the Senate not to process the judicial nominees of the President is resulting in the judiciary not having the judges it needs to fulfil its responsibilities: 
Dockets are backing up, cases are going unheard for years at a time, justice is being delayed. In the end, the right wing's campaign has increased the risk that the law will not be enforced because there are two few judges to enforce it. 
During the week of September 22 through September 26, National Public Radio broadcast a series of five reports on the federal judge shortage by correspondent Nina Totenberg. 
When a U.S. attorney can refer to the lack of courtrooms and Federal judges as a bottleneck in the criminal justice process and the chief judge of a Federal district court can acknowledge that the court is so overwhelmed with criminal cases that it is operating like an assembly line, that cases are not given the attention that they deserve and that you know that you're making a lot of mistakes with--because of the speed, we have reached a crisis. That is not American justice, that is not the Federal justice system on which all of us rely to protect our rights while enforcing the law. 
I have addressed the Senate on this problem on a number of occasions already this year, including March 19, March 20, April 10, May 1, May 14, May 23, June 16, July 31, September 4, September 5, September 11, September 25, September 26, October 9, and October 21. I have spoken of it at meetings of the Judiciary Committee on March 6, April 17, May 22, June 12, July 10, July 31, September 18 and October 9 and in Judicial Committee hearings on March 18, May 7, June 25, July 22, September 5, and September 30. 
The current vacancy crisis is having a devastating impact on the administration of justice in courts around the country. Let me note a few examples: 
In the Northern District of Texas, a family filed their lawsuit 7 years ago and is still waiting for their day in court. 
Chief Judge J. Phil Gilbert, head of trial court in the Southern District of Illinois, where two of the four judgeships are vacant, reported that his docket has been so burdened with criminal cases that he went for a year without having a hearing in a civil case. That happened despite the fact that 88 percent of the cases filed in all Federal trial courts were civil, while only 12 percent were criminal in 1996. 
In California, one family's 1994 lawsuit against police, filed after the family's 14-year-old child was killed in a police chase 6 years ago, is still pending. 
In Oregon, the Federal courts has stopped doing settlement conferences, an invaluable tool for resolving claims before trial, because of the unavailability of judges. 
Due to vacancy problems, the district court in San Diego is holding only 10 civil trials per year. 
In Florida, to reduce an expected backlog of 4,400 cases, 10 district court judges have announced that they will hold a 3-month marathon session in Tampa next year. 
In the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, for which the Senate has found time to include as a rider on an appropriations bill a politically inspired plan to split the circuit but not to fill any of the 10 vacancies that plague that Court, 100 oral argument panels and 600 hearings were canceled this year due to lack of judges. As a result, it takes a year after closing briefs have been filed to schedule oral arguments. 
Chief Judge Ralph Winter testified that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals expects to include a visiting judge on 80 percent of its panels over this year in light of the four unfilled vacancies on that court and its burgeoning workload. 
Across the country, the number of active cases pending for at least 3 years jumped 20 percent from 1995 to 1996, and there are now more than 16,000 Federal cases older than 3 years. 
These are real life examples of the harm caused by the irresponsible lack of action by this Senate in considering highly qualified judicial nominations. It is time for the Senate to fulfil its constitutional responsibility to confirm the Federal judges needed for the effective administration of justice. 
Judge Stephen Trott, formerly a high-ranking Reagan appointment in the Department of Justice, included the following summary of the situation in which the ninth circuit finds itself in light of the Senate's unwillingness to consider nominees to fill the vacancies that plague that court in an opinion that he wrote early this year: 
With nine [now ten] vacancies out of twenty-eight authorized judges in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . . . one wonders how Congress and the President expect us promptly to process our ever increasing 8,000-plus caseload. . . . Our current 9 [now 10] vacancies mean we will process 1,500 fewer cases this year than we could with a full bench. To the litigants who wait in line for us to resolve their disputes, this unnecessary disability is unpardonable. . . . In a country that prides itself on being a nation of laws rather than just a nation of leaders, and which exalts the rule of law as the appropriate method of resolving controversies, we must do better in keeping our civil and criminal justice system able without unnecessary delay to deliver to the People the important promises of our Constitution. 
In light of all of this, I was surprised to read the remarks of the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee in response to the President of the United States in the Record for September 29. The Senator from Utah referred to myths and distortions, but I do not believe that he could have been referring to the statement by the President. The President spoke the truth. There is a vacancy crisis in the Federal judiciary and there is a Republican slowdown of judicial confirmations. 
The Chief Justice of the United States recognized the crisis when in his 1996 end of the year report he noted:  
The number of judicial vacancies can have a profound impact on the courts ability to manage its caseload effectively. Because of the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the vacancy rate is beginning to climb. . . . It is hoped that the Administration and Congress will continue to recognize that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice. 
More recently, the Chief Justice termed the rising number of vacancies on the Federal bench `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' This is hardly a partisan statement but a recognition of the seriousness of the crisis posed by judicial vacancies. 
As for the slowdown, there are currently 27 judicial vacancies that the Administrative Office of the United States Courts terms judicial emergencies because they have been vacant for more than a year and one-half. Last year the President had sent 15 nominees to the Senate to fill judicial emergencies and all were returned without action at the end of the year. 
This year, after months of delay, the Senate finally filled judicial emergencies by confirming the nominations of Merrick Garland, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, Eric Clay, Arthur Gajarsa, Henry Harold Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Battalion, Katherine Sweeney Hayden, Richard Lazzara, Marjorie Rendell, and Richard C. Casey. Some of these nominations were pending before the Senate for periods of 18 months, 12 months, 16 months, 16 months, 19 months, and 17 months. 
Still, the Federal judiciary and American people face a record number of judicial emergency vacancies and await action on the nominations of Ann Aiken, James Beaty, Richard Caputo, William Fletcher, Bruce Kauffman, Stanley Marcus, Michael McCuskey, Margaret McKeown, Susan Oki Mollway, Margaret Morrow, Richard Paez, Anabelle Rodriguez, Michael Schattman, Christina Snyder, Clarence Sundram, Hilda Tagle, Jame Ware, and Helene White, who are pending before the Senate eager to get to work and fill them. 
We have seen 115 judicial vacancies over the course of this year. The Senate has seen fit to confirm only 21 nominees. More than 50 additional nominees remain pending in committee and before the Senate. The Senate is not even keeping pace with attrition. Since the adjournment of Congress last year, judicial vacancies have increased by almost 50 percent. Indeed, this net increase in judicial vacancies, 29, still exceeds the number of judges confirmed over the course of the year, 21, and likely will when the Senate adjourns in November. 
I have not attacked Senator Hatch on this floor and will not today. I know that if it were up to him we would be doing better, we would have fewer judicial vacancies and they would have been filled more quickly. I have asked him to hold more hearings and to consider nominations more expeditiously. 
I thought we might be seeing a change in the atmosphere in the Senate in September. Anticipation of the President's radio address on the judicial vacancy crisis obviously reached the Senate. Even those who have been holding up the confirmations of Federal judges were uncomfortable defending this Senate's dismal record of having proceeded on only 9 of the 61 nominees received through August of this year. 
As rumors of the President's impending address circulated around Capitol Hill, the Senate literally doubled its confirmations from 9 to 18 in the course of 23 days in September and forth first time all year achieved the snail-like pace of confirming 2 judges a month while still faced with almost 100 vacancies. 
September was the only month all year that the Judiciary Committee held two confirmation hearings for judicial nominees during a single calendar month. 
Following the wave of attention generated by the President's address, however, the Republican majority has reverted to its prior destructive course and the Judiciary Committee has yet to hold a hearing for any of the more than 40 nominees who have yet to be according hearings this year. 
The President has sent the Senate 73 judicial nominations so far this year. The Senate has confirmed 21 judges. From the first day of this session of Congress, the Judiciary Committee has never worked through its backlog of nominees and has never had pending before it fewer than 20 judicial nominees awaiting hearings. The Committee's backlog has doubled, with 10 of these nominations having been pending since at least 1996; 5 have been pending since 1995. 
Early this year, Chairman Hatch worked hard to bring the nomination of Merrick Garland to a vote. He gave that nominee his strong personal endorsement and fought for him. After an 18-month delay over 2 years, that outstanding nominee was finally confirmed 77 to 23. During that debate, the Christian Coalition circulated a letter opposing this outstanding nominee. Senator Hatch concluded the debate on the confirmation of Merrick Garland observing that he was sick of those playing politics with judges. I agreed with him then and still do. Unfortunately, the stall has continued and some in his party have continued to play very dangerous politics with judges. 
In the last five rollcall votes on judicial nominees, there has been a cumulative total of one negative vote by a single Senator. Five judges were confirmed by unanimous rollcall votes and one was confirmed 98 to 1. The only judicial nominee to receive any negative votes was Judge Merrick Garland of the District of Columbia Circuit. He was opposed by the majority leader and 22 other Republican Senators. He was well qualified and was confirmed. That confirmation took over 18 months from when the Senate received the nomination. 
Another of the well-qualified nominees who has been delayed far too long is Margaret Morrow. I spoke of her earlier this week when the Senate acted in less than 7 weeks to confirm the nominee to the district court in Utah. Unfortunately, not every nominee fills a vacancy in the home state of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
In contrast to the Senate's treatment of the Kimball nomination, Margaret Morrow's nomination has been pending before the Senate for over 16 months and pending on the Senate calendar awaiting action for more than 7 months. 
Last year this nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee and was left to wither without action for over 3 months. This year, the committee again reported the nomination favorably and it has been pending for another 4 months. There has been no explanation for this delay and no justification. This good woman does not deserve this shameful treatment. 
Senator Hatch noted in his recent statement on September 29 that he will continue to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that he will vote for her. He said: `I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on her behalf.' 
I have looked forward to that debate since June 12 when she was favorably reported to the Senate for a second time. This is a nomination that has been pending for far too long and that has been stalled here on the floor twice over 2 years without justification. 
Meanwhile, the people served by the District Court for the Central District of California continue to suffer the effects of this persistent vacancy--cases are not heard, criminal cases are not being tried. This is one of the many vacancies that have persisted for so long that they are classified as judicial emergency vacancies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. There are four vacancies in the court for Los Angeles and the Central District of California. Nominees have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee for both of the judicial emergency vacancies in this district but both Margaret Morrow and Christina Snyder have been stalled on the Senate calendar. 
This is a district court with over 300 cases that have been pending for longer than 3 years and in which the time for disposing of criminal felony cases and the number of cases filed increased over the last year. Judges in this district handle approximately 400 cases a year, including somewhere between 40 and 50 criminal felony cases. Still these judicial vacancies are being perpetuated without basis or cause by a Republican leadership that refuses to vote on these well-qualified nominees. 
I am told that last week a Republican Senator announced at a speech before a policy institute that he has a hold on the Morrow nomination. A press release stated that he had placed a hold on Margaret Morrow's nomination because he wants to `be able to debate the nomination and seek a recorded vote.' I, too, want Senate consideration of this nomination and am prepared to record my vote. 
After being on the Senate calendar for a total of 7 months, this nomination has been delayed too long. I believe all would agree that it is time for the full Senate to debate this nomination and vote on it. I have inquired about a time agreement but gotten no response. Now that an opponent has finally come forward to identify himself, I look forward to a prompt debate and a vote on this nomination in accordance with the apparent commitment of the majority leader. I look forward to that debate. I ask again, as I have done repeatedly over the last several months, why not now, why not today, why not this week? 
I again urge the majority leader to call up the nomination of Margaret Morrow for a vote. She has suffered enough. The people of the Central District of California have been denied this outstanding jurist for long enough. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said last month that he had the assurance of the majority leader that she will be called up for a vote but neither has said when that will be. I hope that the majority leader will proceed to the consideration of this nomination and that he will support Margaret Morrow to be a district court judge for the Central District of California. 
Madam President, the reason I say that I am concerned that the President had to speak to this is that we should not have to be reminded of our constitutional duties. Indeed, the President was right in reminding us of this. I have served here now with numerous majority leaders--Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, Senator George Mitchell of Maine--and all of these leaders of both parties are strong partisans for their parties, but all shared the responsibility as majority leader that there are certain things the Senate must do, and it is the responsibility of the leader to see that the Senate does it. One of those things, of course, is to see that the Senate votes on Presidential nominations to the Federal bench. Now, every Senator can vote against any nominee. Every Senator has that right. They can vote against them this committee and on the floor. But it is the responsibility of the U.S. Senate to at least bring them to a vote. It is our responsibility under the Constitution, it is our responsibility to the Senate itself, it is our responsibility to the American public not to allow 1 Senator to determine for all 100 Senators whether a person will be confirmed to a Federal judicial position or not. All Senators should be allowed to vote, and today they are not. 
We really have not done our job as Senators. We have not fulfilled our responsibility to the Constitution. We have not fulfilled our responsibility to this body. We have not fulfilled our responsibility to advise and consent. And we certainly have not fulfilled our responsibility to the American people or the Federal judiciary. 
I hope we might reach a point where we as a Senate will accept our responsibility and vote people up or vote them down. Bring the names here. If we want to vote against them, vote against them. But time after time after time I hear that there are vacancies where people are really concerned, a lot of Senators have a concern about this person. Then we come to a vote and 99 out of 100 Senators or all 100 Senators vote for that person. 
This is not a fair way to do it. This is not being responsible. This is something, frankly, as I have said to my good friend, the majority leader, and he is my good friend, this is something that none of the majority leaders I have served with have ever allowed to happen, Republican or Democrat. Why? Because it would not be responsible. Why? Because it affects the administration of justice. Why? Because it fails our responsibility to the American public. Why? Because it is beneath the Senate of the United States. We should get on with the process.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Dale A. Kimball to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Utah. Mr. Kimball has been engaged in the private practice of law for 30 years and is currently the senior partner in the Salt Lake City law firm, Kimball, Parr, Waddoups, Brown & Gee. The ABA unanimously found him to be well-qualified for this appointment. 
We received Mr. Kimball's nomination on September 5, 1997. He participated in a confirmation hearing on September 30 and was unanimously reported by the committee on October 9. Now, less than 7 weeks after receiving his nomination, the Senate has confirmed this nominee. Had the Senate not taken a recess last week, I suspect this nominee would have been confirmed in less than 6 weeks. Nonetheless, 7 weeks is a good benchmark against which to consider our progress on other judicial nominations. 
I congratulate Mr. Kimball and his family and look forward to his service on the U.S. district court. 
I also congratulate Richard C. Casey on his confirmation as a district judge for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Casey is both an accomplished legal practitioner and a true inspiration. He has been associated with, and a partner of the law firm of Brown & Wood in New York City since 1964. Remarkably, he has been practicing law without his eyesight since the early 1980's--a congenital disease stripped him of his ability to see. Dedicated to serving the blind community of New York City, Mr. Casey is a member of the board of directors for organizations such as Guiding Eyes for the Blind, Catholic Guild for the Blind, and Ski for Light. 
I congratulate Mr. Casey and his family and anticipate his outstanding service on the U.S. Federal Court. 
We have experienced 115 judicial vacancies over the course of this year. These are only the 20th and 21st nominees that the Senate has confirmed. More than 50 additional nominees remain pending in committee and before the Senate. The Senate is not even keeping pace with attrition for since the adjournment of Congress last year, judicial vacancies have increased by almost 50 percent. 
Another of the well-qualified nominees who has been delayed far too long is Margaret Morrow. Her nomination has been pending before the Senate for over 16 months. Last year this nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee and was left to wither without action for over 3 months. This year, the committee again reported the nomination favorably and it has been pending for another 4 months. There has been no explanation for this delay and no justification. This good woman does not deserve this shameful treatment. 
Senator Hatch noted in his recent statement on September 29 that he will continue to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that he will vote for her. He said: `I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on her behalf.'

The Senator's press release stated that he had placed a hold on Margaret Morrow's nomination because he wants to `be able to debate the nomination and seek a recorded vote.' I too want to debate the nomination of Margaret Morrow and have been seeking Senate consideration of this outstanding nominee for many months. After being on the Senate calendar for a total of 7 months, this nomination has been delayed too long. 
I believe all would agree that it is time for the full Senate to debate this nomination and vote on it. I have inquired about a time agreement but gotten no response.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I would like bring to the attention of the Senate a breast cancer survivor in Vermont who has poured herself into reaching out to others who are dealing with this devastating disease, and who has made finding a cure her lifetime crusade. 
Pat Barr of Bennington, VT, is a true example of one person being able to make a difference. 
It was a visit in early 1992 from Pat and several other Vermont women--grassroots organizers and survivors of breast cancer--that led to my long involvement in working with others to address the urgent need for more intensive research on breast cancer, which has taken the lives of more than 1 million women over the past 35 years. 
Soon after that visit I was joined by several Members of Congress in starting a congressional campaign to help eradicate breast cancer. We began by introducing a resolution urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to declare breast cancer a public health emergency. The resolution raised public awareness about breast cancer and sent a strong message that we needed to accelerate the investigation into the causes, treatments, and prevention of this illness. 
Pat Barr's support, energy, and determination to make a difference has immeasurably helped me in efforts to elevate breast cancer research as a Federal priority, including in the annual Department of Defense budget, where we have been able to allocate $737.5 million for breast cancer research over the past 6 years. 
She also worked closely with Congressman Sanders and with me in envisioning and crafting a new tool in the struggle to find a cure for all cancers: the National Program for Cancer Registries. Cancer registries serve as a foundation for a national, comprehensive prevention strategy. They monitor trends in the incidence of breast cancers and other cancers and in mortality rates, as well as offering a source for population-based epidemiologic research at NIH and other research institutions. 
For a decade, Pat has tirelessly volunteered her time and energy to this effort. Pat is the founder of the Breast Cancer Network of Vermont. She has been a board member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition since its inception in 1991. She has served as a consumer advocate on panels at the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Army Breast Cancer Research Program. 
Earlier this year, Vermonters honored Pat by dedicating the annual Vermont Race for the Cure in her honor. 
A recent editorial in the Bennington Banner said it best: `Pat Barr is a hero worth honoring.'

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a profoundly disturbing report issued by Human Rights Watch on July 18 about the abduction of children by a heavily armed Ugandan rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army. 
While the precise number of children abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army is unknown, estimates indicate that over the past 2 years, 3 to 5 thousand children have escaped from the rebel group. It is reported that an equal number of abducted children remain in captivity and an unknown number have died. 
According to Human Rights Watch, abduction is only the beginning of the extreme violence and degradation faced by these children. Often as young as 8 years old, the children are tortured, raped, and sometimes killed by members of the Lord's Resistance Army. They are forced to take part in combat, serving as front line forces in battles against the Ugandan Army and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. The children also tell of being made to beat and kill fellow captives who have been apprehended in their efforts to escape. The physical and emotional trauma resulting from such experiences can cause lifelong problems to those children that do survive. 
The abduction of children for military purposes not only violates the provisions of common article 3 of the Geneva conventions of 1949, international standards established by protocol II to the Geneva conventions of 1949, and the Convention of the Rights of the Child, it violates the most basic principles of human morality. 
It is reported that the camps established by the Ugandan Government to contend with displaced children and their families are extremely inadequate. Crowded conditions and a lack of food and sanitation facilities have resulted in malnutrition, disease, and death among those who have sought refuge in these camps. Trauma counseling centers for children who have escaped from the rebels are sorely in need of basic supplies and qualified staff. Human Rights Watch reports that the children who are told to leave in order to make room for new arrivals often have nowhere to go and no means of support. 
Mr. President, the phenomenon of the child soldier is growing not only in Uganda, but around the world. If a more concerted effort is not made to address the outrageous abuses these children face, Uganda and the rest of the international community will be contending with the consequences far in the future.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader had decided to take up the nomination of Judge Anthony W. Ishii to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern District of California. Judge Ishii is an outstanding nominee. He is currently a municipal court judge in Fresno, California. The ABA found him to be well-qualified, its highest rating. 
We first received Anthony Ishii's nomination on February 12, 1997, almost eight months ago. He had a confirmation hearing on June 25, where he was strongly supported by both California Senators. He was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee back on July 10. There has been no explanation or justification for the delay in bringing this nomination forward from the Senate calendar. I am sure that Judge Ishii and his family are happy that their long wait is now over. I congratulate them and look forward to his service on the District Court. 
Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has chosen again to skip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow. In spite of the adoption of the Wysen-Grassley amendment earlier this month, an amendment that calls upon Senators to come forward within two days of exercising a hold to identify themselves, Margaret Morrow's nomination has been the subject of an anonymous and mysterious hold over a period of two years and most recently since being reported on June 12, almost four months ago. 
On September 29 Senator Hatch reiterated his continuing support for the nomination of Margaret Morrow and announced that he will vote for her. He said: `I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on her behalf.' 
I have looked forward to that debate since June 12. I ask, again, why not now, why not today, why not this week? This is a nomination that has been pending for far too long and that has been stalled here on the floor twice over two years without justification. Last year this nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee and was left to wither without action for over three months. This year, the Committee again reported her nomination favorably and it has been pending for another four months. There has been no explanation for this delay and no justification. This good woman does not deserve this shameful treatment. 
Meanwhile, the people served by the District Court for the Central District of California continue to suffer the affects of this persistent vacancy--cases are not heard, criminal cases are not being tried. This is one of more than 28 vacancies that have persisted for so long that they are classified as `judicial emergency' vacancies by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. 
When the President spoke out in his national radio address, he asked that the delay in the consideration of judicial nominees come to an end. Unfortunately, the delay continues with respect to too many nominations, including that of Margaret Morrow.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I just want to make reference to the comments just made by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, my friend and colleague of 23 years. He has served here much longer than that. I have had the opportunity to serve with him for now almost 23 years. 
Mr. President, I have made it very clear in speeches on the floor and comments to the public and people back in my home State of Vermont that I completely agree with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on the question of the line-item veto. 
I was one of those, as he knows, who voted against the line-item veto. I recall when he first came trying to say something to me about it. He may well recall this: I said, `You don't even have to lay out the arguments. I can't imagine why anybody in any legislative body would want to give up the power of the purse strings to the Executive.' 
Again, I do not blame the Executive for asking for it. If any Executive thought that the legislative body would be foolish enough to just hand over the most significant part of their power to them, well, few Executives could resist the temptation.

Mr. LEAHY. I say to my good friend from West Virginia, who has as strong and abiding history as any person I have had the privilege of serving with, that it goes back to George Washington, that more of us should say we want to go back to George Washington. 
Unfortunately, we have a lot of people who give discussions about what were the Founders' intention, what was in the Constitution. I sometimes wonder if they have read either the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, or any history less recent than their latest poll. 
I say this because I heard some Members say in the last couple days that they wonder whether they made the right decision in voting for that line-item veto but did not go on to say, `But it was so popular in the polls'--so popular in the polls. 
My good friend from West Virginia has read much on decisions made by those who were at the drafting and introduction of the Magna Carta, has certainly read The Federalist Papers more than anybody else here. He has read the decisions that have been made at very difficult times in our history. And I suspect at most of those nobody was doing any polling. 
I do not think that the Founders in Philadelphia--I do not think there were many polls being taken. There were certainly discussions among people who had a great sense of not only history but the history they were creating and the country they were putting together. 
I suspect also, and my friend from West Virginia would probably agree with this, I suspect also there were many, many there who read, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia knows, what happened to the Roman Senate. Caesar was given the power of the purse. 
I think it is an interesting thing because shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union, we had many visits here from parliamentarians coming to see how to set up a democracy. I am still struck by one group from Russia who sat in my office asking, how do you do some of these things? Suppose your President said, `No, we will build this weapon and we will do that,' and you said, `No,' how could you stop him? I said we would not give him the money, and they said, `You mean you can do that?' That is why, after 200 years of being the most powerful nation on Earth, we are still a democracy. We are not a dictatorship because there is that check and balance. 
I hope some who feel set upon because their own projects may have been vetoed, if they would go back and read history and think not just to be concerned because they are discomfited for the moment, but be more concerned that they put an enormous hole in the walls that set up the checks and balances in our Nation. 
Does a Congress always use the power of the purse wisely? Of course not. I can point to times I have been on the losing end in battles on appropriations and spending bills. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia rarely loses, but can still think, I am sure, of times he may have. But it was the Senate working its will. It was the other House working its will. And then, if the President doesn't like it, veto it, veto the bill. 
I might say, and my friend from West Virginia will remember, we have had a number of times in appropriations bills that we pass where the President really was against one particular point, and we sent it down, and he vetoed it. Then we entered into a process of negotiation and the bill gets passed again, and maybe that item, that one item he wanted out, was taken out. But he had to make that whole decision of thinking they lost the whole bill in doing it, and we had to, too. It is a two-way street up and down Pennsylvania Avenue. Now we just send it to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
I say to my friends here in the Senate, don't always jump to what is popular in the polls, especially if it hurts the country. The most popular part of the Contract With America, the most popular part, was term limits. Now, that struck so close to the bone that those who would sign the Contract With America made darn sure no term-length-limit bills went through. 
There were five or six different versions, so everybody could vote for something, but no one version would pass. That struck close to home so that went through. Things that strike close to home like that are pay raises and what not. 
What I say is, think about the country itself. The line-item veto is not a way in any democracy for a parliamentary party to give up its powers. 
I thank my friend from West Virginia for raising the point. I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for those who are planning schedules, I do not expect to take long, but I will speak about an issue that I have talked about many times, the issue of landmines, something, I must admit, I think about in waking hours and sometimes in my dreams. 
There was an ad in yesterday's Roll Call newspaper. It said: 
There's just one problem with President Clinton's `landmine ban.' . . . It doesn't ban landmines. 
An ad in the Hill newspaper 2 days ago asked the question: 
Would a landmine by any other name be as deadly? 
That may seem like a strange question because the answer is so obvious. Landmines are those tiny hidden explosives that kill and maim randomly. They are strewn by the thousands, by the tens of millions, in over 100 million in over 60 countries. 
They do things like what is shown in this photograph. They do it to children in as many foreign countries as there are States in the United States. That was a healthy young child walking down a road. That child in a single instant was maimed, crippled for the rest of his life, if he survives the surgery he will have to undergo. If he survives, he will grow up in a poor country with one arm, one leg and somehow be expected to make a living. 
Imagine if something like this was happening in the United States. We would call it terrorism. We would make it a Federal crime. We would do everything possible to stop it. At my own home in Vermont, I can walk through acres of fields and woods, I can do it easily at this time of the year, in the great beauty of the fall foliage. If I was in most of these other countries, I would not dare step off the traveled part of the road. 
So there should not be any question about what a landmine is. For hundreds of millions of people around the world, they are a daily, deadly nightmare. Everyday on their way to the fields, or to gather water or in school yards or on roads once safe to travel, innocent people, often children, are blown to bits by these indiscriminate weapons. 
A year ago at the United Nations, President Clinton called on the nations of the world to ban antipersonnel landmines. The President said: 
The United States will lead a global effort to eliminate these terrible weapons and stop the enormous loss of human life. 
Those were inspiring words. I commend him today for saying them; I commended him at the time. 
But today we are confronted with a question we thought had been answered a long time ago: When is a landmine a landmine? 
It is relevant today because 2 weeks ago, rather than join 89 other nations, including most of our NATO allies, in agreeing to sign a treaty to ban antipersonnel mines, the White House resorted to doublespeak. Rather than make the hard choice, the right choice, rather than pledge unambiguously to do away with these weapons, they said one thing but then they did another. They said the United States would ban antipersonnel mines, but then in the same breath, they redefined what an antipersonnel landmine is so they wouldn't have to ban them after all. 
Mr. President, some people were fooled, but not many. A September 24 article in the Washington Post begins with the same question: 
When is an antipersonnel landmine . . . no longer an antipersonnel landmine? 
When the President of the United States says so. 
I am told that article upset some people in the Pentagon. I am not surprised. When the Pentagon tried to explain that a weapon that just a few months ago they called an antipersonnel landmine is no longer an antipersonnel landmine today--they said it was yesterday; today they say it is not--it is like watching someone who is caught telling a lie that even he convinced himself was not a lie, and then acting offended at the suggestion he tried to pull a fast one. 
A weapon they once called a landmine, now isn't. Why do they say that? So they can say `Look, we banned landmines. Except some of them we renamed so we can still use them.' It is Orwellian at best. 
The Pentagon thought they could come up with a nifty way to get around a landmine ban that they never wanted. They asked themselves, `How can we be part of a treaty that bans antipersonnel mines, and still keep using them? We'll just call landmines something different. Then you don't really have to ban them, you can just say you are.' 
If antipersonnel mines are used in the vicinity of an antitank mine, then they miraculously become something different from an antipersonnel landmine even though that is what they were called just a few monts ago. Without changing in any way, shape or form or explosive capability, they suddenly become a submunition, not a landmine. 
Thank God, Mr. President, we have banned landmines from our arsenal. Only now we have submunitions. I am waiting for the appropriations bill to come forward to pay to relabel these millions of former landmines. Somebody will have to paint over where it says `landmine' and relabel them as `submunitions.' And since submunitions are not banned, presto, the United States can say it is banning landmines even though everyone knows we are not. 
Unfortunately, this kind of cynical ploy is seen too often in Washington. That is the problem.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, there are serious issues here. One, of course, is about pretending a landmine is something else, in a last-minute attempt to avoid being embarrassed by being left out of an international treaty that the United States called for a year ago. It is embarrassing. We urged other nations to negotiate a treaty, and when they did we stayed out of the negotiations until the last minute and then we said we would not sign it. 
But another serious question is what to do with certain types of antitank mines that the United States has in its arsenal and that are packaged with antipersonnel mines. 
I fully understand how important the Pentagon considers these weapons to our defense. I have spoken with people in the Pentagon about this. I do not intend to minimize this problem. What I am saying, though, is face the problem, be straight about it, do not play word games. 
Because it is just as important that the United States support a landmine ban. If we are not going to be among the 100 nations that sign the treaty in Ottawa this December--and I understand that is the President's decision--then we need to find a way to remove the obstacles that keep us from signing, because I the United States needs to be part of this treaty. If that means redesigning our antitank mines, then that is what we ought to do. 
We need to sign the treaty as soon as possible, because as remarkable an accomplishment as it is, without the United States it is never going to achieve the international ban that everyone, including the President, wants. No country has the ability that the United States has to broaden support for the treaty and obtain adherence to it. Nobody can exert the leadership that the world's only superpower can exert. The American people do not want the United States to use a weapon that does not belong in the arsenal of civilized nations. They do not want the United States to be standing in the way of a treaty that will set a new moral standard for the next century. As the most powerful Nation, it is time to put an end to the doublespeak and the excuses and get busy solving the problem. 
Mr. President, I said when I spoke in Oslo to the representatives of nations and organizations that were meeting there, I dream of a century, a new century, when armies of humanity dig up, disarm, and destroy landmines and nobody--nobody--puts new landmines down. Think what a century that would be for the children and the children of the children in those countries. 
Think what that would mean to the United States when it sends peacekeepers around the world, when it sends humanitarian workers, missionaries, doctors, whatever. Think what it would mean if they did not have to face the constant threat of landmines. 
Think what it would mean if we could go into countries that today have to spend their scarce resources to import food because their people cannot go into their fields to plant or to harvest, fields that are death traps because of landmines. There might be only one landmine in a field, but if you do not know where that landmine is, there may as well be a hundred. 
Think what it would mean if we could go to countries ravaged by civil war and now reaching toward democracy, to help them rebuild the infrastructure they need and not have to spend money on removing landmines, expending $100 to $1,000 to remove a $3 or $5 landmine. 
Think how wonderful it would be if our country did not have to fund, every year now to the tune of $5 million, the Leahy War Victims Fund which pays for artificial limbs--something that is supported, I say with gratitude, by every Member of this Senate, Republican and Democrat. But think if we did not have to do that. Think if we would not have to see children learning to walk on crude prosthetics. Think what a different world it would be. 
We have worked to ban nuclear testing. We have worked to ban chemical weapons. Far more civilians have died and been injured and maimed by landmines than by nuclear weapons or chemical weapons. 
We can find a way to protect the legitimate defense needs of the United States and to maintain our legitimate obligations around the world whether on the Korean Peninsula or anywhere else. We can do that and still be part of the remarkable global effort to ban landmines. 
Mr. President, I have been in many countries where I have gotten out of a car and been told where I should walk, to be careful, that I should step only here, not a foot away. I remember in one country I was about to step off the road and somebody grabbed my arm and yanked me back because there were landmines there. 
These are things I remember, and they are a daily terror for people who live there. 
Mr. President, let us join together to bring that to an end.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join as a cosponsor of the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997, S. 1189. 
This legislation would provide greater protection to Federal judges, law enforcement officers, and their families. Specifically, our legislation would: Increase the maximum prison term for forcible assaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation, or interference with a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 years imprisonment to 8 years; increase the maximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily injury against a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase the maximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member of the immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and the U.S. Marshals Service. 
It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs this legislation to protect the hard-working men and women who serve in our Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, unfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence against officials of our Federal Government. 
Earlier this year, for example, a courtroom in Urbana, IL, was firebombed, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This follows the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the Federal office building in Oklahoma City 2 years ago. More recently in my home State, a Vermont border patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl Drega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement officers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that day, Drega shot and killed two State troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. Apparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the judge who had ruled against him in a land dispute. 
There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking the law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or law enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshals Service is concerned with more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement officers. 
The extreme rhetoric that some are using to attack the judiciary only feeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives was recently quoted as saying: `The judges need to be intimidated,' and if they do not behave, `we're going to go after them in a big way.' I know that House Republican Whip Tom Delay was not intending to encourage violence against any Federal official, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal judges in the eyes of the public. 
Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate and violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve within it with the respect that is essential to its preserving its public standing. 
We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people and countries around the world that are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, coequal branch of Government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment. 
We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the Federal judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public servants that make up the Federal Government, who are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that it takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal judiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that these are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. They deserve our respect and our protection. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997 and look forward to its swift enactment.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted to see two more hostages released by the Republican majority to serve the American people as Federal judges. 
Anticipation of the President's radio address on the judicial vacancy crisis has obviously reached the Senate. I expect even those who have spent so much time this year holding up the confirmations of Federal judges were uncomfortable defending this Senate's record of having proceeded on only 9 of the 61 nominees received through August of this year. As rumors of the President's impending address have circulated around Capitol Hill, this Senate has literally doubled its confirmations from 9 to 18 in the course of 23 days. That demonstrates just how low the Senate's output has been over the first 8 months of this year. With these two confirmations, the Senate will have finally achieved the snail-like pace of confirming two judges a month while still faced with almost 100 vacancies. 
Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has once again chosen to skip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that of Christina Snyder who have been nominated to be district court judges in the Central District of California. As I detailed again yesterday, Ms. Morrow has been the victim of a mysterious hold for months. 
Marjorie Rendell has been a fine district court judge since 1994. President Clinton nominated her to a seat on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on the first day of this session. At the time, I could not have imagined that it would take nine months for the Judiciary Committee to accord her a hearing and report her nomination to the Senate. Senator Specter and Senator Biden are both to be commended for pressing their efforts to have this nomination considered. Indeed, Senator Specter ultimately chaired her confirmation hearing. 
Judge Rendell received the ABA's highest rating of well qualified for appointment to the third circuit. She has been active in the Visiting Nurse Association of Greater Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Bar Foundation and active in the community. Senator Kennedy described her career as `one of great distinction and insight.' Even Senator Sessions concurred that Judge Rendell `was a very impressive witness.' 
The good news is that her confirmation fills a vacancy on the third circuit, the bad news is that it creates a vacancy on the district court at a time when it is taking far too long to confirm good nominees. 
I congratulate Judge Rendell and her family and look forward to her service on the third circuit. 
I am delighted to see the Senate moving forward with the nomination of Richard Lazzara to be a Federal judge in the Middle District of Florida. The Senate first received this nomination in early May 1996, over 16 months ago. It should not have taken us this long to get to this point. 
I know that the chief judge in that district, Elizabeth Kovachevich, has been speaking out about the workload, backlogs and vacancies in her court. Judge Kovachevich has noted that serious crimes are up 28 percent in her district and civil filings are up 25 percent for the second straight year leading to a growing backlog of over 3,200 cases. Both Senator Graham and Senator Mack were strong supporters of this nominee at his hearing in early September. I was struck that Senator Mack called the situation one of `crisis proportions' and pointed out that the district is having to take unprecedented steps to deal with a backlog growing `at an alarming proportion.' 
I have introduced legislation recommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States to add three additional judges for that district, but their needs remain unaddressed because that bill has not received the attention that it deserves. 
Filling this vacancy without further delay is a start. The people of Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa have had to wait a long time for judge Lazzara. This nominee received the highest rating possible from the American Bar Association. He is an experienced Judge, having served as a Florida County judge, a Florida circuit judge and a Florida appellate judge over the last 10 years. 
I congratulate Judge Lazzara and his family and look forward to his service on the Federal Court. 
With Senate confirmation of these two judges, the Senate continues to lag well behind the pace established by Majority Leader Dole and Chairman Hatch in the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, the Senate had confirmed 36 Federal judges. With today's actions, the Senate will have confirmed one-half that number, only 18 judges. We still face almost 100 vacancies and have over 50 pending nominees to consider with more arriving each week. 
For purposes of perspective, let us also recall that by the end of September 1992, during the last year of President Bush's term, a Democratic majority in the Senate had confirmed 59 of the 72 nominees sent to us by a Republican President. This Senate is on pace to confirm less than one-third of a comparable number of nominations. 
We still have more than 47 nominees among the 69 nominations sent to the Senate by the President pending before the Judiciary Committee who have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day of this session, having been re-nominated by the President. Several of those pending before the committee had hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago persist. The Committee has 10 nominees who have been pending for more than a year, including 5 who have been pending since 1995. 
While I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with the confirmations of Judge Rendell and Mr. Lazzara, there remains no excuse for the Committee's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Prof. William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably reported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been passed over so far this year. Nor is there any explanation or excuse for the Senate not immediately proceeding to consider the other five judicial nominations pending on the Senate calendar. 
Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot try the cases and incarcerate the guilty if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day. National Public Radio has been running a series of reports all this week on the judicial crises and quoted the chief judge and U.S. attorney from San Diego earlier this week to the effect that criminal matters are being affected. 
I have spoken about the crisis being created by the vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At the rate that we are going, we are not keeping up with attrition. When we adjourned last Congress there were 64 vacancies on the Federal bench. After the confirmation of 18 judges in 9 months, there has been a net increase of 30 vacancies, an increase of almost 50 percent in the number of Federal judicial vacancies. 
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' Senator Hatch has said that we can do better. I agree with them and add that we must do better. I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of these fine women and men to reconsider their action and work with us to have the Senate fulfill its constitutional responsibility.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the 40th anniversary of the beginning of the end of racial segregation in the public schools in Little Rock, AR. As we turn to reflect on Little Rock and the aftermath of the Supreme Court's landmark decision on public school segregation, we should consider the important lessons those times still hold for us today. Little Rock was a testing point in our history when the rule of law and respect for our courts and Constitution prevailed. 
Three years earlier, the Supreme Court's unanimous Brown versus Board of Education decision prompted a concerted assault on the judiciary. On March 12, 1956, 81 Members of Congress signed a resolution condemning that ruling as a `clear abuse of judicial power' and part of a `trend in the Federal judiciary to legislate, in derogation of the authority of Congress, and to encroach upon the reserved rights of the people.' Billboards sprouted around the country demanding the impeachment of Chief Justice Earl Warren. Justice Clarence Thomas recalls that as a young man his `most vivid childhood memory of the Supreme Court was the `Impeach Earl Warren' signs that lined Highway 17 near Savannah. I didn't understand who this Earl Warren fellow was, but I knew he was in some kind of trouble.' 
It should concern all of us that a pattern resembling that which followed the Supreme Court's decision in Brown is being repeated. It has once again become fashionable in some quarters to sloganeer about impeaching Federal judges. This year's continuing attack on the judicial branch, the slowdown in the processing of the scores of good women and men the President has nominated to fill vacancies on the Federal courts, and widespread threats of impeachment are all part of a partisan, ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary. Extremist elements have turned their fire on the branch of Government most protective of our freedoms but the least equipped to protect itself from political attacks. 
We are hearing from some Members of Congress a clamor for impeachment when a judge renders a decision that irritates them. We are hearing demands that Congress destroy the orderly process of appellate court and Supreme Court review and, instead, assume the role of a supercourt that would legislatively review and veto individual decisions. We are seeing proposals to amend the Constitution, to eliminate the independence and lifetime tenure of judges. Extreme rhetoric and outlandish proposals have contributed to a poisonous atmosphere in which the Federal justice system is overloaded. 
Last week on the 210th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution, a newspaper reported that the majority leader of the Senate applauded the idea of Republicans plotting to intimidate the Federal judiciary, commenting that `it sounds like a good idea to me.' For the majority leader of the Senate to join an acknowledged attack on the independence and integrity of the Federal judiciary is a troubling and disappointing development that shows how easily political leaders can succumb to such political temptations, even at the expense of the checks and balances that are needed to protect our rights. 
It is one thing to criticize the reasoning of an opinion, or the result in a case, or to introduce legislation to change the law. It is quite another matter to undercut the separation of powers and the independence that the Founders created to insulate the judiciary from politics. Independent judicial review has been a crucial check on two political branches of our Government that has served us so well for more than two centuries. This bedrock principle has helped preserve our freedoms and helped make this country the model for emerging democracies around the world. 
Something that sets our Nation--the world's oldest continuing democracy--apart from virtually all others is the independence of our Federal judiciary and the respect that the public and that political leaders give it. Every fledgling democracy sends observers to the United States to study and emulate our independent judiciary, the envy of the world. The independence of our third, coequal 
branch of Government gives it the ability to fairly and impartially arbiter disputes, to prevent overreaching by the other two branches, and to defend our individual rights and freedoms that are so susceptible to the gusting political winds of the moment. 
In the 23 years that I have been privileged to serve in the U.S. Senate I have never known a time when the Senate's leadership, Republican or Democratic, would tolerate partisan and ideological politics to so divert the institution from its constitutional responsibilities to the third, coequal branch of Government. 
The Nation needs to move forward, as we did after President Eisenhower acted to restore the rule of law. The citizens of Little Rock and other cities throughout the country accepted the constitutional imperative to end segregated schools. A few years later Congress acted to pass the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1997, can anyone say that we are not a better and stronger nation for having honored the Supreme Court's Brown decision by enforcing it in Little Rock? 
The American people know that a fair and impartial judiciary is key to maintaining our democracy and our rights. The continuing partisan campaign against qualified and fair judicial nominees has to come to an end. If the judiciary is to retain its ability to protect our rights and freedoms as we move into a new century of American history, if it is to serve as a check on the political branches, it must have the judges and resources necessary to the task. Vacant courtrooms and empty benches cannot hear criminal trials, enforce our environmental protection laws, resolve legal claims or uphold the Constitution against encroachment. 
I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Judge Katherine Sweeney Hayden to be a U.S. district judge for the District of New Jersey. Judge Sweeney Hayden is a well-qualified nominee. 
Since 1991, the nominee has been a judge on the superior court in Newark, NJ. The ABA has unanimously found her to be well qualified, its top rating. She has the support of Senators Lautenberg and Torricelli. She had a confirmation hearing on June 25 and was reported by the Judiciary Committee on July 10 along with the nomination of Anthony Ishii to be a district judge in the Eastern District of California, whose nomination remains pending on the Senate Calendar. Her nomination has been held up for the last 2 1/2 months without explanation and I am glad to see it finally being brought forward. I congratulate Judge Sweeney Hayden and her family and look forward to her service on the federal court. 
I spoke on September 5 and 11 urging that this nomination and the others on the calendar be considered. There are now five other judicial nominations ready for Senate consideration. Unfortunately, they are not being taken up today and I know of no plan for them to be taken up any time soon. 
With Senate confirmation of these district judges, the Senate will still be a confirmation short of the dismal total of last year. We still have more than 40 nominees among the 68 nominations sent to the Senate by the President who are pending before the Judiciary Committee and have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. 
Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day of this session, having been renominated by the President. Several of those pending before the committee had hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago persist. The committee has 10 nominees who have been pending for more than a year, including 5 who have been pending since 1995. 
While I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with the nomination of Judge Sweeney Hayden, there is no excuse for the committee's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Prof. William A. Fletcher; Judge James A. Beaty, Jr.; Judge Richard A. Paez; Ms. M. Margaret McKeown; Ms. Ann L. Aiken; and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably reported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been passed over so far this year. Nor is there any explanation or excuse for the Senate not immediately proceeding to consider the other five judicial nominations pending on the Senate Calendar. 
The Senate continues to lag well behind the pace established by Majority Leader Dole and Chairman Hatch in the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, the Senate had 
confirmed 36 Federal judges. With today's actions, the Senate will have confirmed less than one-half that number, only 16 judges. We still face almost 100 vacancies and have 50 pending nominees to consider with more arriving each week. 
For purposes of perspective, let us also recall that by August 1992, during the last year of President Bush's term, a Democratic majority in the Senate had confirmed 53 of the 68 nominees sent to us by a Republican President. By the end of August this year, this Senate had acted on only 9 out of 61 nominees. Indeed, by the end of September in President Bush's final year in office, the Senate confirmed 59 of his 72 nominees. This Senate is on pace to confirm only 16 out of a comparable number of nominations. 
Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot try the cases and incarcerate the guilty if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day. National Public Radio has been running a series of reports all this week on the judicial crises and quoted the chief judge and U.S. attorney from San Diego earlier this week to the effect that criminal matters are being affected. 
I have spoken about the crisis being created by the vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At the rate that we are going, we are not keeping up with attrition. When we adjourned last Congress there were 64 vacancies on the federal bench. After the confirmation of 16 judges in 9 months, there has been a net increase of 32 vacancies. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the Federal judiciary.' 
The Judiciary Committee has heard testimony from second circuit, ninth circuit and 11th circuit judges about the adverse impact of vacancies on the ability of the Federal courts to do justice. The effect is seen in extended delay in the hearing and determination of cases and the frustration that litigants are forced to endure. The crushing caseload will force Federal courts to rely more and more on senior judges, visiting judges and court staff. 
Judges from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals testified, for example, that over 80 percent of its appellate court panels over the next 12 months cannot be filled by members of that court but will have to be filled by visiting judges. This is wrong. 
We ought to proceed without delay to consider the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the second circuit and move promptly to fill vacancies that are plaguing the second and ninth circuits. We need to fill the 5-year-old vacancy in the Northern District of New York and move on nominations for over 30 judicial emergency districts. 
In choosing to proceed on this nominee, the Republican leadership has chosen for at least the fourth time this month to skip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow. I, again, urge the Senate to consider the long-pending nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a district court judge for the Central District of California. 
Ms. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this year, but May 1996. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her nomination was, thus, first pending before the Senate more than 15 months ago. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown. 
She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her second confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the Judiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When she was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported with the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for more three months and has been passed over, time and again, without justification or explanation. 
What is this mystery hold all about? In spite of my repeated attempts to find out who is holding up consideration of this outstanding nominee, and why, I am at a loss. 
Ms. Morrow is a qualified nominee to the district court. I have heard no one contend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial wringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she voted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years. 
The committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert Bork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that what is required to be confirmed to the district court in this Congress? 
With respect to the issue of `judicial activism,' we have the nominee's views. She told the committee:  
The specific role of a trial judge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and courts of appeals. His or her role is not to make law. 
She also noted: 
Given the restrictions of the case and controversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems facing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job of the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional structure. 
Margaret Morrow was the first woman President of the California Bar Association and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is currently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. She is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and by Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican Administration. Representative James Rogan attended her second confirmation hearing to endorse her. 
Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. Her public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve this treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away. 
The President of the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the President of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the President of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: `Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties' and she `is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.' I could not agree more. 
Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to consider and confirm Margaret Morrow, along with Anthony Ishii, Richard Lazzara, Christina Snyder and Marjorie Rendell.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to express my dismay, actually my increasing dismay, at the direction the Federal Communications Commission is taking, the misguided deregulation of local telephone markets. 
When the Telecommunications Act was debated, and then when it was signed into law, many supporters hailed the legislation first and foremost as a boon to consumers. 
We were told that because of the magical hand of competition, telephone rates for consumers would decrease; the free market system would take over. 
Now, competition, if it is correctly injected into the telephone market, can lead to lower prices for consumers. But the FCC's ham-handed attempts to implement poor legislation--and it was poor legislation, which is why I voted against it--has made the problem even worse. 
During the debate of the telecommunications bill, I took the Senate floor and expressed real strong concerns that skyrocketing telephone rates for rural areas, like my own State of Vermont, seemed likely. I wish I had been wrong, but unfortunately my concerns seem justified. 
Even a bad telecommunications bill--and this was--could have been partially mitigated by careful and proper implementation. But the FCC seems bent on wanting to take what was a poorly done bill and make it worse. They want to exacerbate the conditions I expressed concern about during debate on the bill. 
Here is what has happened. 
Instead of increasing telephone service competition, there are three alarming FCC decisions that will in fact reduce telephone competition in rural areas and will likely result in much larger monthly telephone bills in States such as Vermont. 
The result may be that many rural customers will not be able to afford a telephone at home. The dream of linking America together on the information superhighway, a dream of linking all parts of America, urban and rural, together will remain just that, a dream, not a reality, because rural America will be cut off. 
The Telecommunications Act directed the FCC to ensure that rates for phone service in rural areas remain reasonably comparable to rates in urban areas. Now, I understand there are details being worked out, but many of the decisions already rendered by the FCC do not bode well for rural States like Vermont. 
For instance, the FCC decided the Federal universal service support would be raised only from the interstate revenues of interstate carriers. So what does that do? The FCC places off limits more than half of the retail revenue available from the telephone industry. 
Second, the FCC has ruled they would support only 25 percent of the need even in a high-cost rural State like Vermont. This leaves 75 percent of the need to be raised by the States themselves, presumably from the intrastate revenues generated in those States, in other words, to raise the largest amount from the small rural States. 
And third, they seem to repeal the high-cost support as we know it. 
Let me show you on this chart, Mr. President. This shows a likely result of the FCC's three decisions. 
This assumes the States are going to have to make up the support that the FCC now says it will not provide. Let us see what this means. The blue vertical bars show the anticipated State surcharges on intrastate revenues; that is, if they want to make up the difference. The red bars show an alternative approach, which the FCC did not adopt, where all needed support would come from a uniform Federal surcharge on all telephone revenues. 
Let me tell you what this means. If they had done what they should have done, almost all States would have paid about a 2-percent surcharge to make up the difference. That is the red line on the chart. Whether you are in the District of Columbia or North Dakota, whether you are in New Jersey or Wyoming, you will be paying roughly the same. 
However, instead of doing that, what the FCC has said, to heck with rural States. Instead of keeping a surcharge about the same for everybody, they tell North Dakota they will have to come up with about 33 percent, South Dakota about the same, Wyoming, just under 30 percent, Montana similar to that, New Mexico and Kansas up over about 12 percent. If you are a small rural State, what they are saying is forget about being part of the telecommunication revolution. If you are a small rural State, forget about being told the U.S. Congress has given you a good deal in the Telecommunications Act. You have just got a disconnect signal. In fact, you probably have to pay for that. 
Of the top 15 States, almost all rural States, they can buy with only a rate surcharge of 9 percent. That is money out of pocket. The act requires States to have reasonably comparable rates. Boy, this sounds great. You are from a rural State or from an urban State, roughly comparable rates. Who could disagree? Except what happens, if you are paying a 1- or 2-percent surcharge in one State and in another State a 30- or 35-percent surcharge, you are not roughly comparable, and there is no way these States can compete. 
Would it not have made more sense to say every State pays about 2.6, 2.5 percent surcharge? Then everybody would be on an even playing field, whether you are a company in North Dakota or in Vermont, or you are a company in Michigan or Pennsylvania, at least basic costs would remain the same. If you were a homeowner, if you were a renter, if you were in those States, your costs would be roughly comparable. 
Under the FCC's proposal, which make no sense at all, many experts predict an increase in the 100 percent to 200 percent range for phone rates in these very rural States. Now, I am one Vermonter who would not stand for that, and I cannot imagine any other Vermonter standing for that. 
I think the time will prove these unfortunate predictions correct, as rural phone companies go out of business, the bigger competitors cherry pick the best customers, and the rural areas, you might as well go back to smoke signals, Pony Express, or shouting across the valleys because you will not be able to do it by picking up the phone. 
I think the FCC is letting a golden opportunity slip by. I think, Mr. President, we may have given them the opportunity by casting rural areas over the side in that Telecommunications Act. Even tossing them over side, you would have thought the FCC would have put out a net or a helping hand. Instead, it looks like they tied the anchor around their neck as they went by and dropped them into the ocean.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, President Clinton announced that the United States would not join nearly 100 nations, including most of our NATO allies, in a treaty to ban antipersonnel landmines. 
I want to take a few minutes to respond to the President's decision. First, let me say that President Clinton and I have spoken many times about the landmine issue. I am convinced he wants to see these weapons banned from the face of the Earth. He and I have discussed the horrendous toll of innocent lives that landmines cause, and in speeches at the United Nations he has twice called for a worldwide ban. 
President Clinton said, `The United States will lead a global effort to eliminate these terrible weapons and stop the enormous loss of human life.' Those were inspiring words. However, as convinced as I am of the President's desire for a ban, I am as convinced that a tremendous opportunity was lost last week. An opportunity that rarely comes in history. 
As a USA Today editorial put it, `having blown the best chance ever to negotiate an acceptable international ban on landmines, the Clinton administration now finds itself churning in the wake of world affairs. The United States has joined a few nations, including rogue states like Iran and Iraq, on the outside of a remarkable process.' 
There are many losers in the administration's last-minute failed attempt to negotiate in Oslo. Unfortunately, the most notable losers were the innocent victims of landmines who the treaty aims to protect. Mr. President, the victims of landmines are almost invariably children and innocent civilians. 
Because while the treaty is immensely important for establishing a new norm of conduct, until the United States signs it, there will never be a worldwide ban. There is simply no substitute for the credibility and influence of the United States to bring reluctant nations on board and make sure that violators of the treaty are caught and punished. There is no way to fully stigmatize these weapons and curtail the use, as has been done with poison gas, without U.S. leadership far stronger than we have seen today. 
And the tragedy of our country's decision is that it was avoidable. Although the President said his administration had gone the extra mile to find an acceptable compromise in Oslo, I must respectfully and honestly disagree. 
Two weeks ago I went to Oslo where I met with representatives of governments, including the United States, and nongovernmental organizations that were participating in the treaty negotiations. 
The treaty they adopted was nothing short of a miracle. In less than a year, nations as diverse as our closest European allies who have been major producers of landmines, to Mozambique whose people have been killed and maimed by landmines, joined together in finalizing a treaty that does nothing less than ban the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of a category of weapons that Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman called `a violation of civilized warfare' over a century ago. 
I call the Ottawa Treaty a miracle because it was only 11 months ago that Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy launched what is now called the `Ottawa process.' At the time, no one knew how many nations would take part or where it would lead, not even Minister Axworthy. It was a bold and courageous leap of faith, and the same kind of leadership I and so many others hoped to see from the White House last week. 
The Ottawa Treaty culminates two decades of failed attempts to deal effectively with the landmine problem. Two decades ago many of the same nations that gathered in Oslo met in Geneva to draft a treaty to address the growing concerns of the effects of landmines on civilian populations. Landmines had been widely used in Southeast Asia, and they were being sown like seed in Afghanistan and Central America and many African countries. Vast areas were being laid to waste with the innocents paying the horrifying price. I have seen victims, all over the world, of these indiscriminate weapons. 
My wife is a registered nurse and has visited the hospitals where the amputations take place, where broken bodies are put back together as best can be done in countries where medical care is often rudimentary. 
That treaty, however--the Conventional Weapons Convention--utterly failed to achieve its goal. It was doomed to fail because of the fact that landmines are inherently incapable of distinguishing between civilians and combatants, and that fact was never even acknowledged in Geneva, much less addressed. Instead, in diplomatic niceties, by people who would never have to face landmines themselves, they adopted vague limits of how mines could be used. Those limits were then routinely ignored. In the years since then, the devastation inflicted by landmines on innocent people, often the poorest people in the world, has increased dramatically. In fact, Mr. President, it was the widespread 
recognition of the failure of that treaty which led to the Conventional Weapons Review Conference 2 years ago. Finally, it seemed there could no longer be any excuse for doing whatever was necessary to stop the carnage wrought by landmines. 
That was the hope. Unfortunately, the reality was a lot different. Rather than devise a roadmap for ridding the world of these weapons, governments, including our own, fought for the right to use them. The idea of a ban was barely mentioned. The amended protocol, while preferable to the original, did far more to reaffirm the legitimacy of landmines than to stop their use. Once again, governments had failed to act with anything like the decisiveness that was called for. 
So it is important to remember that the Ottawa process evolved only after years of failed attempts by governments to solve this problem in the traditional way. There was no shortage of impassioned speeches about the harm landmines were causing the innocent. But the expressions of outrage were qualified with the assertion that the problem wasn't the mines themselves, but other people, always other people, who used them irresponsibly. You would think it was a tea party rather than arms control. And the carnage, of course, continued. 
But we hear those same arguments today. The same failed arguments of a decade ago. Today when a Pentagon official was asked about the tens of thousands of American landmine casualties in Vietnam, he said that was no longer relevant because `smart' mines had `solved their problem.' 
Of course, they have not solved it. Almost no one besides the United States uses those mines. In Bosnia, more than 250 U.N. and NATO soldiers and thousands of civilians have been injured or killed today by the same types of mines used in Vietnam a generation ago. 
As I have said so many times, an effective international agreement based on stigmatizing a weapon cannot have different standards for different nations. The importance of this principle cannot be overstated. It is what underlies any international agreement. 
When the Princess of Wales spoke about the insidious toll of landmines, she said, `Before I went to Angola, I knew the facts, but the reality was a shock.' Unfortunately, the reality that Princess Diana saw was a reality which far too few government officials have experienced, including many people at the Pentagon. When people have gone with me and seen the carnage caused by landmines, they have a new understanding. 
A year ago, after the President urged all nations to complete a ban treaty `as soon as possible,' it became clear that the administration was not willing to show the kind of leadership that was necessary to turn those words into reality. 
Instead, other countries, led by Canada and hundreds of nongovernmental organizations, stepped into the void. In a matter of months we saw the number of nations participating in the Ottawa process exceed 100, including many nations that were producers and exporters and users of antipersonnel mines. 
Those nations came together determined to overcome past failures because they knew about those failures. Many had suffered the effects of landmines because of those failures. They came together to do the only thing that could solve the landmine problem--ban the types of landmines that are triggered by an innocent footstep, ban them without exception, ban them without reservation. And they wanted the United States to be part of it. When I was in Oslo I found a genuine desire to try to accommodate the United States, if it could be done without weakening the treaty. 
But the administration seriously underestimated the worldwide commitment for a ban. For months, the White House belittled the Ottawa process. Since it wasn't their idea, they refused to take it seriously. And rather than throw the weight of the United States behind Canada to help achieve something unprecedented in history, something that would have taken both courage and imagination, the administration tried to talk other governments out of taking part. 
They wasted valuable time by pursuing negotiations in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament even when it was clear that avenue was blocked. They said the United States would only give up its mines if all nations did, knowing that, like the chemical weapons treaty, there is no chance of that happening for decades. And when they finally decided at the 11th hour to go to Oslo, they went with demands that had no chance of being accepted, and little flexibility to negotiate. 
Any of the nations in Oslo that have pledged to sign the Ottawa treaty could make a stronger case to continue using these weapons than the world's only superpower. Basically, the United States went to Oslo and said: we are the most powerful Nation on earth, but we can't give up our anti-personnel mines because we have better technology, but you less powerful nations, you should give up your mines. 
Well, Mr. President, the Pentagon is, understandably, deeply reluctant to give up a weapon that has some utility--and it does--even if doing so would pressure others to end the suffering of innocent people. Like any government department, the Pentagon's job is to protect its options. It has always resisted giving up weapons, from countermanding General Pershing in the 1920's at the first Geneva convention when he wanted to ban poison gas, to nuclear testing in the 1990's. If a Pentagon official is asked what he or she needs, the answer is always `more.' More firepower might mean fewer casualties, so the Pentagon has resisted the pressure to give up antipersonnel landmines. 
The President is constantly faced with departments that do not want to cut their budget or eliminate programs. That is why he has the National Security bureaucracy, to make those hard decisions. In the case of weapons of mass destruction like nuclear and chemicals weapons, his advisers have found ways to work closely with the Pentagon to find creative solutions. 
But when issue of landmines reached the surface a year and a half ago, nobody in the administration was willing to aggressively challenge and prod the Pentagon into finding a workable solution. Without that prodding, the Joint Chiefs put far more effort into blocking the U.S. from joining the ban than into planning how to live with it--even though there were those in the Pentagon who at least were honest enough to privately point out the fallacies in the assumptions underlying the Pentagon's own arguments. 
As recently as a few weeks ago--and the Pentagon did not serve the White House well in this--White House officials were not even aware of the weaknesses in the Pentagon's doomsday predictions about the consequences of removing antipersonnel mines from Korea, or even aware of the fact that the Pentagon was, at least internally, divided over some of the same arguments they had made at the White House. 
They did not even have a thorough grasp of the treaty's provisions. Right up until the end, there were those in the administration who were unaware that the treaty effectively grants a twelve-year grace period for removing existing minefields, such as in Korea. Last week, the Secretary of Defense wrote in the Washington Post that `millions' of lives could be lost if the U.S. signed the treaty because North Korea might interpret our signing as a loss of resolve and start a war because of it. Good Lord, Mr. President. This is as bad as `the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming' scenario we heard, even as the Russian army was collapsing internally. Not only is that about that as far-fetched as any dire Pentagon prediction I have heard yet--and that includes its assessment of the Red Army that was fit to conquer the world--it could not even conquer Chechnya--it ignores the conclusion of every serious Pentagon analyst that a North Korean invasion would be destroyed, with or without antipersonnel landmines, before it could traverse 50 miles down narrow, pre-targeted mountain passes to Seoul. If antipersonnel landmines are going to determine the fate of South Korea, South Korea ought to surrender. But the fact is, South Korea has a far better trained, better equipped army, is better motivated than North Korea, and is backed by the might of the most powerful Nation on earth. A North Korean invasion would be suicidal, and they know it and everyone knows it. A former commander of our forces in Korea says scattering landmines there would impede the mobility of our own forces, and inflict casualties on our own troops. 
But it does not even matter, because the other countries in Oslo were prepared to try to accommodate U.S. concerns on Korea. 
Had the White House not waited until the last minute to get involved, a solution could have been found. In fact, many of us told them that months ago. 
Over 60 Members of the U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, including every veteran of combat in the Vietnam war, have signed onto legislation to ban antipersonnel landmines. In fact, Mr. President, the Leahy-Hagel bill would do no more than what Great Britain, Germany, South Africa, France, and a lot of other nations have already pledged to do, over the objections of some of their own armed forces. In fact, it does not go as far because it gives the President broad flexibility on Korea, which the Pentagon has called a unique situation--`the Cold War's last frontier.' The Pentagon said they need time to take care of Korea. Our legislation gives them more time than they need. 
I was encouraged by the President's statement last week that he wants to work with Congress. I welcome that, and I thank him for the kind words he spoke about my efforts. I really do believe that he wants to see a worldwide ban on landmines. I have always supported efforts to negotiate an international export ban in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament. 
But, Mr. President, the clock is ticking, and there should be no mistake. The Ottawa treaty is the only hope for achieving a comprehensive worldwide ban on these weapons. There is no other treaty. If the United States does not sign in December, we have to find a way to sign at the earliest possible time. 
That is not going to happen as long as the Pentagon pretends that a weapon it called an antipersonnel landmine a few months ago, and which the President pledged to ban a year ago, has suddenly, miraculously, overnight become no longer an antipersonnel mine if it's placed near an antitank mine. They tried that in Oslo; they tried to change the definition. It would have invited any nation in the world to use antipersonnel mines--dumb, smart, just average, or any type--indefinitely, as long as they were in the vicinity of an antitank mine. It was a terrible idea and literally a loophole big enough to fly a 747 through. 
If the use of antipersonnel mines near antitank mines is what prevents the United States from signing the treaty, then solve it. We run a little Rover around on Mars. If we can do that, we can solve this problem. If the Pentagon had spent the past three years since the President first called for a worldwide ban really trying to solve that problem rather than to keep from having to solve it, the United States might have been able to show the leadership on this issue that the world needs and, frankly, the world wants. 
This is not a public relations problem to be managed. This is not about trying to find some way to convince a focus group. It is not a question of valuing the lives of American soldiers more or less than the lives and limbs of innocent civilians. Both soldiers and civilians will benefit from a landmine ban. It is about the one nation on this planet, whose power and influence and moral authority are unmatched, the nation that I am proud to serve in the U.S. Senate. It is about this nation seizing the best opportunity there is ever going to be to deal with a problem that is needlessly plaguing so many countries. 
Staying outside this treaty is not an option. We have to be part of it, if not now, then we need to do what needs to be done to become part of it. 
I might note, Mr. President, that Japan, which like the U.S. also expressed concerns about the treaty in Oslo, is apparently reconsidering its position and may sign in Ottawa after all. I wrote to their foreign minister saying I hope they do this. It would be extremely significant, as many Asian nations look to Japan for leadership. 
President Clinton also spoke of efforts the United States is making to help other nations get rid of landmines, and to aid the victims. I join him in that. But I remind the President and the Pentagon that each of these efforts was started by the Congress. They are vitally important, and I welcome the President's announcement that he wants to expand them. But even expanding 
something like the Leahy War Victims Fund is no substitute for putting an end to the use of these weapons. 
I want the United States to show the kind of leadership that is expected of the world's leading democracy, the greatest democracy history has ever known. The United States was a founder of the League of Nations and the United Nations. We have been a leading force in every significant humanitarian law treaty and arms control treaty in history. Leadership by definition means taking risks. It means having the faith and courage to seize an opportunity that comes rarely in history and rejecting the conventional wisdom, and taking a dramatic step. 
The chemical weapons treaty would not exist had it not been for the United States taking such a step. The nuclear test ban treaty would not exist without our leadership. 
The United States showed its capacity for greatness with the Marshall Plan. We didn't say we would rebuild Europe `except for this country or that country.' We said all should benefit, including our former enemies. I am proud of what my country did then, and I want to see the same kind of leadership now. 
The Ottawa treaty will be signed in December. There is still time for the White House to reconsider. Fourteen Nobel laureates sent a letter to President Clinton last week urging him to reconsider. There is still time to aggressively engage the Pentagon on the technical issues that have prevented the President from agreeing to sign. If we do not have a plan for solving them by December, then get busy and solve them. At least commit to signing it at a future date. That is what the world needs to hear. It is the least we can do. 
Mr. President, the Ottawa treaty will set a moral standard for the next century that even those nations who do not sign will ignore at the risk of being condemned as international outlaws. It will be a tribute to those nations who recognize the urgency that this humanitarian crisis demands. The treaty ends the 20th century, the bloodiest in history, in a way in which the world can be justly proud. It is our gift to the next century. The United States should be part of it. 
I said in Oslo that my wife and I look forward, with great pleasure, to the birth of our first grandchild at the beginning of next year and, God willing, that child will live most of his or her life in the next century. My prayer is that it will be a century where armies of humanity dig up and destroy landmines and no one puts new ones down.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his consideration and listening to this long speech. While I have spoken maybe 50 times on this issue on the floor, I thought it was important to put in the Record exactly what has happened and why the United States is not on the treaty, but to also implore the President, who I feel does want to see it ban landmines, to take the steps necessary so the United States can be part of this treaty. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, the President of the United States announced that the United States would not sign the landmine treaty that was just negotiated in Oslo. This treaty is the culmination of a process begun a year ago in Ottawa, Canada, by the Foreign Minister of Canada, Lloyd Axworthy, who invited nations around the world to sign a treaty that would be a comprehensive ban on the use and the export and the manufacture and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines. 
Antipersonnel landmines are these weapons that destroy the lives--either by maiming or killing--of 26,000 people a year. There are approximately 100 million landmines in the ground of the 65 nations--or more--around the world. And more are being put down every day. As one person from one of the nations most severely impacted by landmines told me once, they clear the landmines in their country `an arm and a leg at a time.' 
Thanks to the leadership of Canada, and Minister Axworthy, this effort gained support around the world. Close to 100 nations joined together in Oslo to put the final pieces together on a comprehensive landmine treaty that would be signed in Ottawa in December. 
The United States had basically boycotted this process, preferring a much slower and less effective one in Geneva following a very traditional route, the one that showed absolutely no movement. To the administration's credit, they finally did join the process, although at the 11th hour. Unfortunately, when they went to Oslo, they went to Oslo saying that the United States would need some major changes in the treaty to accept it, that they would have to have the treaty rewritten to accommodate the United States, and that these positions were not negotiable. 
I applauded the United States for going to Oslo, but I was disappointed in the steps they took once they were there. I went to Oslo for a few days and met with many of the delegates, including the chairman of the conference. Then it became clear to me--I also spoke to the American delegation--that the United States had come with basically a take-it-or-leave-it attitude and that other countries were not going to agree. 
The President said that we had obligations in Korea that were unique to the United States. We do have special obligations in Korea. But that was not an insurmountable issue. In fact, those who went there had said almost a year before, if the United States made an effort, they would help accommodate our security interests in Korea, but the United States ignored the entire process. 
Finally, hours, literally hours before the conference was to end, the United States became engaged and said, well, we need some changes. If you will give them to us, we can sign. The first change is to have a treaty that would not take effect for 9 years, plus the 10 years as provided for in the treaty to remove existing minefields. That is 19 years from this December. We would actually be in the year 2017 before the mines would be removed. The United States asked for a 19-year period even though countries far less powerful than us were willing to act much quicker. The United States was saying that even though we are the most powerful nation on Earth, we want the ability to be able to use our antipersonnel landmines all over the world for another 9 years, and the antipersonnel mines we use near antitank mines, forever. And, lastly, of course, accommodate us on Korea. It became a bridge too far for the other nations. They said we were asking too much. They were, after all, the nations being hurt by landmines and they would go forward with the treaty with or without the United States, and that is where we now stand. 
After that, the President of the United States announced a number of steps that he is willing to take unilaterally, and I commend him for these steps because he has said that he also wants to see, as we all do, this scourge of landmines to end. 
Interestingly enough, many of the steps that he talks about are in legislation pending before the Senate--legislation sponsored by both the distinguished occupant of the chair right now and myself. So I ask this: If, indeed, the main problem the administration has is our obligations, treaty obligations, defense and national security obligations in the Korean Peninsula, especially the defense of South Korea from a country that has proven its belligerence before, North Korea, a country that has an unstable political system today, faces drought, famine, and flooding--it is amazing it could have all those going on at once. It faces the consequences of its own secrecy and belligerence. If that is our main concern, they should look at the legislation we have before the Senate, similar legislation before the House of Representatives, the Leahy-Hagel bill in the Senate, the Evans-Quinn bill in the House. 
I urge the administration, disappointing as it is that it has not joined the Ottawa process, disappointing as it is it has lost this golden opportunity, to work with the Congress, the Congress which has driven the debate in this country on banning landmines--not the executive branch--the administration should now come and work with the Congress and continue forward, because, after all, the ultimate goal is to end the scourge of landmines. There is only one way to do that, and that is for the United States to join in the Ottawa Treaty. If not in December, then in the future. We need to get there, one way or another. There is no other treaty, and without the United States, we will never see the worldwide ban we all seek. 
We are coming to the close of the bloodiest century in history. It is a century where we have seen the world torn by wars, great and small, but wars that more and more saw their greatest toll in innocent civilian populations. Whether in Rwanda, in Angola, in Bosnia, in Mozambique, in Central America, or anywhere else, it is usually the noncombatants who suffer the most. And more and more those noncombatants suffer from the scourge of landmines. 
Peace agreements are signed at some time, and someday armies march away and someday the guns grow silent, but in more and more of these countries, after that happens, landmines stay in the ground and continue killing and continue maiming long after all hostilities have otherwise ceased. Sometimes long after people can remember what they were fighting about, a child walking to school is blown apart, a farmer going with his or her animals into a field is blown apart, 
a mother, following a child down a road, is blown apart; and nobody knows who put the landmine there. They may not even remember what the war was about. But they know--that person knows--that their life is changed forever. 
We have used, now, for several years, the Leahy war victims fund. We spend $5 million of our taxpayers' money each year for artificial limbs, for men, women, and children who have been injured by landmines. 
My wife, who is a registered nurse, has gone with me to some of the clinics where we use the fund. We have seen people our age get their first wheelchairs, even though they lost their legs in wars long gone by. We have seen children who have lost half their body from a landmine. We have seen a child who went to pick up what she thought was a shiny metal toy on the side of the road and lost her face and her arm. 
Mr. President, people talk about one type of landmine versus another type of landmine. They talk about the technical capabilities of one army or another. But what is often forgotten is the face of the victims. Some of those victims may no longer even have a face. When she was alive, I told the Princess of Wales that the greatest difference she made in the battle against landmines was to focus the world's attention on the faces of the victims. Because when she visited a hospital for landmine victims, the whole world visited that hospital with her. Those victims are still there. Just because the TV camera turns off, the victims don't disappear. They are still there. Their lives are still ruined. And in the time that I have been speaking, there have been two more victims of landmines. By the time we go home tonight, there will be a dozen more victims of landmines--26,000 this year alone. 
I commend the effort begun by Canada, and Foreign Minister Axworthy. I commend those nations that came together in Oslo to sign the treaty. Not in my lifetime has there been an arms control issue that so many nations have moved so quickly on, to sign a treaty so comprehensive. Never before have so many nations responded so urgently, and so effectively, to a humanitarian problem such as this. 
I regret very much that the United States was not among those who agreed to sign the treaty. Not because we are causing the problem. Other nations never even went to Oslo. Russia, China, Pakistan, India, others, who are part of the problem, they weren't even there. And that should be noted. But the United States is the most powerful nation history has ever known. The United States could be a moral beacon. Instead, the United States said: Notwithstanding our power, we want to keep our landmines, but you less powerful nations, you should give up yours. 
We should join them. We should be willing to set an example. Not to pretend that we are giving up our landmines when in fact what we are doing is calling them by another name. Let us use the steps that we can, through congressional action, which will be taken, I am sure, because there is an ever-increasing number of Members in both parties who want to see stronger U.S. leadership. 
Let us take that step here as a nation. But then let's give guidance to the rest of the world. Let's not have Russia, China, and others stay out of the process because the United States is staying out. Let us be wholeheartedly a part of this process and put pressure on other nations to join us, until the day arrives when we do with landmines what we have done with chemical weapons, and make their use a war crime. 
Throughout this process, the U.S. position has been driven primarily by the Pentagon; not by the State Department, not by the White House. I think back to the 1920's, to the First Geneva Convention, when Gen. Blackjack Pershing, no theoretical dilettante he, said we should give up poison gas. But the Pentagon said no, not so fast, because there are some instances when it could be very helpful in protecting our troops. Fortunately, our civilian leaders understood that the humanitarian disaster that could result from using poison gas outweighed whatever military utility could be got from using it. And so over time, poison gas was stigmatized so that anyone who used it risked being branded a pariah. And it was virtually never used, even though in the Korean war, or in Vietnam, there were any number of instances when it might have been militarily advantageous. 
Today we have a similar situation, where many of our best known, most decorated generals say let's give up landmines. Again, we hear the Pentagon saying, as General Pershing heard, `No, there are instances when landmines can help us.' Of course there are. There are instances when any nation would want to use landmines. But earlier this week, 89 nations made the moral decision to put the lives of innocent people first. 
The balance of power throughout the world would still be the same as it is today. The only thing that would change is there would not be the thousands of innocent civilian casualties every single year. 
Again, my prayer for the next century is that armies of humanity remove and disarm landmines, and no armies, no armies, put any new landmines down. What greater gift could we give to those in the next century, than a world without landmines?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think it is regrettable that this week the Senate has failed to consider and confirm judges necessary to fill vacancies that are leading to a crisis in the Federal courts. Instead, this is going to be remembered as the week that the Republican leadership in the House and the Republican leadership in the Senate talked openly about seeking to intimidate--their word--to intimidate the Federal judiciary. 
I regret that any Senator or any Member of the House of either party would speak of a desire to intimidate the Federal judiciary. One of the greatest hallmarks of the United States of America is that we have an independent Federal judiciary of the highest integrity. We are the envy of the world in that respect. To hear Republican leaders in the House and the Senate talk about intimidating that Federal judiciary was disheartening. It indicates our system of government showing disrespect to the intelligence of the American people and sends a signal of shame throughout the world. 
These partisan attacks threaten the independence that the Founders created to insulate the judiciary from politics. These attacks threaten the checks and balances on the political branches of our Federal Government that have served us so well for over 200 years. These bedrock principles have helped preserve our freedoms for two centuries and has helped make this country a model for emerging democracies around the world. 
Not since Congress and the American people rejected the Court-packing scheme over 60 years ago have we faced such a threat to our third branch of Government and its ability to act as the guardian of our constitutionally guaranteed rights. 
On Sunday, Congressman DeLay of Texas was quoted in the Washington Post openly asserting that `The judges need to be intimidated.' We have heard Republicans clamor for impeachment when a judge renders a decision with which a Republican Member of the House of Representatives disagrees. We have heard demands that Congress destroy the orderly process of appellate court and Supreme Court review and, instead, assume the role of a supercourt and legislatively review and veto decisions on a case-by-case basis as it may suit Congress' passing political whim and fancy. 
We have seen proposals to amend the U.S. Constitution to eliminate the independence and tenure that the Founders understood were essential if judges were to act impartially and in the interest of justice in each case rather than worry about partisan intrigue. 
This extreme rhetoric and outlandish proposals have contributed to a poisonous atmosphere in which the Federal justice system is overloaded. We have heard testimony in the Judiciary Committee from judges around the country who fear that the quality of justice they will be able to provide in our Federal courts will be adversely affected. More and more courts around the country are being forced to rely on senior judges, retired judges, and visiting judges to hear cases. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals expects to include an outside visiting temporary judge on 80 percent--80 percent--of its panels over this year. 
Other appellate courts have had to forego oral arguments in more and more cases, and litigants, the people who are paying the bills, the taxpayers of the United States, are denied any opportunity to see the judges who are deciding their causes and to have any reassurance that judges are personally considering their arguments and concerns. Court clerks and attorney staff are being used more and more extensively in the determination of cases as judges become overburdened and backlogs grow. 
These are not the way to engender confidence in our system of justice or acceptance of the process and decisions being rendered or respect for courts and the Government. 
The chief judge of the eleventh circuit has testified about `crushing workloads.' He has noted that Federal courts are `no longer able to provide the public with the same standard of 
excellent service that [they] did in the past.' The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, has called the rising number of Federal judicial vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the Federal judiciary.' He warned at the end of 1996 that `filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.' 
The second shoe dropped on Wednesday when it was reported that the Republican leader of the Senate echoed the sentiments of Mr. DeLay and defended the idea of Republicans plotting to intimidate the Federal judiciary and said, `It sounds like a good idea to me.' I can only hope that the reports of this exchange with the majority leader of the Senate were in error. For the Republican leader in the Senate to join Republican leaders in the House in an acknowledged effort to undercut the independence and integrity of the Federal judiciary would be a sign of grave danger for the American people and would be a sign of danger for the system of government that has protected this democracy for over 200 years. 
Wednesday marked the 210th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. Rather than commemorating the principles that helped make this country great, the Republican leadership's statements this week undermined the separation of powers on which our charter is based. 
Last Congress, the Republican leadership was bent on shutting down the executive branch of the Government. I remember being on the floor of the Senate arguing against that, but they shut down the Government. The American people rose up and rejected that effort outright, as the American people should. In my State, Republicans and Democrats alike roundly condemned what was done. 
So now, these Republican forces have turned their fire on the branch of Government most protective of the people's rights but least equipped to protect itself from political attack. 
They might not be able to speak up, but I will, because this year's continuing attack on the judicial branch, the slowdown in the processing of the scores of good women and men the President has nominated to fill vacancies on the Federal courts around the country, and widespread threats of impeachment are all part of a partisan ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary. Judges cannot take the floor of the U.S. Senate and defend themselves. I will. 
I have felt privileged to serve in the U.S. Senate representing the State of Vermont for 23 years. I have served twice in the majority in the Senate and twice in the minority in the Senate. I have served with Republican and Democratic Presidents, and I have worked alongside great majority leaders, like Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole and Senator Mitchell. I have never known a time when the leadership of the Senate would tolerate partisan and ideological politics so diverting this institution from its constitutional responsibilities with respect to the third constitutionally coequal branch of Government. If Wednesday's reports are accurate, sadly the American people must know that not only is the Senate leadership allowing these efforts, it is condoning them. 
Mr. President, the United States is a great democracy, I believe the greatest democracy history has ever known. Something that sets our great country apart from virtually all others in the world is the independence of our Federal judiciary and the respect that it commands among all of us. 
Every nation in this century that has moved from a dictatorship toward democracy has sent observers to the United States. Why? To see how they can emulate our judiciary. 
Those working for democracy in countries that are still struggling to adopt democratic principles know that one thing that is holding them back, one thing that allows crime and corruption and economic breakdown, is a lack of a truly independent judiciary. They know that unless they can come close to something like our independent judiciary, they will never become truly great democracies or truly free. 
We have the greatest judicial system in the world. We are the envy of people around the world who are struggling for freedom. Independence of our third coequal branch of Government helps allow it to act fairly and impartially. 
It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches that are so easily susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment. 
This is a sad week for America because it is a week in which a campaign to intimidate Federal judges was acknowledged and condoned. 
Mr. President, I call upon the U.S. Senate to reject that effort and go forward to fulfil our constitutionally mandated duty to advise and consent on the nominations of judges that the President has sent to us. Vote them up or vote them down, but show that we are united, whatever party we belong to, in protecting the integrity and, most importantly, the independence of our Federal judiciary.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I have worked this year to bring more attention and resources to combat infectious diseases, which afflict many millions of people around the world and pose a serious public health threat to Americans both here and abroad. The scope of this problem was illustrated in a July 23 article in the New York Times, about the UNICEF 1997 `Progress of Nations' report which revealed that nearly half of the world population does not have access to basic sanitation. 
For most Americans, it is hard to fathom living without something as basic as a clean toilet. Yet over 2 million children die each year from diseases and diarrhea directly related to a lack of basic sanitation. Some of the countries with populations suffering from the worst sanitation problems, including Haiti and Cambodia, have received millions of dollars in United States and international aid. Addressing these basic needs should be a priority of our assistance programs in these countries. 
Mr. President, the United States cannot fund the infrastructure to provide clean water and sanitary sewer systems for the 3 billion people in the world who currently lack such basic necessities. That is beyond our means or responsibilities. However, we should do all we can. The developing countries themselves are investing approximately $200 billion a year on new infrastructure. The Agency for International Development is currently spending about $44 million on urban infrastructure projects in parts of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, among other regions. This has shrunk from the $150 million in loan guarantees that were available in 1993 for similar projects. 
Epidemics that spread in unsanitary living conditions can and will become threats in the United States. Both the Senate and House fiscal year 1998 Foreign Operations appropriations bills provide additional money to combat infectious diseases. I am hopeful that with these additional resources, AID, the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease Control, and other government and international agencies and private organizations involved in this effort, will be able to develop a coherent plan to expand research, provide training and medicines to public health officials, and help establish the global surveillance and response system necessary to combat these diseases.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the last 2 weeks, we have seen firsthand the threats facing our rivers. In Maryland and Virginia, rivers have been plagued with fish washing up along the banks with lesions. Although the State and Federal fish and wildlife agencies have not been able to pinpoint the cause, I think we all can assume it is linked to the health of these rivers. The President's American heritage rivers initiative was launched to identify those rivers which are facing the greatest threats and assist communities revitalize the health of their backyard resources. 
In Vermont, many of our rivers have already suffered such environmental harm that they can no longer sustain healthy fish populations. Even in Vermont's first nationally designated wilderness area, the 16,000 acre Lye Brook wilderness of the Green Mountain National Forest, streams are too toxic for fish. While the streams are remote from Vermont's population centers and industries, it stands square in the path of storms from the midwest, which carry pollutants that puff out of coal-fired power plants and cause acid rain. 
Although I would argue that Vermonters are the most environmentally aware and involved citizens in the country, they cannot take on these environmental threats alone. The American heritage rivers initiative will empower these communities to access Federal resources to help them protect, preserve and develop their river resources. This is assistance Vermonters have been asking for--assistance where the community identifies the need, where the community controls the projects and where the community decides the outcome. This program is voluntary. This program is grassroots.

Mr. LEAHY. This widespread interest in the Connecticut River would not be recognized by Senator Hutchinson's amendment. His amendment would only define the `river community' as persons who live within 10 miles of the river. The Connecticut River connects four States and supports a watershed of over 11,000 square miles. I would argue that the river community stretches throughout this watershed. 
This amendment would also give priority to those rivers based on the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Although I certainly agree that these laws should be key parts of the criteria, it overlooks the other half of the President's initiative--economic revitalization. Many of our great American rivers were once the focus of our national economy as the primary means of transportation and commerce. Much of this role has been lost, but the economic link between communities and rivers has not. The Connecticut supports a rich agriculture community, a recreation network and a renewed sportfishing industry. The economic importance should also be recognized. 
I support the President's interest in highlighting 10 rivers for revitalization and hope that the program moves along quickly to bring our communities together around their rivers. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Hutchinson amendment so that the program will not be bogged down with unnecessary delay.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Gorton for increasing funding for the Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Conservation Program from the levels provided in 1997. As a strong supporter of these programs, I am encouraged to see the Senate reverse the disheartening trend of the last few years whereby the programs had been reduced to 50 percent of the 1995 level. 
These programs are very important in Vermont, where high energy costs are a stark reality. Last year, Vermont and the entire Northeast experienced a dramatic price spike in heating fuel, twenty-five percent higher than the previous winter. These price spikes hurt all Vermonters, but low-income families carry a greater burden. Energy costs account for fourteen percent of their total income, four-times as much as the average household. The Weatherization assistance program eases this burden by helping families insulate their homes, replace inefficient heaters and ventilation systems and seal drafty windows and doors. One thing Vermont has plenty of is drafty, old houses. 
But the Weatherization assistance program is not just about keeping homes warm, it is also about keeping homes safe. The program gives priority to houses with unsafe chimneys and wiring, cracked heating systems, carbon monoxide and combustion air concerns, and faulty mechanical systems. In Vermont, this program is saving lives. Let me share one example with my colleagues. During a routine energy audit at the home of an elderly couple, the weatherization auditor found extremely high and dangerous levels of carbon monoxide being emitted from the gas cooking range. He discovered that when the power goes out, the couple puts a blanket up around the kitchen and uses the cooking range for heat. As it turns out, the couple had been suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning in the dark every time there was a power outage. Through the Weatherization program, the defective valve system was replaced to make the home easier to heat and healthier for the couple. 
Finally, the Weatherization and State Energy Conservation programs make economic sense. The Weatherization program returns $1.80 in energy savings for every $1.00 spent on weatherization activities. The average savings per home that participates in these programs is $4,000 annually. Again, these are savings for low-income families who are having to make the tough choices between heating their homes and feeding their children. These programs also benefit our economy as a whole, by creating jobs in the energy efficient technology industry and in the service sector. In Vermont, for every dollar we spend on energy efficiency, over seventy percent remains in our economy. 
I commend Chairman Gorton for his support and look forward to supporting the Senate level in conference as the minimum necessary for these critical programs. As we attempt to make our nation more energy efficient we cannot turn our backs on the programs that actually work and deliver real benefits to real people. Whether these programs are insulating the homes of the elderly, disabled or poor, or helping to reduce energy costs for our hard-pressed schools and hospitals, we need to support these effective programs. I hope that we can have a successful conference in this area.

Mr. LEAHY. I am concerned that the Community Schools Program has not been funded within the fiscal year 1998 HHS appropriations bill. The elimination of this program means the cutting of funds for grants in over 35 States, midcycle, including programs in Vermont and Pennsylvania. 
Senator Jeffords and I have been working to find an acceptable way to ensure that the Community Schools programs which work well will continue to be funded. 
I understand the fiscal constraints faced by the committee. I appreciate the willingness of the chairman to add language to this bill that would give priority funding through the high-risk youth grant program to currently running Community Schools grants that are successful. 
The program in Vermont is called CITYSCAPE. This grant has allowed Barre City to develop partnerships between the schools, the community and other key service providers to target assistance to youth who are at risk of abuse and neglect, at risk of substance abuse and at risk of teen pregnancy. The program seeks to increasing community and school connection to these youth, decrease youth violence and to decrease youth use or potential use of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we will confirm three judges this afternoon. 
I ask my colleagues to look at the chart, which indicates the shameful lack of progress of this Senate in considering judicial nominations. We still have approximately 100 judicial vacancies. When we adjourned last year there were 64 vacancies and when we began this Congress there were about 74 vacancies. We are confirming judges far slower than the vacancies are occurring through death, attrition, retirements, and so forth. Even with the three judges we are confirming today, there has been a net increase in vacancies of over 30 in the last year. In fact, vacancies on the federal courts around the country have increased by more than 50 percent over the last year. 
I ask, as I have many, many times, that the majority leader, whose caucus has held back these judges, allow them to go forward. We see what happens when we have a vote on them. It is unanimous. You keep hearing that there are concerns about these judges, and then no Senator votes against them. 
Let us bring them forward. I ask that one of the first we proceed to consider be Margaret Morrow, who seems to be held up only because she is a woman--only because she is a woman. There is no reason to hold up that judicial nomination. Let it be voted. If people do not want her, vote against her. If they want her, vote for her. But let's have a vote on this. 
We are not helping the independence--in fact, we are diminishing the independence--of the Federal judiciary. 
Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate is taking up three of the six judicial nominations from the Executive Calendar. 
I am delighted to see the Senate confirm Joseph F. Bataillon to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Nebraska. He served as deputy public defender for Douglas County, NE before entering private practice as a trial attorney in Omaha. He is supported by Senator Kerrey and Senator Hagel. The ABA found him to be qualified for this judicial appointment. Mr. Bataillon's nomination was first received by the Senate in March 1996 over 17 months ago. Unfortunately, this was one of the nominations caught up in the election year slowdown last year. I congratulate Mr. Bataillon and his family and look forward to his service on the district court. 
I am also delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Christopher F. Droney to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Connecticut. The nominee has served as U.S. Attorney in Connecticut since 1993. The ABA has unanimously found him to be qualified for this judicial appointment. With the strong support of Senator Dodd and Senator Lieberman, this nomination has moved through the Committee and now to confirmation. I congratulate Mr. Droney and his family and look forward to his service on the district court. 
Likewise, I am delighted to see the Senate moving forward to consider Janet C. Hall to be a U.S. District Judge for the same district. Since 1980, this nominee has practiced law in Hartford and prior to that she had served as a special assistant U.S. attorney and trial attorney for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. The ABA unanimously found her to be well qualified, its highest rating. This nomination also has the strong support of Senator Dodd and Senator Lieberman. I congratulate Ms. Hall and her family and look forward to her service on the district court. 
In spite of the progress we have made over the last week in confirming six judicial nominations, we still have some 40 nominees among the 65 nominations sent to the Senate by the President who are pending before the Judiciary Committee and have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. 
Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day of this session, having been renominated by the President. Several of those pending before the Committee had hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago persist. The committee has 12 nominees who have been pending for more than a year, including seven who have been pending since 1995. 
So, while I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with the longstanding nomination of Joseph Bataillon and those of Chris Droney and Janet Hall, there is no excuse for the committee's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably reported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been passed over so far this year. 
Thus, even with the increased activity of the last week in which the Senate has confirmed six nominees and raised by 67 percent the number of judges confirmed all year, we continue to lag well behind the pace established by the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, the Senate had confirmed 36 Federal judges. With today's actions, the Senate will have confirmed only 15 judges. We still face almost 100 vacancies and have 50 nominees yet to consider. 
For purposes of perspective, let us also recall that by August 1992, during the last year of the President Bush's term, a 
Democratic majority in the Senate had confirmed 53 of the 65 nominees sent to us by a Republican President. That, too, is a far cry from this year's 15 out of 65. 
Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot lock up criminals if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of emergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day. 
I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At the rate that we are going, we are not keeping up with attrition. When we adjourned last Congress there were 64 vacancies on the Federal bench. After the confirmation of 15 judges in 9 months, there has been a net increase of 33 vacancies. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' 
The Courts Subcommittee heard on Thursday afternoon from second and eighth circuit judges about the adverse impact of vacancies on the ability of the Federal courts to do justice. The effect is seen in extended delay in the hearing and determination of cases and the frustration that litigants are forced to endure. The crushing caseload will force Federal courts to rely more and more on senior judges, visiting judges and court staff. 
Judges from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals testified, for example, that over 80 percent of its appellate court panels over the next 12 months cannot be filled by members of that Court but will have to be filled by visiting judges. This is wrong. 
We ought to proceed without delay to consider the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the second circuit and move promptly to fill vacancies that are plaguing the second and ninth's circuits. We need to fill the 5-year-old vacancy in the Northern District of New York and move on nominations for judicial emergency districts. 
In choosing to proceed on these three nominees, the Republican leadership has chosen for the third time in a week to skip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow. I, again, urge the Senate to consider the long-pending nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a district court judge for the Central District of California. 
Ms. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this year but May of 1996. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her nomination was, thus, first pending before the Senate more than a year ago. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown. 
She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her second confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the judiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When she was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported with the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for more 3 months and has been passed over, time and again without explanation or justification. 
This is an outstanding nominee to the district court. She is exceptionally well qualified to be a Federal judge. I have heard no one contend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial wringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she voted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years. 
The committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert Bork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that what is required to be confirmed to the district court in this Congress? 
With respect to the issue of judicial activism, we have the nominee's views. She told the committee: `The specific role of a trial judge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals. His or her role is not to `make law.' She also noted: `Given the restrictions of the case and controversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems facing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job of the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional structure.' 
Margaret Morrow was the first woman president of the California Bar Association and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is currently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. She is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and by Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration. Representative James Rogan attended her second confirmation hearing to endorse her. 
Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. Her public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve this treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away. The president of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the President of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the President of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association, and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: `Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties' and she `is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.' I could not agree more. 
Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to consider and confirm Margaret Morrow, along with Anthony Ishii and Katherine Hayden Sweeney to be district court judges.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, A question has been raised about statistics. I would point out that during President Bush's last year, with the Democrats in the control of the Senate, by August we had confirmed 53 of the 65 nominees sent to us by the Republican President, notwithstanding the `Thurmond rule' which calls for a slowdown in confirmations during a Presidential year--53 out of 65. 
In this the first year of President Clinton's second term, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 9 out of 61 judicial nominees sent by the President to the Senate by August. So the relevant statistical comparison is 53 out of 65 when Democrats were helping Republicans, but when Republicans are in control and there is a Democratic President, only 9 out of 61. 
I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished senior Senator from California.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the majority leader has moved the nomination of Robert C. Chambers to be a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Mr. Chambers has the strong support of Senator Robert C. Byrd and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV. Mr. Chambers has been engaged in the private practice of law for almost 20 years and served as a delegate in the West Virginia House of Delegates, chairman of that body's judiciary committee, and speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. The ABA found him to be qualified and the Judiciary Committee unanimously reported this nomination to the Senate in July. 
I congratulate Mr. Chambers and his family and look forward to his service on the Federal court. 
As I noted yesterday, we have a good deal of work ahead of us if we are to fulfill our responsibilities and confirm the other fine nominees who are pending before us and are needed in the Federal courts around the country. I commend the majority leader for returning to the Executive Calendar today to take up this judicial nomination.

Mr. LEAHY. I am encouraged that the Senate is taking up two of the nine judicial nominations on the Executive Calendar. 
I am delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Judge Frank M. Hull to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Since 1994, the nominee has been a United States district judge for the Northern District of Georgia and prior to that she was a judge for the Superior Court of Fulton, County in Georgia. The ABA has unanimously found her to be well-qualified, its top rating. With the strong support of Senator Coverdell and Senator Cleland, this nomination has moved expeditiously through the committee and is being confirmed by the Senate. I congratulate Judge Hull and her family and look forward to her service on the Court of Appeals. 
I am also delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Judge Henry Harold Kennedy, Jr. to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia. Since 1979, the nominee has been an associate judge for the District of Columbia and prior to that he was a U.S. magistrate. The ABA has unanimously found him to be well-qualified, its top rating. With the strong support of Senator Thurmond and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, this nomination has moved expeditiously through the committee and is being confirmed by the Senate. I congratulate Judge Kennedy and his family and look forward to his service on the district court. 
With these confirmations the Senate will raise to 11 the number of Federal judges confirmed this year and exceed, for the first time this year, the snail-like pace of confirming one judge per month. The Senate pace will rise to an anemic 1.2 judges per month. Meanwhile, vacancies have continued to mount and the delays in filling vacancies continue to grow. 
It is discouraging to once again have to call attention to the fact that of the 61 nominations sent to the Senate by the President some 40 nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee--nominees who have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day of this session, having been renominated by the President after having been held up during last year's partisan stall. 
The committee has not yet worked through the backlog of nominees left pending from last year. Several of those pending before the committee had hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago persist. The committee has 12 nominees who have been pending without action for more than a year, including 7 who have been pending since 1995. 
There is no excuse for the committee's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been reported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been passed over so far this year. 
We continue to fall farther and farther behind the pace established by the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, Senator Hatch had held 8 confirmation hearings involving 36 judicial nominees, and the Senate had proceeded to confirm 35 Federal judges. 
Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot lock up criminals if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the emergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day. 
I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the 103 vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At the rate that we are currently going this year, more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of greater numbers of Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. We are not even keeping up with attrition. 
Chief Justice Rehnquist has repeatedly acknowledged the crisis being posed for the Federal judiciary and, I believe, for all Americans. The Chief Justice has called the rising number of vacancies `the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.' The Courts Subcommittee heard on Thursday afternoon from judges from the second and eighth circuits about the adverse impact of vacancies on the ability of the Federal courts to do justice. The effect is seen in extended delay in the hearing and determination of cases and the frustration that litigants are forced to endure. The crushing caseload will force Federal courts to rely more and more on senior judges, visiting judges and court staff. 
The Attorney General spoke recently about the `vacancy crisis that has left so many Americans waiting for justice' noting that vacancies are up at a time that filings are up, caseloads are increasing, backlogs are increasing, and we are experiencing an `unprecedented slowdown in the confirmation process' that has `very real and very detrimental impacts on all parts of our justice system. She spoke about the hundreds of appellate arguments being canceled, the Federal judges who go for entire years without hearing a single civil case. She said: `Quite simply without enough judges, our laws will become empty promises and `swift justice' will become an oxymoron, and without the independence they need to uphold those laws, our judges will become hostages to politics instead of being the guardians of our principles.' 
In July I received a copy of a letter sent to President Clinton and the Republican leader of the Senate by seven presidents of national legal associations. These presidents note the `looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial positions' and the `injustice of this situation for all of society.' They point to `[d]angerously crowded dockets, suspended civil case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, overburdened judges, and chronically undermanned courts' as circumstances that `undermine our democracy and respect for the supremacy of law.' I agree with these distinguished leaders that we must without further delay `devote the time and resources necessary to expedite the selection and confirmation process for federal judicial nominees.' The President is doing his part, having sent us 61 nominations so far this year with more on the way. The Senate should start doing its part. 
In choosing to proceed on these two nominees, the Republican leadership has chosen once again to skip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow and to delay action on six other outstanding nominees who were reported at the same time as those fortunate enough to be selected for consideration by the Senate this week. 
I want to turn briefly to the long-pending nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a district court judge for the Central District of California. Ms. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this year but May 1966. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her nomination was, thus, first pending before the Senate more than a year ago. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown. 
She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her second confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the Judiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When she was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported with the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for more 3 months and has been passed over, again. 
This is an outstanding nominee to the District Court. She is exceptionally well qualified to be a Federal judge. I have heard no one contend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial ringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she voted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years. 
She has been forced to respond to questions about particular judicial decisions. I find this especially ironic in light of the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire in which we ask whether anyone involved in the process of selecting the nominee discussed with her `any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as asking how you would rule on such case, issue, or question.' We try to ensure that the administration imposes no litmus tests and does not ask about specific cases. 
The committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert Bork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that what is required to be confirmed to the district court in this Congress? 
With respect to the issue of `judicial activism,' we have the nominee's views. She told the committee: `The specific role of a trial judge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals. His or her role is not to `make law.' She also noted: `Given the restrictions of the case and controversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems facing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job of the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional structure.' 
Margaret Morrow was the first woman president of the California Bar Association and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is currently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. She is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and by Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration. Representative James Rogan attended her second confirmation hearing to endorse her. 
Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. Her public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve this treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away from government service. 
The president of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the president of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: `Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties' and she `is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.' I could not agree more. 
Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to consider and confirm Margaret Morrow, along with Anthony Ishii, Katherine Hayden Sweeney, Robert F. Droney, Janet C. Hall, Joseph F. Bataillon, and Robert C. Chambers to be district court judges.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor with the senior Senator from Utah this resolution that designates September 6, 1997, as a National Day of Recognition for the Humanitarian Efforts of Diana, Princess of Wales. 
What we try to do with this resolution is to convey a sense of the tremendous sorrow that Americans--indeed, people around the world--felt at the shocking news of her death in Paris. 
I was with my wife in Vermont, and was called out of a gathering to be given the preliminary news of the accident. The two of us went back to our home that evening praying that the injuries were not life threatening. Of course, within a matter of hours we learned that she had died. 
We have all been moved by the outpouring of affection by people everywhere, who remember the Princess of Wales as an extraordinary humanitarian who gave voice to the most vulnerable people. I remember the conversations I had with her about the scourge of landmines. This was an issue that I was honored to work with her on. She and Elizabeth Dole, the wife of our former distinguished majority leader and President of the American Red Cross, and myself and others, held a fundraiser for the victims of landmines earlier this year, and 
raised over half a million dollars for people who had lost arms and legs or their eyesight from landmines. She could do that, by simply spending an evening talking about the plight of landmine victims. She said about her trip to Angola, `Before I went to Angola, I knew the facts but the reality was a shock.' I wish more people would go see what she saw, and walk where she walked. Landmines would be banned tomorrow. 
A lot of us can give speeches about landmines. Many people around the world have worked to stop the scourge of landmines, but Diana brought a human face to the crusade to ban them. She gave a voice to landmine victims. When she visited them, in Angola, or Bosnia, the whole world saw those victims. When she held in her arms a child maimed by a landmine, the whole world saw that child. And when they saw her walk into a minefield, the whole world saw the danger so many people face every day. 
There was never a question in my mind, in my conversations with her, about the sincerity of her compassion. She saw the victims of landmines through the eyes of a mother, a mother who cared not only for her own two sons, but for the sons and daughters of those dying worldwide. 
This week and next week nations of the world meet in Oslo to take the final steps toward an international treaty banning landmines. I hope each of them will think of what this woman did, in calling attention to the victims of landmines. There would be no more fitting memorial to this great woman than a treaty that bans anti-personnel landmines from this Earth forever. 
I thank my distinguished colleague. I have appreciated working with him on this. He spoke about the many other humanitarian causes the Princess was involved in. I mentioned landmines, of course, because I saw first-hand how she became involved not as a Princess but as a mother, a mother who knew how other mothers suffered when their children suffered. She spoke for all of us. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire, and I intend to work with him in a bipartisan manner to promote land conservation by pushing forward the recommendations made by the Northern Forest Lands Council in 1994. As highlighted in S. 552, the Forestland Preservation Tax Act, certain tax polices work against the long-term ownership and management of forestland and instead force landowners to sell or change the use of their land. H.R. 2014 begins to address this program with the provisions for conservation easements and estate tax relief for small businesses and family farms. In the Northeast, the timber production is part of our agriculture and faces many of the same challenges as family farms.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a very special Vermonter. Peter Jennison has devoted much of his life to documenting our wonderful State. 
Among his many accomplishments, Peter has authored `Vermont: An Explorer's Guide,' `Roadside History of Vermont,' numerous Vermont magazine articles and reviews, and also `Vermont on $500 A Day (More Or Less)'--and for those of you who are lucky enough to have visited Vermont you understand the tongue-in-cheek title of the last book. 
His skill and talent for writing and history earned him the Vermont Book Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. As someone who has enjoyed many of his books and magazine articles, I know that this award is well deserved. 
Peter is a longtime special friend of mine as is his wife Jane and I wanted the Senate to know about them. 
The Rutland Herald recently ran an excellent piece on Peter Jennison. I ask unanimous consent that the article appear immediately following my statement. 
From the Rutland Daily Herald, July 10, 1997  
A `Born Again Vermonter' Reflects on A Life Spent Among Books  
At 75 nothing shocks Peter S. Jennison except the prices of books and hotels. 
`I can remember when a suite at the Plaza cost $10 a day,' he said with a chuckle on the morning of his big birthday, July 2 was celebrated quietly, followed by a family gathering at the weekend. Jane Jennison, his wife of 51 years, was cheerful but bedridden with emphysema, knee surgery and two hip replacements. Otherwise life appeared to be going tolerably well in the 1840 brick cottage on the hill above the Taftsville General Store. 
Jennison, a `born again' Vermonter, who grew up in Swanton and then lived many years in New York only to return home again, is probably best known to the average reader as one of the authors of `Vermont: An Explorer's Guide' and the popular `Roadside History of Vermont.' 
Others may recognize him as the dry, accurate and often humorous reviewer of restaurants and inns for Vermont Magazine. Or you may have seen his books in libraries, including two novels set in Vermont, `The Governor,' written in 1964, and `The Mimosa Smokers,' and a semi-serious guidebook called `Vermont on $500 A Day (More or Less).' Two of his other books, `History of Woodstock, 1890-1983,' and `Frederick Billings,' written with Jane Curtis and Frank Lieberman, reflect his historian side and his lifelong interest in Vermont history. 
An affable observant man known for his quiet wit, Jennison and his wife, Jane, founded Countryman Press, (now a part of the giant W.W. Norton Publishing Company), in Woodstock in 1973. Or re-founded, you might say. The Jennisons revived the imprint, dormant since the 1930s, which had in the past published such greats as Stephen Vincent Benet and Edgar Lee Masters, and launched their own version, including a new, colophon designed by Vermont artist Sabra Field. 
Success came quickly, although it was hard work. Peter and Jane worked from their kitchen table to produce Countryman's first book, a guidebook called `Wonderful Woodstock.' and only three years later published its first bestseller, `Backyard Livestock,' by Steven Thomas, a book that is still selling well today. By this time several veteran editors and marketing people had joined the little enterprise, among them, the late Keith Jennison, Peter's brother, author of the humorous `Yup * * * Nope and Other Vermont Dialogues', and three men who would eventually run the company, Louis Kannenstine, Christopher Lloyd and Carl Taylor. 
The idea was to pay careful attention to the selection of books, be willing to take a chance on a writer; and to take pride in the way their books were designed. Said Jennison at the time, `Working this way is * * * a much more personal kind of publishing that is possible elsewhere in the conglomerate scene.' It was a philosophy which saw little Countryman become a David among the Goliaths. 
`Countryman was like a woodstove. You had to keep adding logs. Bit by bit we grew beyond our expectations. We didn't have a master plan, it just happened. The more books, the more momentum,' Jennison said. 
The company operated from the Jennisons' home for the first four years. Editing, billing and shipping continued to get done at the kitchen table. Books were ferried to bookstores in the back of a Toyota pickup truck. Next, Countryman moved down the hill near the Taftsville General Store, where it stayed until 1981 when it relocated to Woodstock and constructed its own building on Route 4. Countryman Press operated there until 1994. After the sale to W.W. Norton, the staff relocated to Mt. Tom. The building is presently for sale for $495,000. 
Selling to a big New York City publisher was `an emotional wrench, like selling the family farm, but I realized we had, so to speak, survived the childhood and the adolescence of the company, and now we had grown up and got married,' said Jennison philosophically. 
`For a small publisher it was getting more and more complicated and expensive to do business. The big wholesalers and the chains are now dictating the rules of the game,' he added. 
`Publishing has gotten to be part of the entertainment industry. More people are buying more books, but because of the star system that dominates the industry, a lot of new writers are being deprived of an audience. There are still a lot of smaller presses, but they don't have access to the major markets,' Jennison said. 
Another factor is the reliance of the big players on computers and the industry's fixation on the bottom line. 
`Unfortunately the buyers at Barnes and Noble and at Ingram (the largest book distribution company in the U.S.) are ruled by their computer records; how well an author sold before, what type of book sold before, etc. I call it the Bill Gates-is-God mentality,' he said. 
Jennison, however, remains hopeful, `I am optimistic enough to think there will always be a large number of people who would rather curl up with a book than a computer game. The format of the book will be with us for a long time. It'll go on,' he said. 
In 1996 the Vermont Book Publishers Association awarded Jennison a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to publishing. 
A sixth-generation Vermonter, born on a dairy farm in Swanton, north of St. Albans, Jennison attended a one room school until his parents packed him off to Philips Academy, Andover. Next came Middlebury College, interrupted in his junior year by World War II. Jennison served three years with the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, as a code and ciphers specialist, decoding messages from U.S. agents behind the lines in Germany, France and Norway, Returning to Middlebury, he graduated with a degree in American literature, married Jane, and began what was to become a lifetime spent with books. 
Jennison worked first for `Publishers Weekly' as a reviews editor and feature writer, and then went on to become Assistant Director of the American Book Publishers Council. In the 1960s, he served on the National Book Committee, a non-profit citizens group promoting books and libraries, similar to the Vermont Center for the Book, but on a national scale. Under the auspices of the Ford Foundation he also worked with fledgling publishing companies in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, as well as serving on the panel for the National Book Awards. 
`The Natinal Book Awards weren't as high profile in the sixties. We got a lot of local publicity, though, outside of New York. Now, it's more like the Academy Awards,' said Jennison. 
The Jennisons returned to Vermont in 1971. I'd had enough of New York and I was tired of being held hostage by the New Haven Railroad,' recalled Jennison, referring to his years as a commuter from suburban Westport, Conn. 
Christina Tree, co-author of `Vermont: An Explorer's Guide,' remembers the story a little differently. `The way I heard it, Peter came home one night after a hard day in the city, wound up like a clock, and accidentally walked straight off the patio into the family swimming pool, seersucker suit, briefcase and all. He got out, sputtering, and yelled, `That does it. Jane, we're going back to Vermont.' 
Although he is now officially retired, Jennison continues to write for `Vermont Magazine' and will work again with Tree on the next edition of `Vermont: An Explorer's Guide.' 
Countryman Press's `The Explorer's Guide series' started in 1979. The first book was about Massachusetts, the home state of Tree, a young travel writer at the Boston Globe. Said Tree from her home in Cambridge, `Peter hired me to write the series. I wrote one on Massachusetts and one on Maine. But the year I was to begin the one on Vermont, I had some family difficulties, and Peter so-authored to help me out.' 
The partnership was such a success the two have continued co-writing the book ever since. 
`We divided up the state,' said Jennison. `Now, when it's time for a new edition, we switch sections and re-visit old places and add new ones.' 
The guidebook is published every two years and has garnered much praise for its accuracy and attention to historical detail. The most recent edition came out in May, which means that come the summer of 1998, Jennison and Tree will again switch their sections and start trekking for the 1999 edition. Working off the previous edition on their computers, the pair will meticulously re-check each entry, changing phone numbers and prices where necessary adding names or dropping them. 
Said Christina Tree, `The depth of Peter's knowledge of Vermont is huge. He's seen tremendous changes in the state, and he's got an interesting perspective, returning to Vermont at the time he did, after being away for so long. He personifies a certain kind of aristocratic Vermonter, who's very sophisticated and also very active and involved. He's low-key and witty and generous. And of course he's a fabulous writer. Somebody ought to do an oral biography of him.'

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we adjourn until September, I once again note my dissatisfaction with the lack of progress we have made in confirming the many fine women and men whom President Clinton has nominated to the federal judiciary. 
This year the Senate has confirmed only 9 federal judges before the August recess during a period of 108 vacancies. Thus, when the Senate returns in September it will remain on the snail-like pace that the Republican leadership has maintained throughout the year of confirming one judge per month. Meanwhile, vacancies have continued to mount and the delays in filling vacancies continue to grow. 
It is discouraging to once again have to call attention to the fact that some 40 nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee--nominees who have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day of this session, having been re-nominated by the President after having been held up during last year's partisan stall. Thus, the Committee has not yet worked through the backlog of nominees left pending from last year. Several of those pending before the Committee had hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were nominated as long as 27 months ago persist. 
Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot lock up criminals if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the emergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day. 
I was delighted when the Senate moved promptly on the nomination of Alan Gold before the July recess, but his is the only nomination that has been confirmed promptly all year. There is no excuse for the Senate's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been reported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been passed over so far this year. 
We continue to fall farther and farther behind the pace established by the 104th Congress. By this time two years ago, Senator Hatch had held seven confirmation hearings involving 31 judicial nominees, and the Senate had proceeded to confirm 26 federal judges. The record this year does not compare: Four hearings instead of seven; nine judges confirmed instead of 26. 
I recently received a copy of a letter dated July 14, 1997, sent to President Clinton and the Republican Leader of the Senate by seven presidents of national legal associations. These presidents note the `looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial positions" and the `injustice of this situation for all of society.' They point to `[d]angerously crowded dockets, suspended civil case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, overburdened judges, and chronically undermanned courts' as circumstances that `undermine our democracy and respect for the supremacy of law.' I agree with these distinguished leaders that we must without further delay `devote the time and resources necessary to expedite the selection and confirmation process for federal judicial nominees.' The President is doing his part, having sent us 14 nominations in the last two days. The Senate should start doing its part. 
I want to turn briefly to the long pending nomination of Ms. Margaret Morrow to be a District Court Judge for the Central District of California. Mr. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this year but May of 1966. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her nomination was, thus, first pending before the Senate more than a year ago. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown. 
She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her second confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the Judiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When she was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported with the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for more than six weeks and has been passed over, again, as the Senate is about to adjourn for a month-long recess. 
This is an outstanding nominee to the District Court. She is exceptionally well qualified to be a Federal judge. I have heard no one contend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial ringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she voted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years. 
She has told the Committee: 
I support citizen initiatives, and believe they are an important aspect of our democratic form of government. The 1988 article was not meant to be critical of citizen initiatives, but of the lack of procedures designed to eliminate confusion and make clear and relevant information about initiatives available to voters. I was trying to suggest ways in which the initiative process could be strengthened, by communicating more information to the electorate about the substance of initiative measures and by eliminating drafting errors that form the basis for a legal challenge. I believe it important for citizens to obtain as much information as possible respecting any matter on which they cast a vote. 
I believe the citizen initiative process is clearly constitutional. I also recognize and support the doctrine established in case law that initiative measures are presumptively constitutional, and strongly agree with [the] statement that initiative measures that are constitutional and properly drafted should not be overturned or enjoined by the courts. 
In passing on the legality of initiative measures, judges should apply the law, not substitute their personal opinion of matters of public policy for the opinion of the electorate. 
My goal was not to eliminate the need for initiatives. Rather, I was proposing ways to strengthen the initiative process by making it more efficient and less costly, so that it could better serve the purpose for which it was originally intended. At the same time, I was suggesting measures to increase the Legislature's willingness to address issues of concern to ordinary citizens regardless of the views of special interests or campaign contributors. I do not believe these goals are inconsistent. 
. . . . The reasons that led Governor Johnson to create the initiative process in 1911 are still valid today, and it remains an important aspect of our democratic form of government. 
Does this sound like someone who is anti-democratic? No objective evaluation of the record can yield the conclusion that she is anti-initiative. No fair reading of her statements suggests a basis for any such assertion. 
She has been forced to respond to questions about particular judicial decisions. I find this especially ironic is light of the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire in which we ask whether anyone involved in the process of selecting the nominee discussed with her `any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as asking how you would rule on such case, issue, or question.' We try to ensure that the Administration imposes no litmus tests and does not ask about specific cases--and then some on the Judiciary Committee turn around and do exactly that. 
The Committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert Bork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that what is required to be confirmed to the District Court in this Congress? 
With respect to the issue of `judicial activism,' we have the nominee's views. She told the Committee: `The specific role of a trial judge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals. His or her role is not to `make law.' She also noted: `Given the restrictions of the case and controversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems facing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job of the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional structure.' 
I am appalled at the treatment that Margaret Morrow has received before the Senate and have spoken about her on the Senate floor on many occasions. It is long past time for the Senate to take up this nomination, debate it and vote on it. In my view, the Senate should certainly have done so before adjourning for a month-long recess. 
Margaret Morrow was the first woman President of the California Bar Association and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is currently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. She is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and by Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican Administration. Representative James Rogan attended her second confirmation hearing to endorse her. 
Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. Her public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve this treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away from government service. 
The President of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the President of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the President of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: `Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties' and she `is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.' I could not agree more. 
Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to confirm Margaret Morrow.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Eric L. Clay to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Clay is a well-qualified nominee. 
The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on May 22, 1997. The sixth circuit desperately needs Eric Clay to help manage its growing backlog of cases. In fact, the sixth circuit has three vacancies, two of which have been designated judicial emergencies by the Judicial Conference of the United States. 
We first received Eric Clay's nomination in March 1996. He was accorded a hearing in the last Congress on March 26, 1996, and was reported by Judiciary Committee to the full Senate on April 25, 1996. Unfortunately, his nomination was never acted upon because of the Presidential election year slowdown of judicial confirmations in 1996. 
The President renominated Eric Clay on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the sixth circuit, which vacancy has existed since September 1994. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies that we should have filled last year. This vacancy has persisted for more than 2 1/2 years. He has the support of both Senators from Michigan, a Republican and a Democrat. He had a confirmation hearing on May 7 and the committee considered and unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate 2 weeks later. This important nomination was held without action on the Senate Executive Calendar for over 2 months by the Republican leadership. 
I am delighted for Mr. Clay and his family that his nomination is finally being confirmed and am confident that he will make a fine member of the sixth circuit.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Majority Leader has decided to take up the nomination of Arthur Gajarsa to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit. Mr. Gajarsa is a well-qualified nominee. 
The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on May 22, 1997. The Federal Circuit desperately needs Arthur Gajarsa to help manage its growing backlog of cases. 
We first received Arthur Gajarsa's nomination in April 1996. He was accorded a hearing in the last Congress on June 25, 1996, and was unanimously reported by Judiciary Committee to the full Senate 2 days later. Unfortunately, his nomination was never acted upon because of the Presidential election year shutdown of judicial confirmations in 1996. 
The President renominated Arthur Gajarsa on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the Federal Circuit, which vacancy has existed since November 1995. This vacancy has persisted for more than 1 1/2 years. He has the support of both Senators from Maryland. He had a confirmation hearing on May 7 and the Committee considered and unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate 2 weeks later. This nomination has been pending on the Senate Calendar since May 22. Apparently, after these 2 months on the Senate Executive Calendar without action or any explanation for its inaction, the Republican leadership is prepared to allow the Senate to approve this nomination. 
I am delighted for Mr. Gajarsa and his family that he is finally being confirmed. He will make a fine judge.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Thomas W. Thrash, Jr., to be a United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia. Mr. Thrash is a well-qualified nominee. 
The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on May 22, 1997. The Northern District of Georgia Sixth Circuit desperately needs Thomas Thrash to help manage its growing backlog of cases. 
We first received Thomas Thrash's nomination in May 1996. He was accorded a hearing last Congress on July 31, 1996, but his nomination fell victim to the Presidential election year confirmation shutdown of 1996. The President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, which vacancy has existed since March 1996. He had a confirmation hearing on May 7 where he was supported by both Senator Cleland and Senator Coverdell and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks later. This is another of the nominations that has languished on the Senate Executive Calendar since long before the July 4 recess. I am glad that the Republican leadership has allowed this nomination to go forward. I congratulate Mr. Thrash and his family on his confirmation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the leader will yield further. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I commend the distinguished majority leader, the Democratic leader, and the chairman and ranking member of that committee for pushing us this far on the appropriations. It is highly commendable. 
I join my friend from Maryland in saying there are many of these nominations on the calendar that need to be cleared as soon as possible--especially the judges that are there. We have new vacancies in our courts. Again, once a person has been confirmed, it still takes weeks before they get out of whatever life they are in--private practice, or whatever--to get out of that and get set up and get their law clerks hired, and on and on, and with all that it means with their families and lives and all. So if some can be cleared now, we know it will be 5 weeks sooner.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the successful adoption by the World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO] of two new copyright treaties--one on written material and one on sound recordings--in Geneva last December was appropriately lauded in the United States. The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty will give a significant boost to the protection of intellectual property rights around the world, and stand to benefit important American creative industries--from movies, recordings, computer software and many other copyrighted materials that are subject to piracy on-line. 
According to Secretary Daley of the Department of Commerce, for the most part, `the treaties largely incorporate intellectual property norms that are already part of U.S. law.' What the treaties will do is give American owners of copyrighted material an important tool to protect their intellectual property in those countries that become a party to the treaties. With an ever-expanding global marketplace, such international protection is critical to protect American companies and, ultimately, American jobs and the U.S. economy. 
Over the past few months, I spoke and wrote to Secretary Daley urging him to transmit without delay the administration's proposal for implementing legislation. I am very pleased that earlier this week, the administration did so. The legislative package we received is an excellent start for moving forward, and I commend the administration, Secretary Daley and, in particular, Assistant Secretary Bruce Lehman of the Patent and Trademark Office for their hard work on this proposal. 
I am glad to introduce this legislation, with Senator Hatch, on behalf of the administration. I hope we will take this matter up for hearings and further deliberation and action promptly after the recess. 
In sum, this bill makes certain technical changes to conform our copyright laws to the treaties and substantive amendments to comply with two new Treaty obligations. Specifically, the treaties oblige the signatories to provide legal protections against circumvention of technological measures used by copyright owners to protect their works, and against violations of the integrity of copyright management information [CMI], which identifies a work, its author, the copyright owners and any information about the terms and conditions of use of the work. The bill adds a new chapter to U.S. copyright law to implement the anti-circumvention and CMI provisions, along with corresponding civil and criminal penalties. 
Technological developments, such as the development of the Internet and remote computer information data bases, are leading to important advancements in accessibility and affordability of art, literature, music, film and information and services for all Americans. As Vinton Cerf, the coinventor of the computer networking protocol for the Internet, recently stated in The New York Times: 
The Internet is now perhaps the most global and democratic form of communications. No other medium can so easily render outdated our traditional distinctions among localities, regions and nations. 
We see opportunities to break through barriers previously facing those living in rural settings and those with physical disabilities. Democratic values can be served by making more information and services available. 
These methods of distribution also dramatically affect the role of copyright. Properly balancing copyright interests to encourage and reward creativity, while serving the needs of public access to works, can be a challenge. The public interest requires the consideration and balancing of such interests. In the area of creative rights that balance has rested on encouraging creativity by ensuring rights that reward it while encouraging its public performance, distribution and display. 
I was glad to have played a role in the development and enactment of the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recording Act, Public Law 104-39. That legislation served in many respects as the precursor to the WIPO Treaty on performance rights adopted last December. Performance rights for sound recordings is an issue that has been in dispute for over 20 years. I was delighted in 1995 when we were finally able to enact a U.S. law establishing that right. 
I believe that musicians, singers and featured performers on recordings ought to be compensated like other creative artists for the public performances of works that they create and that we all enjoy. I wanted companies that export American music not to be disadvantaged internationally by the lack of U.S. recognition of such a performance right. Most of all, I wanted to be sure that our laws be fair to all parties--to performers, musicians, songwriters, music publishers, performing rights societies, emerging companies expanding new technologies, and, in particular, consumers and the public. 
I am glad to have been able to play a role in redesigning the performance right in sound recording law to meet these objectives. Our substitute, which was ultimately enacted, preserved existing rights, encouraged the development of new technologies, and promoted competition as the best protection for consumers. Working with Senator Thurmond, then chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and with the help of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, we were able to strengthen the bill in significant regard. I was pleased to cosponsor the substitute and to work for its passage. 
I have also been supportive of copyright protection and anticircumvention legislation over the past several years and been working on ways to utilize copyright management information to protect and inform consumers. 
I anticipate that at Judiciary Committee hearings on this important measure, we will examine the impact of the treaties and this implementing legislation, both domestically and internationally, on the careful balance we always strive to maintain between the authors' interest in protection along with the public's interest in the accessibility of information. 
Ours is a time of unprecedented challenge to copyright protection. Copyright has been the engine that has traditionally converted the energy of artistic creativity into publicly available arts and entertainment. Historically, the Government's role has been to encourage creativity and innovation by protecting copyrights that create incentives for the dissemination to the public of new works and forms of expression. That is the tradition which I intend to continue.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment applies to only a few States that have been found liable for violations of civil rights or constitutional rights of prisoners in their prisons before enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are about 35 special masters supervising prison conditions that might be affected by this amendment, although the Administrative Office of the Courts expects that number to be reduced to 28 by October 1. 
Why should Congress and Federal taxpayers be required to bail out these few States for their poor prison conditions, unconstitutional treatment, and history of noncompliance with their own consent decrees? 
The Congressional Budget Office and Administrative Office of the Courts estimate that this amendment will cost the Federal Treasury about $3 million this year. Why should U.S. taxpayers bail out a few States for one of the costs of bringing their state prison conditions up to constitutional standards? Will we next be asked to pay for the other remedial aspects of the decrees that have been agreed to by State officials? If States want flexibility to use some of the billions of dollars for prisons that the Federal Government has made available to the States since passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to help defray these costs and expenses, I would support that. 
This amendment raise constitutional concerns because it retroactively and statutorily seeks to overturn consent decrees where States have agreed to foot the bill for a special master to monitor their poor prison conditions and implementing remedies to bring them up to constitutional standards. Why should Congress overturn decrees already agreed to by the States involved in these lawsuits over poor prison conditions? Why should Congress intervene when these matters are already being reviewed by newly assigned judges in these cases? 
The Prison Litigation Reform Act, which was included in last year's omnibus spending bill, has been construed by the courts not to be retroactive in order for it not to be held unconstitutional. This amendment crosses that line and seeks to extend certain questionable provisions of that law back in time and have them apply to cases that it was not designed or intended to cover. It will lead to additional constitutional challenges. 
This amendment would bail out a few States by taking money from the Federal Judiciary's administrative account. That account pays for improvements in computers in courtrooms, teleconferencing, and other services that make the administration of justice more effective and efficient. Why are we taking money away from improving the administration of justice to bail out these few States?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate that Human Rights Watch, the International Labor Rights Fund, and Mexico's National Association of Democratic Lawyers have asked the U.S. National Administrative Office [U.S. NAO] to investigate reports of widespread pregnancy-based sex discrimination in Mexico's maquiladora industry. 
These organizations report that maquiladoras routinely administer pregnancy exams to prospective female employees in order to deny them work, in blatant violation of their privacy. Female employees face invasive questions about contraceptive use, sexual activity, and menses schedules. In some cases, women who become pregnant after being hired are forced to resign. Maquiladora owners fear that pregnant women will reduce production standards and that legally mandated maternity benefits will drain industry money. The report concludes that the Mexican Government has failed to investigate these discriminatory practices in violation of their own laws and NAFTA. 
The request for an investigation is the first of its kind that has been brought before the U.S. NAO. The case represents an important opportunity to convey to our trading partners and United States corporations who have operations in Mexico that sex discrimination is intolerable, illegal, and in violation of NAFTA. 
As we consider expanding NAFTA benefits to the Caribbean Basin and other South American countries, the United States should demonstrate to our trading partners that we take labor rights violations seriously. I hope the U.S. NAO will consider this case expeditiously and I look forward to its report. The priviledge of free trade and its economic benefits should be conditional upon the trading partners abiding by the same labor and environmental laws.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, during National Crime Victim Rights Week, I said that it was important to focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims not just during that week of special ceremonies, but throughout the year. I am, therefore, pleased to have this opportunity to introduce legislation with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. Our Crime Victims Assistance Act represents the next step in our continuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of crime. 
My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago when I served as State's attorney for Chittenden County, VT, and witnessed first hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized. 
I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past 15 years, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have included: 
The Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982; The Victims of Crime Act of 1984; The Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act; and The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996. 
Just this March, Congress passed the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997, which I cosponsored with Senators Nickles, Inhofe and Hatch. That legislation reversed a presumption against crime victims observing the fact phase of a trial if they were likely to provide testimony during the sentencing phase of that trial. 
As a result of that legislation, not only were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing able to observe the trial of Timothy McVeigh, all those who were able to witness the trial and were called as witnesses to provide victim impact testimony at the sentencing phase of that trial were able to do so. 
Also, on the first day of this session, we introduced S.15, a youth crime bill. In that legislation, which we have identified as a legislative priority for the entire Democratic caucus, we included provisions 
for victims of juvenile crime so that their rights to appear, to be heard, and to be informed would be protected. Those provisions have now been incorporated in the juvenile crime bill ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee last week along with added protections against witness intimidation. 
The legislation that we introduce today, the Crime Victims Assistance Act, builds upon this progress. It provides for a wholesale reform of the Federal rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. Particularly, the legislation would provide crime victims with an enhanced: right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention; right to be heard on plea bargains; right to a speedy trial; right to be present in the courtroom throughout a trial; right to give a statement at sentencing; right to be heard on probation revocation; and 
Right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison. 
The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that are currently before Congress by including: Enhanced penalties for witness intimidation; an increase in Federal victim assistance personnel; enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and officers of the court; the development of state-of-the-art systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases; and the establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims. 
These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year with a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not overcome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to amend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of implementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of crime victims. 
I look forward to continuing to work with the administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges, and other interested parties on how we can most effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and State legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights over the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make additional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights that crime victims deserve. 
In my State, Vermont, there are many individuals who have made a difference by dedicating themselves to serving the needs of crime victims. Individuals, such as Lori Hayes from the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services, have joined in leading the Nation on issues pertaining to crime victims. I congratulate Lori on the results of the Justice Department's recent site visit of Vermont's Victims of Crime Act programs. The Justice Department concluded that  
Vermont's programs are setting the standard for outreach to under served populations and service coordination among providers and allied professionals * * * Other States interested in improving their services and advocacy for crime victims would do well to study the model created by Lori Hayes, her staff, and other victims advocates in Vermont. 
Without the commitment of people like Lori, we would not be making the progress that we are. 
I would like to acknowledge several others who have been extremely helpful with regards to the legislation that we are introducing today: The Office for Victims of Crime at the Justice Department, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the NOW Legal Defense Fund, the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women, Professor Lynne Henderson from Indiana Law School, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, the National Victim Center, and many others. 
While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs and made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have more to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue will join Senator Kennedy and me in advancing this important legislation through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now, and I hope Congress will make it a top priority and pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act before the end of the year.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been on the Appropriations Committee for 20-some odd years, on the Judiciary Committee about the same amount of time, and I understand that periodically, out of necessity, we have some items of legislation on the appropriations. But this is about as amazing a step as we could take to determine the fate of the ninth circuit on an appropriations bill. 
It is not the way to do it. We say we are going to split the Nation's largest court of appeals on this appropriations bill. We have had no hearings, no testimony, no public deliberations on the proposed split before us. 
Well, the 45 million people that live in these nine Western States deserve a more considered approach. What we ought to do is have the Senate Judiciary Committee hold hearings, conduct an independent study to determine whether this or any other proposed circuit division is necessary, find out what is the best way to do it, and not just do it basically based on one vote with very little debate in a committee, then on the floor in an appropriations bill. 
Last year, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to create a bipartisan commission to study if and how the ninth circuit should be restructured. And that is what the House has done this year. The amendment of the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], is the same language as H.R. 908, the House-passed bill. 
What the Senator from California has done is a principled approach. It is also the approach supported by the majority of the judges and lawyers in the areas served. 
Are there problems in the ninth circuit? Of course there are. Let me point out to you, it is a problem not caused by the circuit, but by the U.S. Senate; 9 of the 28 judgeships in the ninth circuit are vacant. There are nominees up here before the Senate. 
As a result, the national average is 315 days to get a decision, but for the ninth circuit, it is 429 days. We have people in the ninth circuit who pay taxes like everybody else but who have to wait an extra 114 days. In fact, the ninth circuit canceled 600 hearings this year because we cannot get judges confirmed to sit there. 
And what does that mean? It means that a multimillion-dollar settlement of a nationwide consumer class action against a maker of alleged defective minivans is not heard; a $71.7 million antitrust case involving the monopolizing of photocopy markets is not there; an arsenic and lead poisoning class action case with a $68 million settlement agreement is not being heard. 
What is happening, Mr. President, is that we go on and try to do little quick fixes because somebody wants to at the moment on an appropriations bill. 
What we ought to do, if we want to really do something to help justice in this country, is for the leadership of the Senate, that is, those who schedule debate, in this case, the majority leader, to take some of these judges and allow us to confirm them. 
The distinguished senior Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is on the floor. He has been working hard to get judges heard. But no matter how many we hear in the Judiciary Committee, unless they are confirmed on the floor of the Senate, it does not do any good. 
At this point, incidentally, we have confirmed--and we are down to the seventh month of this session--we have confirmed six judges. We are about to take another vacation. No more judges will be confirmed. That is less than one a month. 
There are over 100 vacancies. We have about 40 or so nominees up here waiting to be confirmed. We cannot even get them confirmed. Here is one, William Fletcher, nominated in 1995; still waiting. Richard Paez, the first month of 1996; still waiting. Margaret McKeown, March 1996; still waiting. This goes on and on and on. 
Here is what we have in vacancies--102 vacancies. This Senate has confirmed six. 
We all give speeches of needing judicial reform and needing law and order. You have a whole lot of courts where, because the U.S. Senate, because the leadership of the U.S. Senate will not let us confirm judges, we have courts where prosecutors have to kick cases out, that they have to plea bargain and everything else because there are not enough judges to hear them. 
Now, when you have proponents of the split of the ninth circuit say it is because justice is being denied, the reason justice is being denied is not geography; the real reason justice is being denied is because judges are being delayed. 
These are four well-qualified in the ninth circuit, four well-qualified people. In fact, they have the highest ratings there are. One nominee has actually been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee, but no--no--action here. 
What is happening, Mr. President, is not something that is going to get fixed by the Judiciary Committee, but is going to get fixed if the U.S. Senate does the duty it is supposed to. If we have judges here people do not like, vote them down. We held up the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, week after week. `Oh, we've got Senators, we cannot tell you their names, of course, but we have Senators who have real problems, real problems with this man. We can't bring him to a vote. We've got real problems.' 
We brought it to a vote. I asked for a rollcall vote. I thought, well, at least let all those Senators, unnamed Senators, who had an excuse for holding the No. 2 law enforcement officer of this country--I said, now we will know who they are, because, obviously, they have problems that they would hold up this man all these months, so they will vote against him. And the clerk called the roll. 
And do you know what it was? You know how many voted against him? You say, maybe 30? Probably 20, 10, I ask my good friend, the ranking member? You know how many it was?

Mr. LEAHY. Zero. I cannot quite say it--I cannot quite say it like my good friend from South Carolina. He is the only person I know who can get five syllables in the word `zero,' but zero. It was 100 to nothing; 100 to nothing. 
But what we have is, while the Judicial Conference, Chief Justice Rehnquist was asking for more justices, we have 27 vacancies in the court of appeals. We have all kinds of problems. And the ninth circuit is not going to be helped by politicizing it on an appropriations bill. 
The ninth circuit can at least be helped by doing what the Senator from California said, have a nonpartisan professional panel look, make a recommendation, go to the Senate Judiciary Committee, vote it up or down, which is exactly what we should be doing on these judges. If we do not want them, vote them down. 
But what we have is always some mysterious person who has a problem. But when we have to vote in the light of day, there is no mysterious person at all because they vote for them. So, Mr. President, I know there are others who wish to speak.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to highlight a program in my State which I believe is a model the Small Business Administration [SBA] should consider investing in. Small businesses are the driving force of Vermont's economy. An important reason for their success in the State has been the development of a healthy export market for the goods they produce. Forty percent of Vermont companies, employing some 70,000 Vermonters, are engaged in some degree of export trade. In 1995, Vermont created and funded the Vermont World Trade Office [WTO] to provide technical assistance to Vermont businesses and information on foreign trade opportunities. The office has been overwhelmed by requests from companies interested in exploring trade opportunities. To meet that demand and make the office more convenient to Vermont businesses, the WTO hopes to open satellite offices in other parts of the State, expand services and offer additional seminars for interested businesses. Funding from the SBA would make this expansion possible. I believe that a modest investment by SBA would yield a valuable demonstration of the importance of export assistance in building and expanding markets for small businesses. Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree that this would be an appropriate use of SBA funding?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Chairman Gregg and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary recognize in the Report for S. 1022 that the `pace of technological change in the telecommunications industry poses enormous challenge' both to law enforcement and national security agencies in conducting court-authorized wiretaps and `in the conduct of foreign counterintelligence and terrorism investigations in the United States.' The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA], which I sponsored in the 103d Congress, addressed this public safety and national security problem, after considerable debate and hearings in the Judiciary Committees of both the House and the Senate. I commend the chairman and the subcommittee for recognizing `that digital telephony is a top law enforcement priority.' 
CALEA authorizes $500 million for the Attorney General to pay telecommunications carriers for costs associated with modifying the embedded base of equipment, services, and facilities to comply with CALEA. Nevertheless, S. 1022 does not include any funding for this law, based upon the Committee's finding `that the Bureau has adequate resources available.' 
Moreover, the report recommends that no funds be expended for CALEA until the following requirements are met: First, the Bureau creates a working group with industry officials approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and second, the working group develops a new `more rational, reasonable, and cost-effective CALEA implementation plan' that is satisfactory to the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
Would Chairman Gregg agree with me that in addition to the Appropriations Committees, the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate, which authorized CALEA, should also be involved in approving the industry officials on the working group and any plan provided by the working group?

Mr. LEAHY. This addresses one of the concerns I have with the report's new requirements for expenditures of money for CALEA implementation. 
I am also concerned about whether creation of the working group tasked with developing a CALEA implementation plan will delay, rather than facilitate, implementation of this law and compliance by telecommunications carriers with the four law enforcement requirements enumerated in this important law. Indeed, the report places no time constraints on creation of this working group or on when the Bureau-working group implementation plan must be submitted to the specified committees. 
Further delay in implementation of CALEA poses risks for the effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies. As the committee acknowledges, they are already encountering problems in executing court-authorized wiretaps. The industry, with the input of law enforcement, has drafted a specifications standard for CALEA. I am concerned that objections from the Bureau over elements in that proposed standard are delaying its adoption. I would like to see the Bureau accept that standard and get on with CALEA implementation. 
I am also concerned that the working group proposed by the committee will work behind closed doors, without the accountability that CALEA intended. We should make sure that any meetings of the working group will be open to privacy advocates and other interested parties. 
I fully appreciate that questions have been raised about how the implementation of CALEA is proceeding. That is why, over a year ago, Senator Specter and I asked the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a diverse coalition of industry, privacy and government reform organizations, for its views on implementation of CALEA, and other matters. We circulated to our colleagues on June 20, 1997, a copy of this group's `Interim Report: Communications Privacy in the Digital Age.' The report recommends that hearings be held to examine implementation of CALEA, how the Bureau intends to spend CALEA funds, and the viability of CALEA's compliance dates. This recommendation is a good one. 
We should air these significant questions at an open hearing before the authorizing Committees. I would rather see the authorizing Committees work in that fashion with the Appropriations Committees to make funds immediately available and insure those funds are spent to establish a minimum standard that serves law enforcement's pressing needs, without some of the enhancements being proposed by the FBI that industry claims are delaying the process of implementation. The committees should insist on some priorities in terms of geographic need and capability. I think we could resolve this with a little oversight, and return to the spirit of reasonableness that characterize the drafting of CALEA.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to again focus as I did yesterday on the study of the Northeast dairy compact that will be contained in the appropriations bill as it winds its way through conference with the House and then comes back to the Senate. 
Under the Senate proposal, the Director of OMB will do a study on dairy, retail store, wholesale, and processor pricing in New England. 
As I mentioned yesterday, many Senators are very concerned that when the price that farmers get for their milk drops that the retail price--the consumer price--often does not drop. Study after study shows this result. 
Wholesale or retail stores appear to be simply making more profits at the expense of farmers. This is one of the issues OMB should examine. 
But it is very important that OMB not just give us numbers. It will not be helpful to Congress, and will be misleading, if OMB just says, for example, that the average price of milk in stores during the first 6 months of the compact was a certain amount higher than some earlier amount. 
It will not assist decision makers at all if OMB then simply multiplies that difference by the number of gallons bought by persons on Food Stamps and concludes that the product of the multiplication is the `harm' to the food stamp program. 
It is important for OMB to put the information in context or they shouldn't even do the study. I do not want information that I cannot use in deciding on legislative options. 
To continue with the food stamp example, if the cuts in the welfare reform bill enacted last year are 10 times, or 20 times, or 30 times more--not 30 percent more, but 30 times more--than any impact of the compact then perhaps the best legislative solution is to reduce the welfare reform cuts by one-thirtieth rather than dealing with the compact since the compact has positive benefits. 
It will be extremely important, from a policy perspective, to make these types of comparisons. Also note, I do not think that any increase that shows up in retail stores is justifiable under the compact after such a huge decrease in farm prices. But, if OMB assumes some we should know if the national system of milk marketing orders, or if store profits, dwarfs the impact of the compact. This will help us with policy decisions. 
A 1991 study by GAO showed a huge variation in regional pricing of milk in retail stores. Just those variations may far exceed any impact of the compact. We need OMB to look at these issues. 
Without this more detailed analysis we will only be able to announce numbers on the Senate floor to support positions, but we will not be able to use the OMB study to come to good policy conclusions. 
In addition, the purchase of fluid milk represents only a small fraction of total food expenditures. One study showed that fluid milk represents 3 percent of total food expenditures of the typical family. If use of discount coupons for a variety of foods, or the purchase of store brands, or shopping at less expensive stores dwarf the impacts of the compact, that should also be analyzed. 
It makes a big difference if the impact of the compact is equivalent to one-fourth of 1 percent of a family's food purchasing power versus, let's say, 5 percent of the family's food purchasing power. 
I also want OMB to look at the drop in food purchasing power, adjusted for inflation, that will be caused by full implementation of the welfare reform bill for our lower income households. Food stamp families live below the poverty level and these comparisons will be helpful for possible legislative solutions. 
You should also look at whether some stores price dairy products to increase their profits when they already have a reasonable return on milk. Are the profit margins on dairy products higher, or lower, than for other items? Do the profit margins far exceed any potential impact of the compact? Or are they less? 
It will be interesting and very helpful to see how milk prices change during the entire duration of the compact. There are news reports that some retailers are taking unfair advantage of the compact. If this is accurate, these effects should be temporary as the normal competitive forces take over. It is important to note that economists who have analyzed the compact determined that over time it could lower consumer prices by stabilizing the price that stores pay for milk. 
Many reports show that stores build in an extra margin to protect against increases in milk costs since it is costly to routinely change prices. If no extra margins are required it is very likely that competitive forces would lead stores to reduce those extra margins. 
Researchers such as Henry Kinnucan, Olan Forker, Andrew Novakovic, Brandon Hansen, William Hahn and others have looked at how price volatility at the wholesale level can result in increases in consumer prices for milk higher than would have occurred had wholesale prices been stable. In the New England area I am told some stores sell gallons of milk for $1.99 and some sell them for $3.29--that is a large difference and none of the difference goes to farmers. 
OMB should look at that difference to help us with our policy decisions. That could, indeed, be a major contribution to better understanding the impact of the compact, or milk marketing orders, or retail store pricing--how can such a difference exist? 
It is my view that the compact over time can reduce that need for extra margins since stores will not have to build in that cushion to protect against feared higher prices. And many economic studies support that point. My view is that no increase should have occurred especially after the major drop in milk prices to farmers starting late last year. I want to touch on one more issue. The statutory language talks of the direct and indirect effects of the compact. 
I am a strong supporter of the compact and believe it has very positive indirect effects in addition to stabilizing the price of milk. The Secretary of Agriculture has also addressed these positive indirect effects. 
I have detailed these effects in correspondence to the Secretary of Agriculture and will provide these to OMB at a later date. 
I want to mention again a point I raised yesterday. The prices farmers get for their milk dropped substantially last November nationwide. They dropped quickly, and have stayed low for months. 
It amounted to a 35-cent to 40-cent drop on a per gallon basis. Yet retail stores did not lower their prices to consumers except by a few pennies. This pricing practice for milk is well documented in the research and in the press. 
Does this failure to drop prices by 35 cents, or even just 25 cents, a gallon have a major impact on consumers? 
Will it be more than any hypothetical impact on consumers of the 
compact? In many areas of the country there is now a $1.40/gallon difference between the raw milk price--which farmers get--and the retail price of milk. Is that justified? 
OMB should look at what that difference represents in terms of profits for transporters, stores, and wholesalers. 
The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the value of milk for farmers plunged by 22 percent since October 1996--but that no comparative decline occurred in the price of milk. Another point I made yesterday was that the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have exposed retail store overcharging for milk. This should be examined. 
Farmers got one-fifth less for their milk, and someone, I presume, made a bundle. Some studies show that the dairy case is now the most profitable part of a supermarket. This should be carefully examined since most families consider milk a necessity. 
Also, the time period that OMB examines may completely determine their conclusions. Something this important should not be determined by the luck of the draw. 
In this regard, under the compact, farmers in New England are getting less for their milk than the average price they got for their milk last year. 
It will be important for OMB to look at all the factors which affect the price of fluid milk including farm prices, labor, transportation, milk marketing orders, retail profits, co-op returns, marketing strategies, feed costs, farm expenses, and wholesaler profits. 
I want to also quote from a letter that I sent to the Secretary regarding the compact relating to the indirect benefits of the compact. 
You should note that a lack of farm income resulting from low dairy prices is cited as the major reason dairy farmers leave farming in New England. Production costs in New England are much higher than in other areas of the Nation while the value of the land for nonfarm purposes is often greater than its value as farmland. 
This is very different as compared to vast areas of the Midwest and Upper Midwest where land is sometimes worth little except for its value as farmland. As the Vermont Economy Newsletter reported in July 1994:  
In the all important dairy industry, the decrease in farm income has come from a continuation of the long term trends the industry has been facing. Should these trends persist, and there is every expectation they will, Vermont will continue to see dairy farms disappearing from its landscape during the 1990's. 
One of the consequences of the exit of dairy farmers in New England is that land is released from agriculture. Given the close proximity to population centers and recreational areas in New England, good land is in high demand, and as a result there is often a strong incentive to develop the land. 
What are the consequences of land being converted from farm to nonfarm uses? 
One consequence is that the rural heritage and aesthetic qualities of the working landscape are lost forever. The impact of this loss would be devastating to Vermont and to much of New England. The tourists from some of America's largest urban centers are drawn to rural New England because of its beauty, its farms and valleys, and picturesque roads. 
Strip malls and condominiums do not have the same appeal to vacationers. 
The Vermont Partnership for Economic Progress, noted in its 1993 report, `Plan for a Decade of Progress: Actions for Vermont's Economy,' 
There are many issues that will influence the [tourism] industry's future in Vermont . . . including our state's ability to preserve its landscape. 
The report went on to list among its primary goals: Maintain the existing amount of land in agriculture and related uses; and preserve the family farm as part of our economic base and as an integral factor in Vermont's quality of life. This is taken from `A Plan for a Decade of Progress.' 
The priority of these goals show that preserving farmland and a viable agriculture industry are important for the overall economic health of the region from Maine, to rural parts of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, to Vermont and New Hampshire. 
Other consequences of farm losses are equally destructive. The American Farmland Trust has completed cost of community services studies in four New England towns, one in Connecticut and three in Massachusetts. 
These studies show the cost of providing community services for farmland and developed land. It is true that developed land brings in more tax revenues than farmland, especially when farmland is assessed at its agricultural value, as it is in most New England States. Developed land, however, requires far more in the way of services than the tax revenues it returns to the treasuries of municipalities. 
For example, residential land in these four New England towns required $1.11 in services for every $1 in tax revenue generated while the farmland required only $0.34 of services for every $1 of revenue it generated. This demonstrates the major impact that losing dairy farmland has on rural New England. 
National Geographic recently detailed the risk of economic death by strip malling otherwise tourist-drawing farmland. New England should be allowed to try to reverse this trend--especially in ways that help neighboring States such as under the compact. 
The American Farmland Trust Study pointed out that agricultural land actually enhanced the value of surrounding lands in addition to sustaining important economic uses. 
Farming is a cost effective, private way to protect open space and the quality of life. It also supports a profusion of other interests, including: hunting, fishing, recreation, tourism, historic preservation, floodplain, and wetland protection. `Does Farmland Protection Pay?' is the name of that study. 
Keeping land in agriculture and protecting it from development is vitally important for all of New England which is one reason all six New England States have funded or authorized purchase of agricultural conservation easement programs to help protect farmland permanently. Unlike much of the Midwest, for example, once farms go out of business, the land is converted and is lost forever for agricultural purposes. 
Other economic uses, from condominiums and second homes for retired or professional people from New York, Boston, or Philadelphia to shopping malls to serve them, are waiting in the wings. The pressure to develop in New England is voracious. 
A 1993 report from the American Farmland Trust called `Farming on the Edge' showed that only 14 of the more than 67 counties in New England, were not significantly influenced by urban areas. 
In fact, eight New England counties were considered to be farming areas in the greatest danger of being lost to development because of their high productivity and close proximity to urban areas. The Champlain and Hudson River Valleys were considered to be among the top 12 threatened agricultural areas in the entire country according to this study. `Farming on the Edge' is the name of that study. 
As we go to Conference I will further explore the goals and intent behind this language.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Senators who worked very hard in working this matter out. I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, my good friend, the senior Senator from Mississippi, for his efforts and, of course, the senior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for his efforts. 
I thank the members of my staff who worked so hard, and my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. And, of course, Senator Grams and Senator Feingold, from Wisconsin, who as a Member of the Judiciary Committee, while involved in a very difficult markup today, also spent a great deal of time in trying to work out this matter of great concern to his dairy farmers, as it is the other Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. 
We have worked out an understanding regarding a study of the Northeast Dairy Compact and regarding milk pricing practices as they effect consumers. 
The Director of OMB will do a study on dairy, retail store, wholesaler and processor pricing in New England. 
Many Senators are very concerned, and I have not found one who is not, that when the price that farmers get for their milk drops that the retail price--the consumer price--often does not drop. 
Wholesalers or retail stores appear to be simply making more profits at the expense of farmers. 
This is one issue we are very interested in. 
Also, the price of milk in New England, in the South, in the Midwest, and in the West is supported by a variety of milk marketing orders. These have a tremendous impact on the price of milk in retail stores, and these marketing orders will continue to exist for years to come. 
The Northeast Dairy Compact will exist for only about 18 months--it terminates in 1999, or when the Secretary reforms the milk marketing order system, whichever comes first as provided in the farm bill. 
I want to remind everyone that the compact was first approved by each of the six legislative bodies in New England, and signed into law by each of their Governors. 
So the impact on retail prices of the milk marketing order system, the impact on prices of wholesaler and retail profits, the impact on prices of the dairy compact, among other factors will be examined by the Director. 
The prices farmers get for their milk dropped substantially last November nationwide. They dropped quickly, and have stayed low for months. 
It amounted to a 35 cent to 40 cent drop on a per gallon basis. That is a huge drop for farmers. Yet retail stores did not lower their prices to consumers except by a few pennies. 
Prices that farmers got stayed low, and prices paid by consumers stayed high. 
How did the stores make out during this big price drop to farmers? There has been a major increase in retail store profits for milk. 
In some areas of the country there is now a $1.40 per gallon difference between the raw milk price--which farmers get--and the retail price of milk. 
Now that stores took advantage of that price drop to lock in huge profit margins for milk are they going to give consumers a break? Of course not. 
The Compact Commission did its job. They picked a fair return for farmers that is lower than the average price last year for milk. 
Let me repeat that: under the Compact farmers in 
New England are getting less for their milk than the average price they got for their milk last year. 
Because retail stores now have huge built-in profit margins on milk there should be no increases in price under the compact--yet retail stores are not satisfied. 
The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have exposed this retail store overcharging for milk. 
The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the value of milk for farmers plunged by 22 percent since October of 1996--but that no comparative decline occurred in the retail price of milk. 
Farmers got one-fifth less for their milk, and stores made a bundle. The dairy case is now the most profitable part of a supermarket. 
The last time I asked GAO to look at store profits for milk I was amazed at what they discovered. 
GAO found then, and its the same now, that when farm prices collapse that retail milk prices to consumers stay high. 
The failure of stores to lower prices may have had a significant adverse impact on nutrition programs. Also, I know from newspaper accounts that one chainstore in Maine dropped the price of a gallon of skim milk by one penny after the compact was implemented. Other stores reacted differently even though they enjoyed the benefit of a major price drop which I previously discussed. We need to know if stores unfairly increased prices by taking advantage of the compact even though they did not have to increase prices at all. 
I thank my good friend from Minnesota for the courtesy of letting me take this time, and my friend from Minnesota, Mr. Grams. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern that funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions [CDFI] Fund has not been included in the VA/HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
The CDFI Fund is an economic development initiative that was adopted with overwhelming bipartisan support several years ago. The program is an important investment tool for economically distressed communities. Overall, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski have done an excellent job of producing a bill which makes the most of the limited funding available. However, by not funding CDFI, I believe the committee has missed the opportunity to make a substantial and cost-effective investment in our distressed communities. 
CDFI leverages private investment to stretch every Federal dollar. The VA/HUD appropriations bill reported by the House Appropriations Committee includes the $125 million requested by the President for this valuable program. Senator Mikulski has discussed her intention to revisit the issue of CDFI funding in conference. I too believe the CDFI Program deserves the opportunity to demonstrate its effectiveness in bringing economic development resources to distressed communities. I look forward to working with Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond during conference to restore funding for this program.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the report is finally available for S. 507, The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 17 to 1 in favor of a Hatch-Leahy substitute to this bill on May 22. I urge all Members to take the time to learn about this legislation, which is designed to assist American innovation. 
The Omnibus Patent Act would reform the U.S. patent system in important ways. The bill would: 
Reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; 
Slash redtape in the Patent and Trademark Office; 
Increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and 
Facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and commercialization of inventions. 
In Vermont, we have a wide variety of independent inventors and small companies. It is especially important to me that this bill help them as well as larger, more specialized firms. I have spoken with independent inventors and representatives of smaller companies to learn what reforms they recommended. I have tried to ensure that their recommendations were incorporated into the Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment that was reported by the Judiciary Committee. 
I am especially gratified that the Hatch-Leahy substitute responds to the concerns of independent inventors and small businesses concerning the matter of 18-month publication. These concerns were articulated at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing by the president of the Vermont Inventors Association, Bill Parker. Mr. Parker suggested giving applicants who only file in the United States a choice whether or not to publish early. He also recommended that we enhance the protections granted to those who choose 18-month publication if we wish to encourage them to take that course. 
The substitute does both of these things. In particular, it allows any applicant to avoid publication before the granting of the patent simply by making such a request upon filing the application and by certifying that the application has not--and will not--be published abroad. The substitute also provides for the issuance of patents on individual claims in published applications as they are approved, rather than waiting for the disposition of all claims contained in such an application, as now occurs. This allows applicants to gain full patent protection--including reasonable royalties, damages, and attorneys fees when appropriate--for some of their component inventions earlier than they would have under the original draft of the bill. 
I was also concerned that, as introduced, the bill did not adequately protect an applicant who is diligently prosecuting a patent but whose application takes more than 3 years to process. The ability to have a full 17 years of patent protection is important to small and large patent applicants alike. The Hatch-Leahy substitute makes clear than a applicant who diligently prosecutes a patent application before the PTO should receive a full 17 years of patent protection. 
Another matter of special importance to me is the section I suggested be added in the Hatch-Leahy substitute to enhance access to patent information. I have long thought that electronic access should be more widespread, and I want to work with the Patent and Trademark Office to ensure the effective implementation of statewide electronic accessibility of patent information in rural Sates and eventually in all areas to make it easier for inventors to study prior art and make further advances. This should be of particular benefit to Vermont, which is only now getting a patent and trademark depository library. 
Although the goal of the reexamination provisions--reducing legal bills for patent applicants--was laudable, I was concerned that the legislation protect again harassment by third parties. The Hatch-Leahy substitute enhances protection against harassment by strengthening the estoppel provisions, to prevent a party from raising an issue that was raised or could have been raised in one forum from raising it in some other forum thereafter. In this way, the reexamination provision in the Hatch-Leahy substitute will provide an alternative to the current costly and time-consuming process of Federal litigation and, at the same time, protect patent applicants against undue harassment. 
I am also glad that the substitute amendment clarifies that it is not the Senate Judiciary Committee's intent to undercut the Copyright Office in any way. The Copyright Office has served this country well for over a hundred years, and it should continue in that role. 
Vermont has a great tradition of `Yankee ingenuity.' In fact, the very first U.S. patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins, a native of Pittsford, VT, who discovered a process for making potash. Today's inventors can be much like the inventors of Thomas Jefferson's day--individuals in a shop, garage, or home lab. They can also be teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at our colleges and universities. Our Nation's patent laws should be fair to American innovators of all kinds--independent inventors, small businesses, venture capitalists, and larger corporations. To maintain America's preeminence in the realm of technology, which dates back to the birth of this republic, we need to modernize our patent system and patent office. Our inventors know this and that is why they support this legislation. 
I am delighted that our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has joined as a cosponsor of this important legislation. I urge the Republican leadership to proceed to Senate consideration of S. 507 without delay.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to seek clarification on report language which the subcommittee was good enough to include in the Treasury and general government appropriations bill. That report language urges the Internal Revenue Service to approve a waiver from internal hiring requirements for the Newport IRS office if a planned reduction in force [RIF] does not result in those positions being filled. 
The Newport IRS office is one of two national centers that process SS 8 forms and has earned a high reputation for efficiency and excellence. To handle its increased responsibilities, the office has been trying to fill a number of lower level positions ranging from GS 3-5. Current IRS regulations require that these positions be filled internally. While Newport is a beautiful Vermont town, it is also extremely remote, and the office has been unable to fill such low-level positions from within the existing IRS personnel. These new personnel are needed to continue Newport's exemplary record in processing SS 8 forms. 
The committee report also includes a provision, which I strongly support, directing the IRS to continue to delay its planned field reduction in force until it submits another report to Congress with a detailed plan on how the IRS will ensure adequate taxpayer service in the future, especially in rural areas. I share the concerns outlined in the committee report about how taxpayer service will be affected by the planned reorganization, especially in rural areas like Vermont. As a result of this language, the RIF which IRS had planned for July 7 will not be going forward. My understanding is that in the absence of this RIF, the committee intends for IRS to move forward immediately with its approval for the Newport hiring waiver. Is that correct?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf of Senator Kyl and myself, the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997. This bill would close a significant loophole in our copyright law and remove a significant hurdle in the Government's ability to bring criminal charges in certain cases of willful copyright infringement. By insuring better protection of the creative works available online, this bill will also encourage the continued growth of the Internet and our national information infrastructure. 
This bill reflects the recommendations and hard work of the Department of Justice, which worked with me to introduce a version of this legislation in the 104th Congress. I want to commend the Department for recognizing the need for action on this important problem. This bill was noted with approval in the September, 1995 `Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights,' chaired by Bruce Lehman, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, and has been cited by the Business Software Alliance as one of its major legislative priorities. 
For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law a defendant's willful copyright infringement must be `for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.' Not-for-profit or noncommercial copyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no matter how egregious the infringement or how great the loss to the copyright holder. This presents an enormous loophole in criminal liability for willful infringers who can use digital technology to make exact copies of copyrighted software and other digitally encoded works, and then use computer networks for quick, inexpensive and mass distribution of pirated, infringing works. This bill would close this loophole. 
United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is an example of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In that case, an MIT student set up computer bulletin board systems on the Internet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software programs. This resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over $1 million over a 6-week period. Since the student apparently did not profit from the software piracy, the Government could not prosecute him under criminal copyright law and instead charged him with wire fraud. The district court described the student's conduct `at best * * * as irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and 
lacking in any fundamental sense of values.' 
Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because it viewed copyright law as the exclusive remedy for protecting intellectual property rights. The Court expressly invited Congress to revisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, stating:  
Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer. One can envision ways that the copyright law could be modified to permit such prosecution. But, `[i]t is the legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.' 
This bill would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful copyright infringements in the following ways: First, serious acts of willful copyright infringement that result in multiple copies over a limited time period and cause significant loss to the copyright holders, would be subject to criminal prosecution. 
The bill would add a new offense prohibiting willful copyright infringement by reproduction or distributing, including by electronic means, during a 180-day period of 10 or more copies of 1 or more copyrighted works when the total retail value of the copyrighted work or the total retail value of the copies of such work is $5,000 or more. The bill makes clear that to meet the monetary threshold either the infringing copies or the copyrighted works must have a total retail value of $5,000 or more. The penalty would be a misdemeanor if the total retail value of the infringed or infringing works is between $5,000 and $10,000, and up to 3 years' imprisonment if the total retail value is $10,000 or more. 
By contrast, the penalties proposed for for-profit infringement are much stiffer. Specifically, under the existing 17 U.S.C. section 506(a)(1), for-profit infringements in which the retail value of the infringing works is less than $2,500, would constitute a misdemeanor; and, if the retail value of the infringing works is $2,500 or more, the penalty is up to 5 years' imprisonment. As discussed below, this bill would change the monetary threshold amount for felony liability under section 506(a)(1) from $2,500 to $5,000. 
The monetary, time period and number of copies thresholds for the new offense, under 17 U.S.C. section 506(a)(2), for not-for-profit infringements, combined with the scienter requirement, would insure that criminal charges would only apply to willful infringements, not merely casual or careless conduct, that result in a significant level of harm to the copyright holder's rights. De minimis, not-for-profit violations, including making a single pirated copy or distributing pirated copies of works worth less than a total of 
$5,000, would not be subject to criminal prosecution. 
This bill would require that at least 10 or more copies of the infringed work be made, which is a quantity requirement that was not present for the new not-for-profit infringement offense in the version of the bill introduced in the 104th Congress. Thus, it would not be a crime under the bill to make a single copy of a copyrighted work, even if that work were very valuable and worth over $10,000. Such valuable intellectual property, whether or not copyrighted, that is stolen could be protected under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, if it is a trade secret, or under the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996, which Senator Kyl and I sponsored, if the means used to complete the theft involved unauthorized computer access. 
Second, the bill would increase the monetary threshold for the existing criminal copyright offense, which makes it a misdemeanor to commit any willful infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain, and a felony if 10 or more copies of works with a retail value of over $2,500 are made during a 180-day period. The bill would increase the monetary threshold in this offense from $2,500 to $5,000 for felony liability. 
Third, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly recidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony criminal copyright offense. Under existing law, repeat offenders who commit a second or subsequent offense of copyright infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain are subject to imprisonment for up to 10 years. The bill would also double the term of imprisonment from 3 years to 6 years for a repeat offense for noncommercial copyright infringement. Such a calibration of penalties takes an important step in ensuring adequate deterrence of repeated willful copyright infringements. 
Fourth, the bill would extend the statute of limitations for criminal copyright infringement actions from 3 to 5 years, which is the norm for violations of criminal laws under title 18, including those protecting intellectual property. 
Finally, the bill would strengthen victims' rights by giving victimized copyright holders the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement to the sentencing court. In addition, the bill would direct the Sentencing Commission to set sufficiently stringent sentencing guideline ranges for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses to deter these crimes. 
Technological developments and the emergence of the national information infrastructure in this country and the global information infrastructure worldwide hold enormous promise and present significant challenges for protecting creative works. Increasing accessibility and affordability of information and entertainment services are important goals that oftentimes require prudent balancing of public and private interests. In the area of creative rights, that balance has rested on encouraging creativity by ensuring rights that reward it while encouraging its public availability. 
The Copyright Act is grounded in the copyright clause of the Constitution and assures that `contributors to the store of knowledge [receive] a fair return for their labors.' Harper & Row `The Nation Enterprises', 471 U.S. 539, 546 (1985). I am mindful, however, that when we exercise our power to make criminal certain forms of copyright infringement, we should act with `exceeding caution' to protect the public's first amendment interest in the dissemination of ideas. Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 221 (1985).

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is my hope that Joel Klein will be a strong and effective advocate for competition and the interests of consumers when he is confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. 
I had a close working relationship with his predecessor, Anne Bingaman. I hope that we can develop that kind of relationship, as well. 
Mr. Klein has been buffeted a good bit since being nominated. He had to answer some tough questions during his nomination hearing about approving the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger without conditions. After the Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate on May 8, he responded to a letter from Senator Burns and succeeded in convincing our colleague to remove his hold on this nomination. That letter and an addendum filed by Mr. Klein as Acting Assistant Attorney in connection with the application of SBC Communications before the FCC raised serious concerns for a number of other Senators, however. 
Last week the Senate proceeded by unanimous consent to consideration of this nomination. Until that moment, I understood there to have been Republican holds against this nominee. Why the Republican leadership proceeded immediately upon calling up this nomination to file a cloture petition, they will have to explain. In fact, we had worked out a time agreement for the debate before the unnecessary cloture vote on Monday. That agreement was confirmed by the majority and minority leaders and pursuant thereto we are debating the nomination today. 
In this regard, I note the consistent willingness of Senator Hollings to debate and vote on this nomination from the outset, and the sincere efforts of Senators Dorgan and Kerrey to obtain clarification of issues that concern many of us. 
I have given a good deal of thought to this nomination. I believe that the Antitrust Division and the Assistant Attorney General who heads it are extremely important to effective enforcement of our laws and protection of American consumers. I have come to rely on them for advice as we draft legislation and develop policies to foster competition. 
I hope to continue to do so. I believe that the President is to be given significant deference on his selections for his Administration team. The Attorney General has contacted us in support of Mr. Klein and his interpretation of the law, and that means a good deal to me. As I consider the legal interpretations and policies in question, I do not find myself in total agreement with the Acting Assistant Attorney General. Nonetheless, I will vote to confirm him. 
Unlike some who have spoken in opposition to this nomination, I feel that a good deal of the fault I find with Mr. Klein's positions stems from the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I worked hard to correct and improve that act's weak and deferential standards for ensuring competition. In some measure we succeeded in strengthening the act, but other significant provisions that I supported to foster competition and protect consumers were rejected. That was a principal factor in my decision to vote against that act--the bill was not strong enough. 
Others predicted that passage of the Telecommunications Act would launch an era of competition in which cable companies would compete with the regional Bell operating companies for local phone service, long distance companies would compete with the Bells in both local and long distance services, and regional Bell operating companies would compete against each other. The promise of competition was a sales pitch but has not materialized to benefit American consumers. Instead of competition, we see entrenchment, mega-mergers, consolidation, and the divvying up of markets. 
I, too, hoped that the Justice Department Antitrust Division would act aggressively to protect consumers and foster competition. I have noted my concerns during Mr. Klein's confirmation hearing in my questioning of his unconditional approval of the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger. If the current law only serves to protect against mergers that tend to diminish competition where it already exists, it may be time to amend the law to foster competition where none has existed. I hope that Joel Klein will help us do that. 
I was taken aback by the language Mr. Klein used in his May 20 letter to Senator Burns by which he `specifically rejected the suggestion in the conference report' on the Telecommunications Act that the 8(c) test be employed. But the more that I reviewed the matter, the more I realized that much of the fault lies with the conference report itself and the Telecommunications Act's failure to provide a definitive test. 
I was not appointed to serve on that conference committee, although I was serving as the ranking Democrat on the Antitrust Subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee at the time. I would have wanted to help that conference incorporate a stronger test into the law. That did not happen. 
It is my hope that working with the Department of Justice we can now help ensure that the test the Attorney General has adopted--that the local market be fully and irreversibly open to competition--is a meaningful standard and strong enforcement tool. If not, Congress should revisit it and strengthen it. 
I do think that Senator Hollings is correct when he criticizes the addendum to the Justice Department's submission in connection with the SBC Communications application. Both Senator Hollings and Congressman Bliley concur as principal drafters of the law regarding their intent and its meaning. I trust that the Antitrust Division will review its position on the proper meaning of section 271 of the Telecommunications Act and its requirement for competing service providers to offer facilities-based services. 
In opening the debate on this nomination, Senator Hatch cited `ambiguities left in the wake of the Telecommunications law' and `unsettled policy areas' and said:  
But I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold a nominee hostage because of such concerns, especially one as competent and decent as Joel Klein. In my view, sound public policy is best served by bringing this nominee up for a vote permitting the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed chief of the Antitrust Division, and for us in Congress to move forward and work with the Department and other involved agencies in the formulation and implementation of telecommunications policies. 
I agree. I look forward to the Judiciary Committee and our Antitrust Subcommittee exploring these important competition and antitrust policy matters. I will likewise expect Senator Hatch to support other Administration nominees for areas in which policies are in controversy. 
Now that the majority leader has moved to implement his new hold policy of proceeding on nominations, I trust he will not delay any further the nomination of Eric Holder to be Deputy Attorney General and that he will promptly move to consideration of the judicial nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee over the last several weeks. 
Some wrongly view confirmation as the end of the nominee's work with the Senate. I hope that this is just the beginning of Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein's work with us to protect consumers and foster competition. This is an awesome responsibility.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the President on his nomination of Eric H. Holder, Jr., and am delighted that the Senate is acting to confirm this nominee to be Deputy Attorney General of the United States. 
It was with concerted effort that Senator Hatch and I worked to ensure that Eric Holder was reported by the Judiciary Committee and ready for Senate confirmation to the important position of Deputy Attorney General of the United States before the Senate adjourned 3 weeks ago. 
The President's nomination of Mr. Holder to the second highest position at the Department of Justice was reported to the Senate without a single dissent on June 24. This nomination could and should have been approved by the Senate before it adjourned for the last extended recess for the Fourth of July. This nomination is strongly supported by Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
There was and is no Democratic hold on this nomination. The delay on the Republican side in considering this nomination remains unexplained. I urged on July 10 and July 11 that he not be held hostage to other nominations. I am glad we have finally--finally after 3 weeks--freed this nomination. 
Eric Holder has proven his dedication to effective law enforcement. As a former prosecutor myself, I appreciate Mr. Holder's distinguished career in law enforcement. 
Shortly after his graduation from Columbia Law School, Mr. Holder joined the Department of Justice as part of the Attorney General's Honors Program. He was assigned to the newly formed public integrity section in 1976, where he worked for 12 years investigating and prosecuting corruption. While at the public integrity section, Mr. Holder participated in a number of prosecutions and appeals involving such defendants as the State Treasurer of Florida, a former Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, a local judge in Philadelphia, an assistant U.S. attorney in New York City, an FBI agent, and a `capo' in an organized crime family. He received a number of awards for outstanding performance and special achievement from the Department of Justice. 
In 1988, President Reagan nominated and the Senate confirmed Mr. Holder to be an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, where he served for the next 5 years. In his 5 years on the bench, Judge Holder presided over hundreds of criminal trials. In 1993, President Clinton nominated and the Senate confirmed Eric Holder to the important post of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. As United States Attorney for one of the largest U.S. Attorney's offices in the Nation, Mr. Holder has supervised 300 lawyers involved in criminal, civil, and appellate cases. He has functioned as both the local district attorney and the Federal prosecutor. He has been active in community affairs. For more than a decade, he has been a member of Concerned Black Men, an organization seeking to help young people in the District of Columbia. He is involved in a number of the group's activities, including the efficacy program and the pregnancy prevention effort. He has participated in the D.C. Street Law program and is active in the See Forever Foundation and the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. He is cochair of Project PACT to reduce youth violence and has been instrumental in the U.S. Attorney's Office's outreach efforts to the D.C. community. 
In 1994 he received the Pioneer Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association. In 1995 his contributions were recognized when he received awards from the District of Columbia Bar Association, the Greater Washington Urban League, the American Jewish Congress, and Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. Last year he received awards from the D.C. Chapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, George Washington University, Columbia College, the Federation of Citizens Associations of D.C., Omega Psi Phi fraternity, the Brotherhood of Shiloh Men, McDonalds and the Asian Pacific Bar Association. 
I look forward to working with him in his new position as Deputy Attorney General. I regret the unnecessary delays that have stalled this important nomination for the last 3 weeks on the Senate Executive Calendar.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I concur with the Senator from North Dakota on this matter. The International Fund for Agricultural Development has supplied nearly 300 microfinance projects with almost $1 billion of funding. I am particularly pleased that 40 percent of these projects have been in sub-Saharan Africa, where the need for this type of assistance is greatest. 
It seems to me that the Agency for International Development should certainly consider using IFAD's capabilities. I therefore will likely support the House position on this matter and urge the conferees to include appropriate language in the statement of managers accompanying the conference report.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alaska will yield, I say for my colleagues one of the joys of the Appropriations Committee is that there are a lot of senior Members on both sides of the aisle who are used to working with each other to build the kind of personal relationships that are necessary. I cherish my own friendship with the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Kentucky. We have worked together on a lot of different pieces of legislation, not just this one but a lot of others, and I think we understand there are certain things that can be done and certain things that cannot be done, and we go for the possible. 
I note that this is a record, and I commend the Senator from Kentucky for getting it through so rapidly. But it is a case, again, I would say to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who sat down with us and tried to give us leeway, a realistic schedule, of the ability to work out many things even before they got to the floor. 
I have been both a manager and the ranking member of a lot of pieces of legislation. What has been happening with the appropriations bills is a model of the way it should be done--move them, move them quickly. People have an issue; vote on it and move on to the next thing. The Senate is better served. The country is better served. 
I commend my two colleagues for their help.

There is an awful lot that goes on among staff to make this possible. We do not have the expertise of the staff. We cannot move a bill this quickly no matter how hard we Senators may try, and I commend the staff on both sides of the aisle in this case.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and the distinguished Senator from Nebraska in opposing this amendment. I, too, would note that OPIC does return money to the Treasury--the figure $209 million last year was used here. More important, it creates jobs in America. 
I represent, in population, the second smallest State in the Union. OPIC is used in my State. It creates jobs, it creates exports, it helps our balance of payments. When you go to the larger States, of course, the dollar amount is just that much greater. 
I do not know a business in my State that has turned to OPIC that has not received enormous help. I remember when the former Director of OPIC came to Vermont. She held a meeting there. We had lines going out the door; business people wanting to work with OPIC. It is one of those success stories. 
It is also an area where we have to have the kind of tools that all our competitors have. We are in worldwide markets. We can no longer just rely on New Hampshire selling to Vermont, Vermont selling to New Hampshire, as an example. I say that seeing my good friend from New Hampshire is the distinguished Presiding Officer. We export way beyond our States, way beyond the borders of our Nation. But, every other First World--and a lot that go beyond the First World--country does the same. If they are a major exporter, as we are, there are boards like OPIC that help them. 
Are there things that can be done better or different than OPIC? Possibly. But I ask the authorizing committee to look at that. 
There will be an authorizing bill on OPIC. I am perfectly willing to listen to the recommendations of my friends on both sides of the aisle. 
We felt, the Senator from Kentucky and myself--he as chairman and I as ranking member--in looking at these figures for OPIC that the amounts made sense. There certainly was unanimous concurrence of Republicans and Democrats on our subcommittee and in the full committee for the same reason. 
If an authorizing bill comes through and changes that, it can change it. This money doesn't have to be spent and an authorizing bill can make a difference. I suspect with such an authorizing bill, you are going to hear success story after success story from States all over the Nation helped by OPIC. 
So I hope my good friend from Colorado will withhold this amendment and let it be a matter to be discussed with the authorizing committee, but not on this appropriations bill. 
I yield the floor.

Leaders in the opposition have been murdered. This is a violent coup. 
The amendment makes clear that assistance for nongovernmental organizations would be allowed to continue. 
I want to make sure we don't inadvertently prevent aid from resuming if the democratically elected government is restored. But I have no doubt, in that kind of situation, that the Senator from Kentucky would want to make clear--or, if that occurred, would want to join with some of us to make clear--that such aid would continue. But this has been a very violent coup. Opposition people are being silenced or killed. And I support the intent of the amendment by the Senator from Kentucky.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that my amendment to strengthen our ability to prosecute war criminals in the United States has been accepted by the Republican side. 
This amendment, which builds on the War Crimes Act of 1996, closes some gaps in our Nation's implementation of the Geneva and Hague Conventions. 
The War Crimes Act of 1996 only permits prosecution for war crimes in the United States if the person accused of committing the crime, or the victim of a war crime, is a national of the United States or a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. While noble in its intent, that act does not permit the United States to prosecute non-U.S. nationals who come within our jurisdiction. It leaves the United States open as a potential safe-haven for war criminals seeking to escape prosecution. 
Currently, we have no extradition treaties with 75 nations including Somalia, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Iran. If a war criminal from any of these countries takes refuge in the United States, we cannot extradite him. The alternative--deportation--is a long and complex process which becomes even more difficult when the accused is to be deported to a specific country. Even if deportation is successful, a war criminal may be returned to a country in which the judicial system is nonfunctional--Cambodia, for example--thus escaping prosecution altogether. 
My amendment allows us to prosecute war criminals located in the United States, regardless of their nationality. The amendment in no way obligates the United States to prosecute war crimes, nor does it permit the extradition of non-U.S. nationals of the United States for prosecution if the victims of the crime are not United States nationals. Any case undertaken by our Government requires written notification to the Congress by the Attorney General, who must take into consideration U.S. national interests and the necessity of U.S. prosecution, to assure a just resolution in each case. The United States will not be drawn into international conflicts where we have no significant national interest. 
The amendment expands the scope and offers a more specific definition of what constitutes a war crime that the 1996 act. The 1996 act only refers to grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which are defined as willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully or wantonly.' 
My proposed 1997 amendments also covers articles of the 1907 Hague Convention IV which clarify actions prohibited in war. 
The inclusion of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is vital in that it expressly allows the United States to prosecute war crimes perpetrated in noninternational conflicts, such as Bosnia and Rwanda. In January 1997, there were a reported 35 such internal conflicts, from Algeria to Kasmir. 
Finally, violations of the protocol on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of mines, booby-traps and other devices will constitute a war crime under this amendment, once the United States ratifies this important protocol. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross, the American Red Cross, the State Department, the Department of Defense, and President Clinton all support the expansion of United States prosecutorial authority as it is contained in this amendment. With its adoption, we will be following in the footsteps of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia--each of which passed similar laws in the 1950's. It is time for us to join them.

Mr. Leahy. Mr. President, I support Senator Durbin's amendment to condition IMET for Peru on timely, open and fair legal proceedings in civilian courts for United States citizens being held in Peru. 
The Government of Peru deserves credit for the progress in human rights it has made in recent years. The number of extrajudicial killings and disappearances has decreased dramatically. However, freedom of the press, executive interference in the judiciary, the existence of faceless military courts for civilians, lengthy pre-trial detention and abysmal prison conditions continue to be serious problems. This amendment conditions IMET assistance on speedy resolution of the cases of American citizens who are in Peruvian prisons awaiting a fair trial. 
Jennifer Davis and Krista Barnes each have admitted their guilt on drug-trafficking charges and cooperated fully with the Peruvian police. They have been imprisoned for over 9 months, waiting to be tried and sentenced so they may be transferred to a U.S. prison under our prisoner exchange treaty. They are victims of Peru's excruciatingly slow legal process and life-threatening prison conditions. 
Lori Berenson was tried, convicted and sentenced almost 2 years ago under a legal system set up to combat terrorism in Peru that violates international standards of due process. In late 1996, the Peruvian military's highest court upheld her life sentence. Ms. Berenson plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of Peru. In the meantime, Ms. Berenson is struggling through another winter in prison in the freezing mountains of Peru. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that this amendment will encourage Peru not just to take action in the cases of these young women, but that it will spark a vigorous effort to improve the judicial process in Peru so that no one--no Peruvian or American or any other citizen--will have to endure lengthy pretrial detention, wretched prison conditions and a clogged legal docket that violate minimum international standards of due process and the treatment of prisoners.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that I enjoy working with him. But I know the Senate is in the able hands of the distinguished Senator from Utah. Now that I have somebody who actually looks a little bit like me on the floor, I, too, can leave.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, because of a meeting with the President and the Vice President, I was unable to be here for the opening of this bill, and I did want to make note of a couple items. 
First, I do commend my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who has put together a bill which I believe both parties, both Republicans and Democrats, can and should support. I should note that last year the foreign operations bill passed the Senate by a vote of 93 to 7, which is pretty darned good for such a piece of legislation. This year's bill I think will pass by an even higher margin. 
I thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, and the senior Democrat on the committee, Senator Byrd, for providing us with an allocation that has made it possible to fund many of the administration's foreign policy priorities, in fact, most of the priorities of Members of the Senate, and that is extremely important as we go into conference with the other body. 
For the past 3 years, Senator McConnell and I and Senator Lugar and others have argued that U.S. leadership costs money. Senator McConnell has fought efforts in the House to cut funding for programs that are vital to U.S. foreign policy and national security. I think all of us owe him a debt of gratitude for that. I take the attitude, which is the attitude of all Vermonters ahead of me, that in foreign policy matters especially we should try to develop bipartisanship. The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska did that in developing the allocation in this bill. While I am the only Member of my party ever to be elected from the State of Vermont, I look back to distinguished predecessors as Senators from Vermont who always tried to develop that bipartisanship in foreign policy. This bill appropriates additional funds for development assistance in microenterprise, health and education, agriculture, and many other activities supported strongly on both sides of the aisle--a special fund for combating infectious diseases. I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for that. 
This is an area that I was particularly concerned about. We have seen an alarming increase in TB and other diseases that were once thought to be under control, new viruses like Ebola. These pose a threat to America. You might ask what American interest is there in that in a foreign aid bill. It is very simple. These funds will help monitor and combat these diseases. A microbe does not stop at a border and get a visa before it moves on to the next country. Microbes and viruses, diseases, some of the most horrendous diseases known in our lifetime, traveled freely across borders. 
In an era where a Member of Congress does much traveling, we see how people can be, for example, in Kenya and be back in Washington in a matter of long hours, but it is possible to travel that way, sometimes perhaps arriving even a few minutes later than they might have liked, but being able to arrive. 
I should note for the Record that this reflects sort of a private joke between the distinguished Presiding Officer, my good friend, and myself. But the point is people do travel and, unlike the old days when you looked at a different continent one would never visit, now we go back and forth, and diseases do, too. 
My wife, who works as a registered nurse, sees far, far more patients with TB today than she had seen a decade ago. We see far more diseases that we thought had disappeared popping up again. What we want to do is have money in here to help us monitor countries where these diseases are coming up, help the world organizations most involved in this to isolate and quarantine and help eradicate diseases before they travel into our country or other countries. 
I also appreciate what has been done to fund IDA. Even though it is $950 million, it is close to and goes a long way toward meeting our past commitments. The same goes for UNICEF, a favorite organization of mine, and other U.N. agencies. We were able to provide $60 million for the global environment facility. The GEF plays a central role in protecting international waters and biodiversity, replacing ozone depletion. It is a step in the right direction. I would like to see a United States contribution to the African Development Fund. I would like to see more funds for voluntary peacekeeping, disaster relief programs. 
There were some hard choices. I point out to people that most programs that did not receive full funding, and they are relatively few, were distributed fairly evenly across the various accounts here. 
I have other areas of concern, and I will speak to those when the time comes. 
I say only this in closing, Mr. President. We have a tremendous opportunity to influence economic and political events around the world, but diplomacy costs money. It is money to support programs that will in a very real way determine what kind of world our children's grandchildren live in. We are the most powerful nation in the world, the greatest democracy history has ever known, and we have a responsibility to the rest of the world because of that. We do not live in isolation, and this bill helps us say that. 
Mr. President, I do not see others seeking the floor, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to highlight a provision in the energy and water appropriations bill which could begin to address some of the energy generation problems facing very rural areas. The bill provides modest funding for the deployment of solar, wind, fuel cell, and biomass technologies in remote areas of the United States. 
Producing and distributing power in rural areas is a challenge in and of itself. Distribution lines are often more expensive and difficult to establish, and communities are often forced to rely on cheaper, but more polluting fuel sources. This demonstration will provide the resources to look at the effectiveness of less noxious, renewable energy technologies. 
One application of this kind of demonstration which has come to my attention is a proposal in Vermont to replace polluting diesel engines with modern fuel cell technology for snow production. One of the last places you might think of air quality problems is in the mountains of Vermont. But in fact, four of the six largest sources of NOx emissions in the State are ski resorts which often use inefficient and dirty burning diesel engines to produce snow. Because of the remoteness of snow production facilities, other, cleaner commercial energy alternatives are not an option. This funding would allow States like Vermont to experiment with energy production technologies that can work efficiently while greatly reducing NOx and particulate matter emissions. 
I would like to thank the Senator from New Mexico for funding this valuable initiative and ask for his comments on this possible application of fuel cell technology to the problem I have described in Vermont.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Members of the Senate may have read in the papers a few weeks ago about the discovery of a Revolutionary War gunboat found in the waters of Lake Champlain, bordering my home State of Vermont. There, perfectly preserved in the cold, fresh, dark water, lying upright on the bottom, is a 54-foot gunboat, its mast still standing and its bow cannon in place. 
This gunboat is one of eight led by Benedict Arnold against the British in the Battle of Valcour Island on October 11, 1776. Only four vessels survived the battle, but the British were forced to delay their invasion from Canada for an extra year, giving the Americans critical time to prepare defenses. 
Mr. President, this historic find led the former curator of naval history at the Smithsonian's American History Museum, Mr. Philip Lundeberg, to say, `This could prove to be the most significant maritime discovery in American history in the last half century.' 
The exact location of the ship is a secret, and it will not be touched until maritime archeologists, working with the Navy and local authorities, develop a comprehensive management plan to preserve and protect this amazing discovery. The ship may be left as an underwater museum, or it may be feasible to raise and preserve it. We will not know until the management plan is completed. 
In the bill before the Senate today, the Appropriations Committee funded a modest program called Legacy, which coordinates cultural resource management efforts among the four military services. I ask my friend from Alaska, will the Senator support my effort in conference with the other body to designate a small amount of Legacy funding to develop the management plan that will preserve and protect this important historical find?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I noted yesterday my concern that the Senate is failing to proceed to confirm the four judicial nominees and the nominee to be Deputy Attorney General of the United States. The Republican leader had indicated that today he intended to take up the nomination of Mr. Holder to be the Deputy Attorney General, the second highest ranking official in the Department of Justice. Now it appears that the Republican leadership has decided not to proceed to that nomination but to hold it hostage to the confirmation of the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust. 
I urge the majority leader to abandon this brinkmanship. There is no need to tie up a noncontroversial and consensus nominee for the important position of Deputy Attorney General. In my view we could have proceeded to that matter before the last recess. In any event, there clearly is no justification for tying confirmation of the Deputy to any other nominee. 
Likewise, I again urge the Republican leadership to proceed to consideration of the four judicial nominees favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee over the last 7 weeks. Yesterday, we succeeded in reporting three additional judicial nominees. I would hope that we could proceed to their confirmations early next week. Confirming those 7 nominations pending on the executive calendar would literally double our production for the first 6 months of this session. 
We are still confirming judges at a rate of less than one judge per month. Twenty-three judicial nominees remain pending before the Judiciary Committee, some have been bottled up in committee for as long as 27 months.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr, President, the city of St. Albans, VT, this year celebrates its centennial, and thousands of citizens turned out on July 5 to mark the occasion in a festive and flawless celebration blessed by Vermont's glorious July weather. 
There was a grand parade organized by the St. Albans Rotary Club. There was music. There were recollections and mementos of the city's rich history. And there was a community photograph. 
In an article about the centennial published in the Burlington Free Press, reporter Richard Cowperthwait captured the festivities and the sense of history that all Vermonters share. Included in the article is this apt observation from St. Albans Mayor Peter DesLauriers: `We've gone through the life and death of our railroad; we've gone through fires; we've gone through all of these things and today--right now--I think we're literally on the top of the heap here.'

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was with concerted effort that Senator Hatch and I worked to ensure that Eric Holder was reported by the Judiciary Committee and ready for Senate confirmation to the important position of Deputy Attorney General of the United States before the Senate adjourned 2 weeks ago. The President's nomination of Mr. Holder to the second highest position at the Department of Justice was reported to the Senate without a single dissent on June 24. This nomination could and should have been approved by the Senate before it adjourned for the last extended recess. It is strongly supported by Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
There was and is no Democratic hold on this nomination. The delay on the Republican side in considering this nomination remains unexplained. 
Eric Holder has proven his dedication to effective law enforcement. As a former prosecutor myself, I appreciate Mr. Holder's distinguished career in law enforcement. 
Shortly after his graduation from Columbia Law School, Mr. Holder joined the Department of Justice as part of the Attorney General's Honors Program. He was assigned to the newly formed Public Integrity Section in 1976, where he worked for 12 years investigating and prosecuting corruption. 
While at the Public Integrity Section, Mr. Holder participated in a number of prosecutions and appeals involving such defendants as the State treasurer of Florida, a former Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, a local judge in Philadelphia, an assistant U.S. attorney in New York City, an FBI agent, and a capo in an organized crime family. He received a number of awards for outstanding performance and special achievement from the Department of Justice. 
In 1988, President Reagan nominated and the Senate confirmed Mr. Holder to be an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, where he served for the next 5 years. In his 5 years on the bench, Judge Holder presided over hundreds of criminal trials. 
In 1993, President Clinton nominated and the Senate confirmed Eric Holder to the important post of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. As U.S. attorney for one of the largest U.S. Attorney's offices in the Nation, Mr. Holder has supervised 300 lawyers involved in criminal, civil and appellate cases. He has functioned as both the local district attorney and the Federal prosecutor. 
He has been active in community affairs. For more than a decade, he has been a member of Concerned Black Men, an organization seeking to help young people in the District of Columbia. He is involved in a number of the group's activities, including the Efficacy Program and the pregnancy prevention effort. He has participated in the D.C. Street Law Program and is active in the See Forever Foundation and the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. He is cochair of Project PACT to reduce youth violence and has been instrumental in the U.S. attorney's office's outreach efforts to the D.C. community. 
In 1994, he received the Pioneer Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association. In 1995, his contributions were recognized when he received awards from the District of Columbia Bar Association, the Greater Washington Urban League, the American Jewish Congress, and Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. Last year, he received awards from the D.C. Chapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, George Washington University, Columbia College, the Federation of Citizens Associations of the District of Columbia, Omega Psi Phi fraternity, the Brotherhood of Shiloh Men, McDonald's, and the Asian Pacific Bar Association. 
I urge the Republican leadership to move forward without further delay and confirm the nomination of Eric Holder to be Deputy Attorney General.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I last spoke to the Senate about the crisis being created by our failure to move forward expeditiously to fill longstanding judicial vacancies on June 26, the day before we left on our most recent recess. I pointed out then that we had the opportunity literally to double judicial confirmations for the year from 5 to 10 by taking up and approving the five judicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar. In spite of the noncontroversial nature of these nominees and their likely confirmation, the Republican leadership refused to consider them. 
As the Senate returns from another extended recess we enter July having found time to confirm only 6 Federal judges of the 39 nominees the President has sent to us. That remains a confirmation rate of less than one judge per month. We continue to fall farther and farther behind the pace established by Senator Dole and Senator Hatch in the last Congress. By this time 2 years ago, Senator Hatch had held six confirmation hearings involving 26 judicial nominees and the Senate had proceeded to confirm 26 Federal judges by the end of June--during one of the busiest periods ever, during the first 100 days of the Republicans' `Contract with America.' 
I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the 100 vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country, as has the Chief Justice of the United States. At the rate that we are currently going more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of greater numbers of Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. 
There are four highly-qualified judicial nominees on the Senate calendar, another five district court nominees who were the subject of a confirmation hearing on June 25 but who have yet to receive attention from the Judiciary Committee, and another 24 nominees for whom the committee has yet to schedule a hearing or consideration. 
That judges were held hostage to the resolution of other nomination disputes was a shame. I had urged the Republican leadership not to use the judiciary as a political pressure point or to involve the judiciary in disagreement over other matters, but they chose to act otherwise. 
I would hope that the Senate would move to confirm these four additional judges on its calendar without further delay this week. Three of them had their confirmation hearing back in early May and have been on the Senate calendar without action for more than 6 weeks. The other had a confirmation hearing back in March, and was reported for a second time almost 1 month ago. 
The Republican leadership chose to single out only one judicial nominee for a unanimous consent request and approval before the most recent recess. Over the break I took the trouble to review the record on that nominee to see whether it held a clue regarding why that particular nominee, as opposed to the other qualified nominees, had been singled out for special attention. 
Nominated by the President on February 12 of this year, Alan Gold is set to fill a vacancy that was created on the District Court for the Southern District of Florida on November 30, 1996, when Judge Gonzalez took senior status. His is the only vacancy remaining on that Court and it has existed for less than 7 months. He was included in a confirmation hearing on May 7 and reported by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks later. 
As I have said before, it should not take more than 4 months to consider a judicial nominee and the Gold nomination and its treatment should serve as the standard by which we measure the Senate's treatment of other nominees. Although it should represent the normal process, it is the exception this year. 
He has a commendable background but so do the other nominees for judicial appointment. In reviewing the file, I see that Judge Gold was rated well qualified by the ABA. Given Senator Hatch's speech condemning the influence of the ABA and its ratings in our confirmation process, I doubt that explains his prompt confirmation. Eric Clay was also rated well qualified for his Sixth Circuit nomination and he was held back on the calendar. William Fletcher, James Beatty, Margaret MeKeown, Marjorie Rendell, Richard Lazzara, Margaret Morrow and others have likewise received the ABA's highest rating and have not seen their nominations expedited. 
In reviewing his confirmation hearing and the answers to the written questions that followed, I see that he singled out for criticism the case of Griswold versus Connecticut, which affirmed a privacy right guaranteed by the Constitution, and listed as the book that has most influenced his view of the law `The Tempting of America' by Robert Bork. My fear is that this confirmation reflects a litmus test being imposed by the Republican majority and that is why they singled out this nomination for expedited treatment. I hope that is not so. 
I hope that nominees are not being forced to swear allegiance to Robert Bork instead of the Constitution of the United States in order to be confirmed. I hope that a nominee can uphold the important privacy rights that the Supreme Court has recognized to be constitutionally based and still be confirmed. I would like to believe that there is a neutral, alternative explanation for the treatment of this nomination relative to the others and that no Senator is imposing an ideological litmus test on judicial nominations.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, The Supreme Court has made clear that we do not forfeit our First Amendment rights when we go on-line. This decision is a landmark in the history of the Internet and a firm foundation for its future growth. Altering the protections of the First Amendment for on-line communications would have crippled this new mode of communication. 
The Communications Decency Act was misguided and unworkable. It reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the Internet, and it would have unwisely offered the world a model of online censorship instead of a model of online freedom. 
Vigilant defense of freedom of thought, opinion and speech will be crucially important as the Internet graduates from infancy into adolescence and maturity. Giving full-force to the First Amendment on-line is a victory for the First Amendment, for American technology and for democracy. 
The Supreme Court posed the right question: `Could a speaker confidently assume that a serious discussion about birth control practices, homosexuality . . . or the consequences of prison rape would not violate the CDA? This uncertainty undermines the likelihood that the CDA has been carefully tailored to the congressional goal of protecting minors from potentially harmful materials.' 
Mixing government and politics with free speech issues often produces a corrosive concoction that erodes our constitutional freedoms. Congress should not be spooked by new technology into tampering with our old Constitution. Even well-intended laws for the protection of children deserve close examination to ensure that we are not stepping over constitutional lines. The Supreme Court observed: 
we have repeatedly recognized the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials. . . . But that interest does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults. As we have explained, the Government may not `reduc[e] the adult population . . . to . . . only what is fit for children.' ' 
As a recent editorial in Vermont's Times Argus succinctly noted: `To obey this law, Internet users would have to avoid discussing matters routinely covered in books, magazines and newspapers. Who would want to drive on that kind of information superhighway?' 
I sent child molesters to prison when I was a prosecutor, and I am a parent myself. I want no effort spared in finding and prosecuting those who exploit our children, and I want strong laws and strong enforcement to do that. But the CDA is the wrong answer, and I applaud the Court for its decision. 
We can spend much time and energy in Congress trying to out-muscle each other to the most popular position on regulating the content of television programs or Internet offerings, and from all appearances, we probably will. We should take heed of the Supreme Court's decision today, however, and be wary of efforts to jump into regulating the content of any form of speech. 
Congress did jump when confronted with the CDA. The Supreme Court takes pains in its decision to note at least three times in its opinion that this law was brought as an amendment on the floor of the Senate and passed as part of the Telecommunications Act, without the benefit of hearings, findings, or considered deliberation. As the Supreme Court noted in its decision, I cautioned against such speedy action at the time. Not surprisingly, the end result was passage of an unconstitutional law. 
We should not be substituting the government's judgment for that of parents about what is appropriate for their children to access on-line. The Supreme Court pointed out excellent examples of how the CDA would have operated to do just that, noting: 
`Under the CDA, a parent allowing her 17-year-old to use the family computer to obtain information on the Internet that she, in her parental judgment, deems appropriate could face a lengthy prison term . . . Similarly, a parent who sent his 17-year-old college freshman information on birth control via e-mail could be incarcerated even though neither he, his child, or anyone in their home community, found the material `indecent' or `patently offensive,' if the college town's community thought otherwise.' 
I attended the Supreme Court's oral argument in this case and was concerned when several of the Justices asked about the `severability' clause in the CDA: They wanted to know how much of the statute could be stricken as unconstitutional and how much could be left standing. The majority of the Supreme Court resisted the temptation to do the job of Congress and judicially re-write the `indecency' and `patently offensive' provisions of the CDA to be constitutional. The Court said: `This Court `will not rewrite a . . . law to conform it to constitutional requirements.' 
It is our job to write constitutional laws that address the needs and concerns of Americans. On this issue, our work is not done. There is no lack of criminal laws on the books to protect children on-line, including laws criminalizing the on-line 
distribution of child pornography and obscene materials and prohibiting the on-line harassment, luring and solicitation of children for illegal sexual activity. Protecting children, whether in cyberspace or physical space, depends on aggressively enforcing these existing laws and supervising children to ensure they do not venture where the environment is unsafe. This will do more--and more effectively--than passing feel-good, unconstitutional legislation. 
But, as I said, our work is not done. The CDA became law because of the genuine concern of many Americans about the inappropriate material unquestionably accessible to computer-savvy children over the Internet. Parents, teachers, librarians, content providers, on-line service providers and policy-makers need to come together to find effective ways to address this concern. I have long believed that we need to put the emphasis where it would be most effective: on parental and user empowerment tools to control the information that children may access on-line. I applaud the efforts already underway to bring concerned groups together to define steps we can take to make the on-line world a comfortable one for families. 
Also, we should now remove the unconstitutional CDA provisions from our law books. At the beginning of this Congress, Senators Feingold, Jeffords, Kerry and I introduced a bill, S. 213, to repeal the Internet censorship provisions of the CDA. We should move promptly to pass that measure. 
One of the continuing challenges we will face in making the best use of our burgeoning information technologies is in adding value to all that they offer. Anyone who uses the Internet knows that there is a lot of junk out there. For example, student searching for background on the Holocaust may easily come across diatribes on the Internet claiming that the Holocaust never happened. In our classrooms, in our homes, in our libraries, we must teach our children to be discerning users of this powerful new tool. 
We are blessed in the United States to enjoy the oldest and most effective constitutional protections of free speech anywhere. The struggle facing succeeding generations of Americans in preserving free speech liberties often is difficult, and it means standing firm in the face of sometimes fleeting but usually intense political pressures, and I am proud of the 15 Senators who joined with me to vote against the CDA. This is a vindication of that effort. 
We have the technology and the temperament to show the world how the Internet can be used to its fullest. This decision has prevented us from succumbing to short-sighted political pressures by adopting a model of censorship instead.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past 5 months, we have been engaged in a troubling debate on how best to protect the health of our children, our elderly and our environment. Since the Environmental Protection Agency announced the proposed new standards for air quality, we have witnessed an unprecedented campaign by industry to block these new standards. Opponents instantly attacked the goals rather than sitting down to work with Congress and the administration on how to achieve these goals in a reasonable and cost-effective timeframe. I applaud EPA Administrator Carol Browner for standing up against the onslaught of industry backlash on the new standards. Today, President Clinton showed equal commitment by supporting the thrust of Administrator Browner's recommendation. This decision will reduce the smog and soot that drifts into Vermont from outside the State. I congratulate President Clinton for standing up for the health of our children and our environment. We can now begin the process of finding the most cost-effective means of implementing these standards. 
In Vermont, we recognize the benefits of high environmental standards. Over the years, conservationists and the business community have worked together to protect the environment. Vermonters know that a healthy environment promotes a healthy economy. Yet despite our commitment, Vermont and other Northeastern States have become the dumping ground for pollution that seeps across our borders each night with the wind. The new ozone standard makes the biggest pollutors accountable and will reduce the burden on States in the Northeast in their battle to maintain our high standards for air quality. Acid rain taught us that tough State environmental standards were not enough to protect us. We saw some of our healthiest forests die off from pollution borne from outside our region. This situation demands tough national environmental standards to ensure a level playing field. 
The new air standards will address two central issues: Where the smog and soot is landing and how to use new scientific evidence to continue improving efforts to protect public health. We learned from the acid rain debate that emissions from dirty coal-fired powerplants in the Midwest can be transported farther than 500 miles. More than 40 percent of the pollution in Vermont is from outside the state. We also know that utility restructuring will encourage increased generation at the powerplants in the Midwest. The new standards proposed by EPA will reduce the smog and soot that drifts into Vermont from these powerplants. Today's decision is a clear victory for the Northeast because we now have a standard that will reduce air pollution at its source. 
Since the passage of the Clean Air Act we have made considerable strides in reducing some pollutants. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. If we learned one thing from the acrimonious debate in Congress last year on environmental issues, it is that the American people do not want to halt the progress we have made and merely rest on our environmental laurels. Americans want to keep moving forward on cleaning up our environment. Unfortunately, as I listen to the debate on the Clean Air Act this Congress, I fear that we are not heeding their call. Instead of looking at ways to strengthen the Clean Air Act, we are trying to undercut the existing regulations. 
Today, the President recognized the 130 million Americans in 170 major cities who continue to breathe unhealthy air. Congress should listen as well and approve the standards. I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to oppose efforts to block the implementation of these new standards. Members of the House of Representatives have already launched their attack on the standards by introducing legislation to block the President's decision and weaken these standards. It is important to Vermont and to the Nation that we set aside the acrimonious debate that occurred on these standards and work together to develop a cost-effective implementation plan. 
The recommendations of the Ozone Transport Assessment Group that were approved by 32 States lay out several concrete steps to clean up our air in the Northeast. I challenge Administrator Browner and the administration to move quickly on these recommendations. In particular, I want Congress and the administration to look at what probably has become one of the largest loopholes in the Clean Air Act: Allowing the dirtiest power plants to continue to operate with vastly inadequate pollution controls. The need to go back and close this loophole now--in this session of Congress--assumes greater urgency because of the deregulation of the electric utility industry. 
Tomorrow's United Nations conference on the environment reminds us that we share the air, the water and our planet. There can be no greater legacy that we leave behind for our children and grandchildren than a society secure in its commitment to a healthy and environmentally sound future.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate yesterday passed H.R. 956, the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997. I have long been a supporter of substance abuse prevention programs, particularly for our youth, and was a cosponsor of the Senate's companion bill, S. 536. 
I am glad to see that my Republican colleagues have taken a second look at these types of prevention programs since the debate over the 1994 crime law. It clearly was time to stop debating the usefulness of prevention programs and instead make sure we authorized and funded such programs as the Drug Free Communities Act. 
Community-based prevention programs have proven to be an effective way to combat the problem of youth drug abuse. Throughout the country there are groups, large and small, public and private, whose mission is to reduce drug use among our young people. Many of these groups form coalitions, pool their resources, and work together to reach that goal. Groups such as D.A.R.E., MADD, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and Vermont's unique Kids N' Kops Program, serve communities every day with programs that involve entire communities and educate our youth in innovative ways so that they are secure in their decision not to use drugs. Those groups need to be supported and that is the purpose of H.R. 956. 
Many Americans are concerned about the problem of juvenile crime and delinquency, and drug abuse is a contributing factor. According to a recent report from the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the number of juvenile delinquency cases for drug offenses has increased significantly. In 1994, 61 percent of all delinquency cases were for drug offenses compared to 43 percent in 1985. Unfortunately, the proportion of drug offenses is higher in Vermont than the national average. Similarly disturbing are trends in the overall juvenile crime rate. While the juvenile violent crime rate dipped nationally in 1995, it rose in Vermont that same year. In addition, the number of juvenile violent crime arrests is 67 percent higher than in 1986. 
That is why at the beginning of this year, I along with a number of my Democratic colleagues, introduced S. 15, the Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997. This bill includes a number of initiatives to prevent juvenile crime and drug abuse, including providing funding for comprehensive drug education and prevention for all elementary and high school students, creating safe havens where children are protected 
from drugs, gangs, and crime. We must ensure that prevention programs and funding are included in S. 10, the Republican juvenile crime bill currently being considered in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. 
The Drug Free Communities Act of 1997 creates a 5-year, $143.5 million grant program to be run by Gen. Barry McCaffrey and the Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONCDP]. The purpose of the grant program is simple: to provide matching grants to community coalitions, particularly those dedicated to reducing drug abuse by young people. Established partnerships in local communities with positive track records can apply for grants of up to $100,000 per community. No new funding is required; it will come from redirecting money already in the $16 billion Federal antidrug budget. 
In Vermont, these resources will be put to good use. With the movement of gangs into Vermont and the rise in youth drug use, more resources are needed to serve our children. I am proud of the work that many of community groups are doing in Vermont. The Orleans County Prevention Partnership [OCCP] in Newport, VT, has spent the last 6 years fighting youth crime and drug use. OCCP was formed based on the premise that communities already possess a wealth of knowledge and talent to deal with these problems, but need resources to coordinate and harness community talents to the fullest. Over the years, this partnership has grown from the original 17 members to the current 117 members, including all segments of Orleans County from church groups to law enforcement to schools. This commitment has led to great results: The OCCP reports that, in Orleans County, liquor consumption among middle schoolers is down 15 percent, as are DWI arrests of teens and arrests for drug crimes in all age groups. The Prevention Coalition based in Brattleboro is also doing terrific work in drug prevention efforts in the southern part of the State. These coalitions know as well as anyone about the benefits of targeted prevention programs and that community partnerships are an effective way to approach this problem. The passage of H.R. 956 will provide them another tool in this battle.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I might note for my colleagues, the distinguished President pro tempore, the senior Senator from South Carolina, has set a remarkable example. In my 23 years here in the Senate, I think I have seen him as President pro tempore opening the Senate more times than I have seen anybody else. I note that this happens whether we have been in session half the night and coming in early in the morning, or whenever it is. I compliment my good friend from South Carolina. I am glad, however, to see that he does not carry the baseball bat here that was presented to him by the distinguished senior Senator from Utah and myself at the Judiciary Committee meeting last week.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly because I see the distinguished Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], on the floor. But I will reserve such time as I may need. 
Mr. President, the Leahy-Hagel bill on antipersonnel landmines is the result of years of work. I commend the Senator from Nebraska for his efforts in this. We have talked about the need to have a ban on these weapons, a need that is felt throughout the world, both by countries that have used landmines, such as ours, and also by countries that have been devastated by what has become a plague of landmines. As I have said on the floor many times, this human disaster was described to me by a Cambodian I had in my office on a snowy winter afternoon at Christmastime in Vermont--one of the most beautiful times of year in our State--and it became far less beautiful as he said, `We clear our landmines in Cambodia an arm and a leg at a time.' 
Fifty-seven Senators--Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, men and women alike--joined together last Thursday to introduce 
legislation to ban new deployments of antipersonnel landmines beginning in the year 2000. Our purpose is to enable the United States to join other nations around the world that have already shown both the moral and strategic courage and leadership by saying that they will ban unilaterally ban antipersonnel landmines. Senators like Bob Kerrey and John McCain, Chuck Robb, and Max Cleland, decorated Vietnam veterans, along with Senator Hagel, know far better than I what landmines have inflicted on our own soldiers. Senator Hagel has even been injured by them. 
All of us know that landmines have some marginal value, but so do chemical weapons. But we banned them. The problem with landmines is that wars end, peace treaties are signed, armies march away, the guns grow silent--but the landmines stay. To the child who steps on a mine on the way to school a year after the peace agreement is signed, that peace agreement is no protection. To the farmer who cannot raise crops to feed his or her children because the fields are strewn with landmines, that peace agreement is worth nothing. To the medical personnel and humanitarian workers who cannot get polio vaccine to a village where it is needed because of the landmines, that peace agreement is useless. 
What we have, Mr. President, is a weapon that has grown so grotesque, the use of which has gotten so out of balance that most responsible nations are uniting in one voice to say: Stop the horror of landmines. There are 100 million of them in the ground in some 68 countries that are waiting for a person to step on them and die, innocent civilians. There were over 64,000 American casualties from landmines in Vietnam. If that is not appalling enough, the majority of those landmines were built here in the United States and were killing American men and women half way around the world. In Bosnia, 279 U.N. and NATO soldiers have been injured or killed by landmines. Every American casualty in Bosnia from enemy causes has been from a landmine. Then you have thousands of innocent civilians that have lost arms, legs and so on. 
Sixty-eight countries have a bridge to the 21st century, Mr. President, but that bridge is strewn with landmines. The United States has the responsibility, as a moral leader, to help stop that. Great Britain, Canada, Germany, South Africa are all countries that can claim a greater need for landmines than we can because they do not have the power of the United States. They have unilaterally renounced the use of these landmines and are destroying stockpiles. But a White House official, who apparently has an extreme case of myopia--and I say that only because in polite dialog we would not say he has an extreme case of stupidity--had the audacity to say that our legislation undermines their negotiations on a global ban rather than a unilateral measure. 
Frankly, I don't think that he reflects the views of the President. I have to tell you that this is the most asinine comment issued by the administration yet on this issue. Why does the White House think a treaty banning these weapons is going to be signed in Ottawa this December? Countries are coming together to sign a treaty banning antipersonnel mines in Ottawa, not because of the United States or because of this administration's negotiating strategy; to the contrary, they are signing it in spite of the United States. While the United States has sat on the sidelines and forsaken the kind of moral leadership we can bring, dozens of other countries have taken strong, unilateral action by renouncing the use of these weapons and are pledging to sign a treaty in December. We showed great moral leadership on the Chemical Weapons Convention and on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. But, Mr. President, far, far more civilians have died or have been injured by landmines than nuclear weapons or chemical weapons. Every Member of this Senate who is a combat veteran from Vietnam is a cosponsor of this bill. 
I have more to say, but the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, my chief cosponsor, is on the floor. I yield the floor to Senator Hagel.

But I do want to note, this involves not just the Congress and other governments. Diana, Princess of Wales is in Washington today to support the efforts of the American Red Cross in raising money to aid the victims of landmines. I commend Elizabeth Dole, President of the American Red Cross, and the Princess, for doing that. The Princess has done so much, since she went to Angola and saw the terrible effects of landmines there, to call attention to the plight of the victims and to speak out in support of a global ban. What we all want to do, of course, is do everything possible to make sure that someday there will be no such victims. 
I yield to my good friend from Maine.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken on the floor many, many times about the pace of the Senate confirming judicial nominees. The distinguished Presiding Officer, my friend, has had to do double duty because he has had to listen to me do it in the Judiciary Committee, too, on occasion. I commend his equanimity and patience in listening to my remarks. 
Mr. President, I urge all Senators, Republican and Democrat alike, to move forward on the confirmation of judicial nominees. This weekend, on one of the ubiquitous television talk shows, the distinguished majority leader said he intended to block action on all nominations except military nominees until President Clinton fills four seats on the Federal Election Commission. The distinguished majority leader, of course, has the right and power to control the calendar of the Senate. I have no question about that. But I hope he would reconsider this policy for all nominees, but especially for the Federal judiciary. 
The distinguished majority leader has a concern with the President on the FEC. I am not going to get in the middle of that issue. Both sides claim they are moving forward with nominees. I have to assume the majority leader of the U.S. Senate has ways of bringing pressure to bear on the President of the United States without having to cripple the Federal judiciary or to do things that might appear, whether intended or not, to diminish the independence of the Federal judiciary. 
For example, we have four noncontroversial nominees at the moment in the Federal circuit and district courts. They should not get delayed in this political squabble. They enjoy strong bipartisan support. They were unanimously reported to the full Senate by the Judiciary Committee with all Democrats and all Republicans on that committee voting for them. More importantly, they are desperately needed in the courts which they have been nominated. 
Let me give an example. Alan Gold has been nominated to be a U.S. district court judge for the southern district of Florida. Now, this is a noncontroversial nominee but it is also one desperately needed. He is an extremely well qualified nominee. The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination last month, and the Southern District Court of Florida desperately needs him to help manage its growing backlog of cases. This is in a district that has one of the fastest-growing populations in this country. In fact, during his confirmation hearing, the distinguished Republican Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, told the Judiciary Committee, `This appointment comes at a critical time for south Florida. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Lenz versus Mathis has resulted in the early release of hundreds of violent criminals back on the streets and brought about a crisis of confidence in the safety of our neighborhood. This unsettling feeling made it especially critical for South Florida to have a full complement of the judges administering the laws to fight violent crime.' 
We first received Alan Gold's nomination in February of this year. The President nominated him for a vacancy on the district court for the southern district of Florida. This vacancy existed since shortly after the elections last year. He has the support of both Senator Graham and Senator Mack. 
He had a hearing on May 7. The Judiciary Committee reported his confirmation to the full Senate on May 22. This is the way the judicial confirmation process should work. The position had been open only a few months. The Senate was out at the time the vacancy occurred. Shortly after the elections, the President moved quickly with a nominee that had strong bipartisan support for his home State senators. The Judiciary Committee moved very quickly, 
and the nomination passed out unanimously. We know that there is a major need for a judge there. Alan Gold's nomination is now pending on the Senate calendar, awaiting action on the Senate floor. This process should not become entangled in partisan squabbling. 
Instead, we should look at the one branch of our Government that is supposed to be nonpartisan--the judiciary--and not allow the Federal judiciary to be caught up in partisan squabbling of Senators or with the White House. We should move this nomination through the Senate very quickly. 
Another example of a judicial nomination that we should move quickly is in the northern district of Georgia, where Thomas Thrash, Jr., has been nominated to be a U.S. district judge. We unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate last month, on May 22. But this is also a district--the northern district of Georgia--there in the eleventh circuit that desperately needs Thomas Thrash to help manage a growing backlog of cases. 
Now, we received his nomination in May 1996--over a year ago. He was accorded a hearing last Congress, on July 31, 1996. But his nomination got caught in the election year freeze, which said we will not move nominations after a certain time in a Presidential election year. The President nominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy. That vacancy has existed since March of 1996, for over a year. He had a confirmation hearing on May 7. He was supported by both Senator Cleland and Senator Coverdell, one Democrat and one Republican from Georgia, and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks later. Now, this is not a case that should be held up because of a partisan squabble. 
Also pending on the calendar is Eric Clay to be a circuit judge for the sixth circuit, another noncontroversial, well-qualified nominee. The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on May 22 of this year. Now, the sixth circuit desperately needs help in managing a growing backlog of cases. They have three vacancies, two of which have been designated judicial emergencies by the Judicial Conference of the United States. I mention the judicial emergencies, Mr. President, because this is not a case of some mere debating point; this is the Federal judiciary of this country with emergencies, where they need judges, where we could confirm the judges, and, frankly, the U.S. Senate is not doing its job. 
We first received Eric Clay's nomination in March 1996. He was accorded a hearing on March 26, 1996. He was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate on April 25, 1996. And now, more than a year later, we are still waiting for him to be confirmed. Now, Eric Clay has the strong support of both Senator Levin and Senator Abraham, one Republican and one Democrat. We ought to confirm this judge for the sixth circuit. 
We also have Arthur Gajarsa's nomination to be U.S. circuit judge for the Federal circuit on the calendar. We first received his nomination in April--not April 1997, but April 1996. His nomination was passed unanimously by the Judiciary Committee back in June of last year. Now he is back here again, passed unanimously again. He ought to be confirmed quickly. 
We also have the nomination of Margaret Morrow for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on the Senate calendar. She is another well-qualified nominee. Ms. Morrow is the first woman president of the California Bar Association and the Judiciary Committee unanimously approved her nomination last year, but her confirmation got caught up in the election year stall on judicial confirmations. Just last week, the Judiciary Committee again approved her nomination. The Senate should quickly take action on the nomination of Margaret Morrow. 
We have confirmed less than one judge a month since the start of this session in January. We have almost 100 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. Many of them are in critical areas, where huge backlogs are occurring, where courts are saying that we are benefiting criminals because they can't be tried; we can't have 
speedy trials. Criminals get the benefit of this by not having judges to hear the cases. If you have a civil case, forget about a speedy trial. 
I just look at some of the headlines we have had recently seen, which are shown on this chart. One is by the Washington Post, by Sue Anne Pressley: `Cases Pile Up as Judgeships Remain Vacant; Drug Crackdown, Immigration Inundate U.S. Courts in Texas.' Apparently, you can be on the southern border of this country and have drug and immigration cases in major courts that can't be heard because you can't get enough judges there. 
Bruce Fein is one who has written primarily from a conservative viewpoint. His column: `Judge Not.' It speaks of the independent Federal judiciary. He says, `The supreme jewel of our Constitution is a fiercely independent Federal judiciary, but congressional Republicans are attacking this gem.' 
We have a couple of editorials on the Chief Justice--one from the Washington Post and one from the New York Times--speaking of the alert from the Chief Justice: `A Reminder From the Chief Justice.' These are the cases where the Chief Justice of this country--another conservative Republican--has said, `We have a crisis situation; let's move on it.' 
We have one entitled, `The GOP Hold on Judgeships; Partisan Politics Have Ground Confirmations to a Halt.' 
Now, I say this, Mr. President--I make the same argument now as when we have had a Republican President and a Democratically controlled Senate. If there is one area where partisan politics should not be allowed, it is in the area of the Federal judiciary. 
One thing that sets our country apart from virtually all others is the independence of our Federal judiciary. Every country that in this century has moved toward democracy has sent observers to the United States of America to look at our Federal judiciary and they say, `How do you have such an independent judiciary?' Look what is happening in countries that are sometimes lurching into democracy. They say the one thing that holds them back, that allows crime to continue, that allows an economic system to break down, that allows graft and corruption to occur in each of those countries is because their judiciary cannot be truly independent. In our country, our Federal judiciary is truly independent. 
Now, each one of us, I would gather, on this floor at some time or another has disagreed with a decision of a Federal judge, for different reasons. Each one of us, I would be willing to guess, has to thank God we have an independent Federal judiciary and that we can't stand up and tell the judge how to rule. I know that when I argued cases before Federal courts, I used to sit there knowing they were going to be independent, knowing that I might win and I might lose. I would make my best argument, and it would go from there. That is the way it should be. 
What I worry about, Mr. President, is that if we allow the Federal judiciary to be caught up in partisan moves, where one side tries to get advantage over the other, while one side or the other might win in the short term, all of us as Americans are damaged because our Federal judiciary is damaged. Every one of us--Republican or Democrat--should know if we look at history, read history, and if we understand history, that one of the reasons we are the greatest democracy history has ever known is because of our independent Federal judiciary. We should never allow anything to happen to cut back on that independence. 
I have never seen anything like this current stall in the judicial confirmation process in almost 23 years in the U.S. Senate. I came here in 1974, in one of the largest classes of this Senate. In fact, I today stand here as the only one who has not announced retirement or left. But I think all the way through that, working with some of the finest men and women I have ever known in both parties--and we have had fights, partisan fights, saying that we should do this farm bill this way or this farm bill that way, or this highway bill this way or that way, or the crime bill this way or that way--we fought it out and we have had the votes and one side or the other wins, and the President either 
signs it or not. We have done this on foreign policy issues and on all others. But the one area that we have tried to protect from partisan squabbles has been the area of the Federal judiciary. 
We know that whoever is President is going to have the greatest influence of all of us on who is going to be a Federal judge. President Reagan made it very clear when he ran for President, for example, who he would appoint as Federal judges. A lot of these Federal judges are not the men and women I would have appointed from that circuit or that district. But I voted for all of them because they were honest people, people of integrity, people of confidence, and people I could look at and say, although I might have disagreed with their political background, I know that, as a litigant, if I came before his or her court, I could expect an honest treatment. 
President Bush had other ideas who should be there, as President Carter and President Ford did. These are all Presidents I have served with. President Clinton now has his ideas. 
Now, the interesting thing, President Ford was appointed, but these others, in every election, at some point during the campaign, it became an issue as to who will this Presidential candidate appoint to the Federal judiciary. And the American people examined their views and they elected President Carter, President Reagan, President Ford, and President Clinton.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we live, unfortunately, in a partisan time. I have never seen either the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives tied up in such partisan knots. I find that it is personally distressing to me. I have enormous respect for the U.S. Senate and enormous respect for the House of Representatives. 
I have felt it a great privilege to serve with distinguished Republican and Democrat leaders of both the House and the Senate. I think I have been a personal friend of nearly every leader in the House and the Senate in both parties. And I have considered that as one of the great joys of serving in the U.S. Senate. I can think of a number of times I have joined with Members of both parties to push difficult legislation through. The last farm bill was an example when it was completely tied up. Then it became the Lugar-Leahy-Dole farm bill and passed this Senate with the highest number of votes which I believe a farm bill had ever passed before. The next closest one was probably the Lugar-Leahy farm bill of 5 years before. 
I am not suggesting that the two parties hold hands on every issue by any means. I don't think that would serve the country well. But there are certain issues where we come together for the country. We have done this on major foreign policy issues. We have done it at times when this country desperately needed it. We did it recently on the budget agreement. 
Mr. President, each one of us should search our souls and ask whether the country is well served by the bitterness that has gone on in some of the partisanship, by the personal attacks against each other and against the institution that we should be proud to serve, or the attacks against the President that have become so personal. 
We should ask ourselves if we benefit this great Nation that we are privileged to serve if we diminish and chip away and even destroy some of the independence of our Federal judiciary because, if we do that, Mr. President, some day we will no longer be here. Nobody holds a seat in the U.S. Senate. The distinguished Presiding Officer will leave sometime, and the Senator from Vermont will leave the U.S. Senate sometime. All of us will. 
But when we leave, we should look back, and ask, `What did we do here? What mark in history did we leave?' If we have left as our mark that we made the Government better, that we made the Senate better, that we made the Congress better, that we protected the institutions of our Government, that we protected the people of our democracy, then we can go home knowing that we served our Nation well. 
But we should ask ourselves, each and every one, if we leave here and say that as a result of our partisanship on either side of the aisle that the Federal judiciary was diminished--one of the great institutions of this country, one of the reasons we have remained a democracy, one of the things which guaranteed our diversity, which allows the most powerful nation that history has ever known to be a democracy and not a dictatorship--then we cannot feel that we have served our Nation well. We cannot feel that we can be proud of our time in the U.S. Senate. 
So I urge Senators to think about this story. I realize that we are in a different time--and I am reminded that I have spoken before on the floor of the Senate about the experience my father had in Vermont in 1937, 3 years before I was born. Vermont was one of the most Republican States back in 1936 in the Roosevelt great landslide. Alf Landon--the distinguished father of our distinguished former colleague, Senator Kassebaum--Alf Landon carried two States: Maine and Vermont. 
And the head of our largest insurance company, the National Life Insurance Co., basically the titular head of the Republican Party, was standing next to my father on State Street in Montpelier, VT, as President Roosevelt was making a visit to Vermont and went by in an open car. The president of the National Life Insurance Co. stood at attention and took off his hat--all men wore hats at that time--and he held it over his heart as President Roosevelt's car went by. My dad said, `I can't believe you took off your hat for Franklin Roosevelt.' He looked with arched concern at my father and said, `Howard, I took off my hat for the President of the United States, not for Franklin Roosevelt.' 
I have disagreed with Presidents of both parties since I have been here. I have agreed with President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton. I have voted with each of these President's on occasions. I have voted against them on occasions. I felt it a privilege to meet with them and argue with them. I stated my position as clearly as I could, but always respectfully because of the office that they held--the same way those of us who have been lawyers, who have practiced, know the respect that we hold for the courts that we enter. We all rise. We say `Your Honor,' and so forth. We have done this not because we felt that every judge that ever appeared before us was the most brilliant person we have ever known, but we have done it because we know this is an institution that must be protected for the sake of our country. Our State courts must be protected for the sake of our States because without an independent judiciary, then our system of government all breaks down. 
We looked, following the tragedy of Oklahoma City, at the trial that has just been completed, looked at a judge who commanded the respect of that courtroom. Both sides--the prosecution and the defense--knew the judge who ran that case. I contrast that to a case of a year ago where a judge allowed the case to just fall apart, and how much that damaged our judicial system. Then we go back to the Federal court and see a judge who knows that both sides will have their opportunity and their rights protected, and they will try this case. The lawyers on both sides knew and respected the Federal court. They knew that this was a case that would be handled under our judicial system, even one involving one of the most horrible acts, certainly the most horrible domestic act of my lifetime, and one of the most horrible domestic acts of this Nation's history. But because we can count on the Federal court, the whole Nation could watch, the whole Nation feeling the anguish that we all felt that terrible day in Oklahoma City. We could watch that court and know that our system works, that we could trust that system, because all of us--the distinguished Presiding Officer, myself, and every one of us who--have always protected the integrity of our courts. 
Let us not do anything as Senators, for whatever short-term political gain, to tear apart the integrity of our courts. Let us work together and call on the distinguished majority leader, and those who make the decision of when these judges can come up, to work with all of us, not as Democrats nor as Republicans but as U.S. Senators, doing what is best for this Nation, what is best for our judiciary, what is best for our democracy, and what is best for the independence of our judiciary that has made us the great Nation that we are. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, with 56 cosponsors--Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals, men and women--to ban new deployments of antipersonnel landmines beginning in the year 2000. 
I am honored to be joined by Senator Chuck Hagel, who was injured by landmines in Vietnam, and who is the chief cosponsor of this bill. 
I also want to give special thanks to Senators Bob Kerrey and John McCain, both decorated Vietnam veterans, who are cosponsors of this bill and know far better than I about the terror landmines inflict on our own soldiers. In and out of Congress, those who know these weapons best, hate them most. 
Landmines have some marginal military value. So, for that matter, do chemical weapons. But the damage done by these hidden killers long after the guns fall silent and the armies have gone home far outweigh whatever small benefits they add to our enormous and unsurpassed military arsenal. 
The victims are not only innocent civilians. There were more than 64,000 American casualties from landmines in Vietnam. If that is not appalling enough, the overwhelming majority of those mines contained U.S. components. They 
were made here, and they killed and maimed our soldiers half-way around the world. 
In Bosnia, more than 250 soldiers under U.N. and NATO commands have been injured, and 29 killed, by landmines. Every American casualty from enemy causes in Bosnia has been from landmines. 
And that does not include the thousands of civilians who have fallen victim to these indiscriminate weapons, and the thousands more who will lose their legs, their arms, their eyesight and their lives in the future. For some 68 countries, the bridge to the 21st century is strewn and landmines. 100 million of them. 
The purpose of this legislation is to exert U.S. leadership. But what we propose here is no different, indeed it does not go as far, as what others have already done. Great Britain, Canada, Germany, South Africa are some of the countries who have unilaterally renounced their production, use, and export of these weapons, and are destroying their stockpiles. 
Some 72 nations have said they will meet in Ottawa this December to sign a treaty banning the weapons, and I suspect that number will continue to climb. Our country has not said if we will go to Ottawa. Why is this administration--which showed such moral leadership on chemical weapons to isolate the rogue nations--putting the United States in the role of a helpless giant when it comes to antipersonnel landmines? Why can we not use that same moral suasion, as others have done? We are not a pariah nation, and we should not act like one. 
The United States shows leadership worthy of a great and powerful nation when we are bold on a practical and moral issue like this. We squander that potential and are no different from other nations when we sit on the sidelines, as the administration has done here. 
For the past 5 years, the leadership on banning landmines has come from Congress. I hope the President will step forward to move the United States into the front ranks of this global effort, along with Canada and our other allies. 
Before some in the Pentagon start drumming up opposition to this bill, I would urge them to consider who is supporting it, and why we support it. Every Member of the Senate who has seen combat is a cosponsor of this bill. This is not about taking away a weapon the Pentagon needs. It is about beginning the next century by renouncing a weapon that does not belong in the arsenal of civilized nations. The Pentagon has far more to gain if the use of antipersonnel landmines is made a war crime. 
Finally, to those in the Pentagon who say that so-called smart mines--that are designed to self-destruct automatically--are the solution to this problem, I challenge them to find me a landmine that is smart enough to tell the difference between a soldier and a child. And let us not fool ourselves--the rest of the world does not use self-destruct mines, and they are not going to. They are not going to feel pressured to give up their mines, if we refuse to renounce smart mines. We saw that with chemical weapons, and with the nuclear test ban. There is no substitute for U.S. leadership. 
I recognize that the Pentagon may be institutionally incapable of giving up a weapon that has some value, however marginal. Their job is to protect American soldiers, and there are undoubtedly instances when antipersonnel landmines have done that. But they should consider the horrendous casualties these weapons have inflicted on our troops. And they should recognize that just because a weapon has some marginal value does not justify its use when the victims are overwhelmingly innocent civilians, indeed whole societies. 
Ultimately, it is a political decision, and the President, as Commander in Chief, needs to act. The question no longer is whether we will ban antipersonnel landmines, but when. This bill moves us closer to that goal. 
There is only one way to stop this, and that is to stop it. And the sooner the United States does that, as others have done, the sooner the world can sweep these weapons into the dustbin of history.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently received a letter that remarked upon the bravery and fortitude of a former U.S. Coast Guard member, Mark D. Chamberlain. 
On a chilly, rainy winter day, three generations of the Chamberlain family, Dale, Mark, and Justin set out on snowshoes in a wooded area of Lyndonville, VT. After 5 hours of trekking in the woods, the eldest Chamberlain, Dale, attempted to forge an ice-covered river when the ice gave way and dragged him under. Mark, his son, managed to grab a hold of his coat and pull him back to safety amid the chunks of ice and strong river currents. Despite the fact that Dale was numb with cold, Mark assured his father that he would be fine and convinced him to begin walking. Mark led the party back to their vehicle and the three Chamberlains returned safely to the warmth of their home. 
Mark Chamberlain, not only set an heroic example for his son, Justin, to admire and follow, he also demonstrated the strength of the bonds that tie families together. 
Mr. President, I ask that an article about this experience which appeared in the Caledonian-Record be reprinted in the Congressional Record.

Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we are now at the end of May. We have confirmed a grand total of two judges in this session. If we confirm these, it will make five, one a month, which is zero population growth in the Federal judiciary. 
I will not ask for a rollcall, but we have been told over and over again these were all being held up so we could have rollcalls on them. I suspect we will not have them because it will be embarrassing to see that three excellent, well-qualified judges, held up all this time, then would get voted on virtually unanimously. 
I will also note Margaret Morrow, the one woman who was on the panel on this, still is not before the Senate and still is being held for mysterious holds on the Republican side. 
I urge my good friend, the majority leader--and he is my good friend--I urge him to do this. I have been here 22 years with outstanding majority leaders, Republicans and Democrats, with Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole, and Senator Mitchell as majority leaders. And now I have the opportunity to serve with the distinguished Senator from Mississippi as the majority leader. 
No majority leader has ever allowed the Senate before to do what is happening to the Federal judiciary now. I urge my friend from Mississippi not to allow this Senate to be the first Senate that acts toward the Federal judiciary or diminishes the integrity and the independence of our Federal judiciary, the integrity and independence recognized and commended and praised throughout the world, to let it be diminished here. 
I urge the distinguished majority leader to work with the distinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, and myself and others, to move these judges. We have 100 vacancies. We have 25 to 28 sitting before the committee that could go immediately, or nearly immediately. We have to do this and stop--stop--the 
belittling and diminishing of our Federal judiciary. It is part of what makes this a great democracy. We should not allow it to happen. 
I will not object to the request of the distinguished majority leader.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Robert W. Pratt to be a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa. Mr. Pratt is a well-qualified nominee. 
We first received Robert Pratt's nomination in August 1996. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress and the President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. He had a confirmation hearing on March 18 where he was supported by Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee on April 17, more than 4 weeks ago. 
With this confirmation the Senate has confirmed five Federal judges in five months--one Federal judge a month. Even with the three judicial confirmation votes today, there are still almost 100 judicial vacancies in the Federal courts. Since this session began, vacancies on the Federal bench have increased from 87 to 103 and we have proceeded to confirm only five nominees. After these three confirmations, after more than doubling our confirmation output for the entire year in this one afternoon, we still face 98 current vacancies today and that number is continuing to grow. At this rate, we are falling farther and farther behind and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of more Americans and the national cause of prompt justice.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Donald M. Middlebrooks to be a U.S. District Judge for the southern district of Florida. Mr. Middlebrooks is a well-qualified nominee. 
The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his judicial nomination to the full Senate more than 4 weeks ago. The southern district of Florida desperately needs him to manage is growing backlog of cases. 
We first received Donald Middlebrooks' nomination in September 1996. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress and the President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the district court for the southern district of Florida, which vacancy has existed since October 1992. This is another of the judicial emergency vacancies that we did not fill last year. It has been vacant for more than 4 1/2 years. He has the support of both Senator Graham and Senator Mack and was reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate on April 17. 
With this confirmation, the Senate has confirmed three Federal judges this year--the same amount of times we have gone on vacation in 1997. At this rate, we are falling farther and farther behind and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of more Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. We must do better. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with the chairman and other members of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to move the nominations process forward so that the Senate confirms the judges that the Federal courts need to ensure the prompt administration of justice.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Jeffrey T. Miller to be a U.S. district court judge for the southern district of California. Judge Miller is a well-qualified nominee. 
The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate more than 4 weeks ago. The southern district of California desperately needs Judge Miller to help manage its growing backlog of cases. 
We first received Judge Jeffrey Miller's nomination in July 1996. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress and the President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the district court for the southern district of California, which vacancy has existed since December 1994. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies that we should have filled last year. This vacancy has persisted for 2 1/2 years. He has the support of both Senators from California. He had a confirmation hearing on March 18 and his nomination was considered and reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee on April 17. 
With this confirmation, the Senate has confirmed four Federal judges this year--the same number as the number of amendments to the Constitution that have been considered and defeated by the House of Representatives and the Senate. At this rate, we are falling farther and farther behind and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of more Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. We must do better.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention was initiated by President Reagan, negotiated by President Bush and ratified on behalf of the United States by President Clinton. The ratification of this convention was a major achievement that consumed a great deal of the time and attention of the Senate. 
When the Senate gave its advise and consent to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the administration told us it was imperative that we act on implementing legislation as quickly as possible. The Judiciary Committee had the task of reporting back to the Senate with implementing legislation in time for Senate consideration before our Memorial Day recess. 
The implementing legislation considered by the Senate today is where the rubber meets the road. It will define precisely how the general obligations of the international treaty will affect American citizens and American chemical companies. 
A significant principle of the convention is set forth in Article VII regarding `National Implementation Measures.' This principle makes clear that each state party shall, in accordance with its constitutional processes, adopt the necessary measures to implement its obligations under this convention. My objective when I began work on this legislation was to make sure that it reflected our constitutional principles and sound public policy, while fulfilling our obligations under the convention. 
Over the last few weeks, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing, solicited the advice of experts from both the administration and in the private sector, and worked to craft legislation we could report to the Senate in a very short time frame. I commend my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, and especially Chairman Hatch, Senator Biden, and Senator Kyl, for their diligence and efforts in fulfilling this Committee's responsibilities. Senator Lugar deserves enormous credit for his constructive and helpful work in reaching the compromises necessary to get this legislation done. 
I also thank Ivo Spalatin, Dave Barton, and Bernie Sewart, from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; Bill Danvers and Gordy Bendick, from the National Security Council; Steven Goldman and Ann Connaughton from the Department of Commerce; Eileen Gillio from the Department of Defense; and Craig Iscoe from the Department of Justice. These dedicated employees from Federal agencies and the White House spent hours, even late into the night, to share their expertise with the committee. We appreciate their hard work. 
The hearing we held on May 13, 1997, regarding the administration's implementing legislation, S. 610, raised a number of issues that needed to be addressed. For example, one aspect of S.610 that required our attention was its blanket exception from the Freedom of Information Act for all information reported to, or otherwise obtained by any of the agencies involved in implementing the convention. 
Even a witness from the Department of Justice admitted that this provision was not intended, for example, to limit public access to records concerning the number of inspections conducted under the convention, even if that information was reported to, or otherwise obtained by the U.S. National Authority from the Technical Secretariat. He agreed that this provision could be clarified. 
The committee amendment to S.610 substantially improves this aspect of the legislation by removing the blanket exception under the Freedom of Information Act contained in the original bill. The substitute retains protection for trade secrets and other proprietary business information provided under the act and the convention, but the operations of the Federal agencies in implementing this act will not be cloaked in secrecy. They will be fully subject to the FOIA--as they should be. 
Yet another provision in S.610, as introduced, could have been construed to penalize a person for refusing to consent to an entry or inspection required under the convention. A Justice Department witness testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing that this section is inelegant and fails to account for the process agreed to in the conditions of ratification. The implementing legislation reported by the committee clarifies this provision, and affirms the constitutional right of every American to refuse to give their consent to a search and the requirement that the Government obtain a warrant. 
We also heard from several witnesses about including in the implementing legislation a mechanism to compensate those companies that suffer a loss of trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information due to their compliance with the convention. The implementing legislation we reported out of the Judiciary Committee provides a compensation scheme that I sincerely hope will not become a surer bet than the lottery for a payout to companys subject to the convention. This scheme will, after the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, shift the burden to the Government to prove that any loss did not arise from the company's compliance with the convention. Proving a negative will be no easy task for the Government, which may legitimately decide simply to settle such claims, despite their lack of merit. We may have to revisit this scheme if it proves to be authorization for a legal holdup of the U.S. Treasury. 
Other provisions in this implementing legislation also give me pause. It does not reflect all the changes each of us would like in the exact form we would like them. But it certainly reflects good faith compromises on both sides.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee can stay on the floor just for a moment because I intend to refer to some of the things he has said. 
To begin with, the distinguished chairman is a close personal friend of mine, not the least of which I find that, as a Grateful Dead fan of long standing, I enjoy his gospel music. So we do have some areas that join us. 
I must take exception to some of the remarks he has made about Federal judges. He mentioned that none had been rejected on the floor. Well, of course they have. We have had the average of one a month. At this rate, with 100 vacancies, it is zero population growth in the Federal judiciary. President Clinton will not be in office long enough nor will the next two Presidents, to see all these vacancies filled--not if you do one a month. 
When he says none have been rejected on the floor, that is because these are extraordinarily well-qualified people and they are going to be voted for on this floor. In fact, even Merrick Garland they held up for so long. When Judge Garland came here, some people--for whatever reasons, ideological or whatever--voted against him, but not one person suggested he was not extraordinarily well qualified; in fact, one of the best qualified judges we have seen in years. In fact, even some who voted against him commended his qualifications. So it became just a political, partisan thing. 
I suspect that the 27 judges that are being held in limbo or in the prison of the Senate Judiciary Committee, if they had a fair vote on this floor, would all be confirmed overwhelmingly because Senators would not want to have to go back to their State and try to explain to people why, other than for purely partisan motives, they voted against some of these judges. 
So, how do you defeat the judges? You make sure they never come forward. I will give you an example--Margaret Morrow. Margaret Morrow came before our committee last year. She had to go through all the usual and appropriate confirmation hearings, and she was voted out of the committee unanimously, but somehow they made sure she never came to the floor for a vote. 
So this year Margaret Morrow was brought back again and told she was going to be put in her place. All the men who were candidates for the Federal judiciary were brought up first and she was told to sit there--although she had been here once before and unanimously confirmed, she was told to sit there in the back of the room waiting for the others to be confirmed or to be heard. 
Now, I keep bringing this issue up at the Judiciary Committee meeting, and I am told there are no objections to her, but somehow she is never brought forward to be voted on. I keep saying, if Senators want to vote against her, stand up, have the guts to stand up in the bright sunshine and say how they would vote on her, but nobody does, nobody does. 
She was asked such questions as how she votes. There were over 100 initial questions before it became too embarrassing, and then how did she vote on initiatives in California. I raise the question, and I hope that all Senators, Republicans and Democrats, would agree with me on this, that the Senate demeans itself if it starts asking people how they voted in the secrecy of the voting booth. I would never allow somebody to ask me how I voted unless I really wanted to tell how I voted in the secrecy of the voting booth. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia would not allow that. The distinguished Senator from Utah would not allow that. And I suspect the Senator who asked the question would not allow it of himself. She is supported by the Republican mayor of Los Angeles. She is supported by significant Republicans and Democrats in California. She was the president of the California Bar Association, the first woman ever elected to that position--the president of the Los Angeles Bar Association--but somehow she does not come on to the floor. 
I suspect that if she was brought for a vote, she would win overwhelmingly. She would win with 90 votes in the Senate, at least, but apparently she loses with one vote of an anonymous Senator who hides behind a veil of secrecy and will not tell us why he or she is holding her up. 
Now, is this full employment of the Federal judiciary? Not according to the Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist. Chief Justice Rehnquist says the situation is bleak --not full employment, but bleak. 
We have emergencies existing. The ninth circuit has a quarter to a third of all judges missing. Will the White House have more judges coming up? Of course they will. But do not blame the White House; blame the U.S. Senate. We have had more vacations and recesses in the Senate than we have had judges. We ought to at least do the job we are paid to do. 
Of course, I agree with the distinguished Senator from Utah that we should scrutinize all judges. We can do that, but do it, and then get on with our work. We get paid plenty. We ought to do it. 
What I see happening, Mr. President, when you have a Congressman from Texas who says that judges should be impeached because he, the Congressman, happens to disagree with their decisions--Mr. President, I read the Constitution. I have my own copy, supplied to me by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, and I say to my friend from West Virginia that I looked through that copy and I found grounds of impeachment--high crimes and misdemeanors. I did not find grounds of impeachment that you annoyed a Congressman from Texas or anywhere else. 
I do not think that was ever contemplated by the Founders, I say to my good friend. But this is the kind of ridiculous thing we have, all of which is aimed at going against the independence of the Federal judiciary. 
We had somebody else who proposed the Congress have the ability to stand up and vote to override any judicial decision. What does that do to the independence and what does it have to do with our workload? Here it is May 23, and we are finally passing the budget that the law requires us to pass on April 15. Can you imagine if we had to then vote on several thousand judicial decisions each year? This is what we are hearing. Again, a conservative Republican Justice, Justice Scalia, says this is going too far. I agree with him. 
As I said earlier to the distinguished Republican leader--I was on the floor--I hope that he would work to see this does not continue. Majority leaders of the Senate, the 22 years I have been here, Senators Mansfield, Byrd, Baker, Dole and Mitchell, all great leaders, all leaders who said there are certain things where partisanship has to end. The President of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to appoint judges. We advise and consent. We are not the appointers of judges. He is. We can recommend, we can advise and we can consent. But once he has appointed them, then if we do not like them, vote them down. But do not take on the pride of 100 Senators around here. 
I suspect, regarding the press accounts, that the distinguished Senator from Utah has certain restraints from within his own caucus. I understand that. But I urge this. We are going to go out of session now for 10 days or so, a week, whatever it is. I urge, as I have before, that the distinguished majority leader, the distinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished Senator from Utah and I sit down and try to find if there is a way to start moving these judges from the Senate, and from the Senate end how we can move faster. If people do not like them, vote against them, but do not hold them in limbo; and then I suggest we meet with the President of the United States.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator Lautenberg's legislation, the War Crimes Prosecution Facilitation Act of 1997. 
Senator Lautenberg has consistently called for stronger action to bring war crimes in the former Yugoslavia to justice, and I appreciate his efforts and commend him for keeping the spotlight on this. 
I am not going to repeat what Senator Lautenberg has already said about why this legislation is needed. He has discussed it in detail. It is simply outrageous that people who are believed to be responsible for some of the most heinous crimes in this century have been living and traveling freely within the former Yugoslavia, their whereabouts a matter of public knowledge. 
My own view is that NATO forces, or some special contingent specifically constituted to capture war criminals, should go after these people. The longer we wait, the more powerless NATO appears, and the more convinced these people are that they have nothing to fear. But until that happens, at the very least, we should not give aid to governments that harbor war criminals, especially considering that they pledged to cooperate fully with the War Crimes Tribunal. 
That is the purpose of this legislation--to deny aid to governments of the former Yugoslavia until they arrest and turn over indicted war criminals who are within territory under that control, or to projects in communities whose local authorities are protecting war criminals or preventing refugees from returning home. Frankly, that should already be U.S. Government policy. There should be no need for this legislation. Since our goal is to promote reconciliation, the bill does make appropriate exceptions for humanitarian and other limited assistance. 
Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator Lautenberg for his leadership, I hope that the administration will respond by telling us that they are in agreement with this legislation and will conform their policy accordingly.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to something that is going on at the Environmental Protection Agency that is of great concern to many of our House and Senate colleagues, and to myself. For the past year, I have been working with the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House and now, the Science Advisory Board, to release a 1,700-page report on the sources, health risks, and control measure for mercury pollution in our country. This report is the best and most complete assemblage of state-of-the-art information to date on the sources and health effects of mercury pollution. It has undergone extensive internal and external peer review. American taxpayers have already paid more than $1 million in contract dollars and for more than 25,000 hours of staff time to develop this report. Had the report been submitted to the Congress when it was effectively completed roughly 17 months ago, the information it contains would have been available to the public and for use by State and Federal decisionmakers. 
Because of the widespread public and congressional concern over the health and environmental effects of mercury pollution, the 1990 Clean Air amendments required the EPA to conduct a study of mercury and submit that study to Congress by November 1994. Instead, the EPA submitted the report to the Science Advisory Board for review because new studies are expected to be published over the next 2 years. Well, as we all know, one thing you can be sure of in this world is that researchers will continue to research; there will always be new studies, and this is as it should be. We need sound science to make public policy decisions. But we also need up-to-date science, and that is what this report offers. As time passes, the information contained in the report becomes increasingly less useful for regulatory and judicial decisions. 
Mercury poses a serious and growing public health and environmental threat to our Nation. Thirty-seven States have issued human health consumption advisories because of unacceptable levels of mercury in freshwater fish. According to EPA estimates, as many as 85,000 pregnant women are exposed to mercury levels high enough to produce risks to their children. Yet many States cannot identify the sources and quantities of this pollutant or address the problems that arise both within and outside State borders. 
We Vermonters are deeply concerned about what is being transported by air currents across our borders. Acid rain taught us that our tough laws on the environment were not enough to protect us. We could be affected from other areas of the country whose environmental standards may not be as high as our own. Yet despite these standards, Vermont and other States have become a dumping ground. We saw some of our healthiest forests die off from pollution that came from outside our region. Unlike the many compounds causing acid rain, mercury does not break down. It circulates through the environment. It is not going to go away when we turn off the tap. It will settle in the lakes, streams, and soils of those States that were also the dumping ground for acid rain. 
The public has a right to this report and the States need it to make sensible decisions about reducing mercury in the environment. Instead, it has been sitting on the shelf for nearly 2 years now. By holding back the mercury report, the administration is denying to Federal and State regulatory bodies and to the public information that will be critical to the revision of health advisories, air pollution measures, and utility restructuring proposals. But releasing the report is only the first step in addressing mercury pollution. The concurrent resolution I am submitting today also addresses the need to reduce mercury releases into the environment. 
One major source of mercury is municipal waste due to the disposal of mercury-containing lamps. EPA has proposed a rule to either exempt mercury-containing lamps from hazardous waste regulations or to include them in the universal waste rule, but EPA has made little progress since 1995. Exempting mercury-containing lamps from the hazardous waste rule would allow more than 500 million lamps to be deposited in solid waste landfills or conveyed to waste incinerators, perpetuating the uncontrolled release of mercury into the environment. In Vermont, we are building a recycling industry to collect mercury-containing lamps. We are trying to keep mercury out of our waste stream. Without a Federal effort to encourage the same preventive steps in other States, this effort will be for naught. By including mercury-containing lamps in the universal waste rule, we would encourage recycling and the elimination of these products from the municipal solid waste stream. 
Another integral step in addressing mercury pollution is development of a better inventory of mercury emissions. One of the recommendations of the mercury report is to acquire test data on notable sources of mercury. My concurrent resolution calls upon EPA to begin landfill testing in pilot sites across the country. Several States have already expressed an interest in testing, and Florida has already begun testing at landfills. The only testing conducted at the Federal level was in New York City where two studies raised contradictory findings. In a 1994 Minnesota study, more than 10 percent of the overall emissions of mercury were attributed to landfills. We need to verify these initial findings through a national pilot program. Unfortunately, the 1,700-page mercury report does not include an examination of landfills. 
It is my hope that by releasing the mercury report, promulgating regulations on disposal of mercury-containing lamps and testing for mercury emissions, we will lay the groundwork for the long-overdue reduction of mercury from several sources. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Wellstone, Jeffords, Levin, Moynihan, Feingold, and Dodd, in submitted this Senate concurrent resolution. I hope that this resolution will draw to this issue the attention not only of the Senate, but also of the administration.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the House Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives for their consideration and passage of H.R. 911, the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. 
At the beginning of this month, the senior Senator from Georgia and I worked out a compromise version of the Volunteer Protection Act, S. 543. Our bipartisan legislation extended reasonable liability protection to individual volunteers for honest mistakes with no effect on liability of nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. The Coverdell-Leahy substitute offered liability protection for individuals who are volunteering to help others and acting in good faith and passed the Senate by a 99-1 vote. 
I am pleased that the House Judiciary Committee adopted the Coverdell-Leahy substitute version of the Volunteer Protection Act at its mark-up of H.R. 911. During its consideration of H.R. 911, the House Judiciary Committee adopted two amendments that improve our legislation. 
First, the House Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment by Representative Scott that applies the act's protection to conduct after the act's effective date. Prospective application makes sense since the act's passage will give notice to all parties of their new legal rights. 
Second, House Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment by Representative Jackson-Lee that exempts members of hate groups from the liability protections in the bill. Although I am not completely comfortable with the language of this amendment, its purpose is clear--to make sure that this legislation provides no protection whatsoever to anyone who is involved in a hate crime. I know that every one of my colleagues opposes hate groups and would not support liability protection for them and this amendment makes that explicitly clear. 
I recommend that my colleagues review the House Judiciary Committee report on H.R. 911, House Report 105-101, for a section-by-section analysis and summary of the bill. 
Although I support the Volunteer Protection Act, I realize that it is not perfect. I am troubled by its possible preemption of existing state law. While the bill's preemption provision has been significantly narrowed from the original version of S. 543, this legislation still preempts state laws that do not provide more protection for volunteers. If preemption occurs, State legislatures may pass legislation to opt out of the bill's coverage. 
Rather than preempting some State laws, I would prefer that Congress offer Federal incentives to States to enact model language for limiting volunteer liability. Many States have already acted on this issue with at least 44 States having passed some protection for volunteers. If we can achieve the shared objective of protecting individual volunteers without preempting State tort law, I think we should be pursuing that route. That approach, however, was not acceptable to the majority. 
I am also troubled by the manner that the Senate considered the Volunteer Protection Act. S. 543 was brought to the Senate floor without notice, without hearings and without a committee report. Although Senator Coverdell and I were able to work together to fashion a bipartisan bill, I believe that process would have been much easier had we gone through the normal process of considering the Volunteer Protection Act through the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. President, I share a profound sense of gratitude and appreciation for the thousands of Vermonters and millions of volunteers nationwide whose selfless acts make the world a better place for us all. The people who spend their weekends preparing dinners for the homeless and poor, the parents who organize a carwash to raise money for the local PTA, the neighbors who donate to those displaced by flood, fire and other disasters--these generous acts of voluntarism and countless others are an essential element of the American social fabric. 
The Presidents' Summit on America's Future last month in Philadelphia was a tribute to the spirit of American voluntarism and a magnifying glass that will help spark intensified efforts by all Americans to be better citizens and better neighbors; citizens who will be more willing to give of ourselves to make life better in our communities and nation. The events in Philadelphia were nonpartisan and inclusive of the interests of all. I am pleased that we in the Senate and House of Representatives were able to work in that spirit to craft bipartisan legislation that promotes the worthy goals of voluntarism in America. 
I believe we are building on the success of the Presidents' Summit on America's Future by working together to pass a good bill that provides volunteers involved in the delivery of needed services with reasonable liability protection. I urge my colleagues to support S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was profoundly disturbed to learn that the Palestinian Authority has adopted a policy that any Palestinian caught selling land to a Jew will receive the death penalty. Only days after the announcement, the New York Times reported the brutal abduction and murder of Mr. Farid Bashiti, a 70-year-old Palestinian real estate dealer who had been interrogated 2 weeks before his murder by the Palestinian police for allegedly selling land to Jews in and around Jerusalem. 
Palestinian authorities have denied any involvement in Mr. Bashiti's death, and I understand an investigation is underway by Palestinian and Israeli police. I do not seek to prejudge that. But it is noteworthy that Palestinian officials have not condemned his death and have openly called Mr. Bashiti a traitor. I hope that his family is able to learn the truth, and that those responsible are brought to justice. This was a horrendous crime whatever the motive, and whoever was behind it should be severely punished. 
But apart from Mr. Bashiti's murder, the policy of imposing a death sentence for the sale of land is nothing short of barbaric. It cannot be justified under any circumstances. I am very aware that Palestinians fervently disagree with the Israeli decision to proceed with the construction of Jewish housing in Har Homa. I disagree with that decision as well. And I am disturbed by the reports that torture is used by Israeli police. But executing someone because he or she sold land to Jews is beyond comprehension. 
Mr. President, I have spoken many times about the fragility of the peace process in the Middle East. I am very disappointed by any actions that exacerbate the situation, when the focus should be on easing tensions and seeking common ground.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for clarifying this point. With that clarification, I am prepared to support this bill. 
I join in supporting S. 476 to provide authority to expand Boys and Girls Clubs across the country, including both urban and rural areas. When we passed similar legislation last year, we did it as part of a legislative package that included the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act that Senator Kyl and I authored and that I helped push through during the closing days of the last Congress. 
Most important to me, the revised language should serve to expand the availability of Boys and Girls Clubs in rural areas. The original language was more restrictive, requiring the grants to be used only for the purpose of establishing Boys and Girls Clubs in public housing projects and other distressed areas. I have worked with the Boys and Girls and know that they understand that rural areas as well as urban can qualify as distressed areas. 
Nonetheless, the new language is more expansive and will give girls and boys in rural areas greater opportunities to share in Boys and Girls Clubs and their programs. The revised statute will authorize grants for establishing and extending facilities where needed. Particular emphasis continues to be given to housing projects, where Boys and Girls Clubs have proven effective in preventing youth crime, and to distressed areas, rural or urban. But the where needed language should help make expansion into rural areas a greater priority. 
Likewise, the removal of the language concerning contracts with HUD should streamline the expansion process and help make clear that such expansions are not limited to public housing projects. 
The changes made to that program by this bill also permit up to five percent of the grant funds to be used to establish a role model speakers' program. Anyone who has seen the Boys and Girls Clubs of America commercial with Denzel Washington and his coach will know the kinds of outstanding role models that we are seeking to promote to encourage and motivate young people to be involved, productive citizens. 
I have seen the outstanding results at the Boys and Girls Club in Burlington, VT, under the direction of Bob Robinson. The role models they provide include the outstanding instructors and volunteers who work in the club's many programs. I have also witnessed the outstanding results of the Kids `N Kops Program at the University of Vermont with the cooperation of local law enforcement. 
Expansions are proceeding and over 200 new clubs serving 180,000 youth were opened as a result of last year's legislation. I know that the Burlington Boys and Girls club received $100,000 to help enhance that Club's outreach efforts. I was glad to receive a letter from the Boys and Girls Clubs of America indicating that they are in the planning stages for the development of a new club in Rutland and researching the feasibility of a club in Essex Junction, as well. I would hope that with the continuation of this initiative they will look for opportunities to serve young people in St. Albans, Brattleboro, St. Johnsbury, Montpelier, and other Vermont locations, as well. I would be delighted for a sizeable portion of the 1 million additional young people who we hope will be served by the end of this century to come from the 145,000 young people in Vermont and those in other rural areas. 
In supporting this bill, I encourage the Boys and Girls Clubs as one example of a successful youth-oriented program that can help make a difference in young people's lives and prevent crime and delinquency. I also support the work of others who are effective with young people, including our outstanding 4-H programs. In working for the passage of this measure I have received assurances that other members will join with me in supporting these other fine programs, as well. 
It is nice to see Republican Members support juvenile crime prevention programs. Only a short time ago Republicans tried to stop passage of the President's 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and contended that crime prevention programs were `pork' or a waste of funds. 
In the juvenile crime bill I sponsored this year, S. 15, we include a number of initiatives to prevent juvenile crime and youth drug abuse. I hope that we can expect bipartisan support for those juvenile crime prevention provisions as we move forward in this Congress so that we can enact a comprehensive approach to the problem of youth crime. This measure should not become an excuse for anyone not to join with us to to bolster comprehensive drug education and prevention for all elementary and high school students. We should proceed to help create after school safe havens where children are protected from drugs, gangs, and crime with activities including drug prevention education, academic tutoring, mentoring, and abstinence training. This bill is a step but should not be the end of our efforts to support programs that help prevent juvenile delinquency, crime, and drug abuse.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past several months I have spoken about the crisis being created by the almost 100 vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country and the failure of the Senate to carry out its constitutional responsibilities to advise and consent to judicial confirmations. 
Today, the Washington Post, in an excellent article written by Sue Anne Pressley, focused on the consequences of this judicial crisis in one district court in Texas, the southern district of Texas. The article reports on the growing drug and immigration cases that are inundating this district court and the lack of Federal judges needed to administer justice in these cases. 
This district has two vacancies, one open since December 1, 1990, and the President has nominated Hilda Tagle to fill this judicial emergency vacancy. Ms. Tagle's nomination was first received by the Senate Judiciary Committee on August 10, 1995, but she has yet to have a hearing before the committee. 
This district in Texas is only one example of crisis that affects the entire country. We could find similar backlog problems in district courts in California, Florida, and other States that are swamped with rising cases and unfilled judicial vacancies. Yesterday, I met with members of the Federal Judges Association who are very concerned about the growing backlogs and rising caseloads in Federal courts across the Nation. 
I want to commend Senators Boxer, Sarbanes, and Kennedy for joining me yesterday on the Senate floor to speak out against the Senate's current stall on confirming Federal judges. I also want to commend Senator Kohl for his similar remarks today. 
Mr. President, confirming Federal judges should not be a partisan issue. The administration of justice is not a political issue. Working together, the Senate should do our constitutionally mandated job and proceed to confirm the judges we need for the Federal system.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution with Senator Abraham. I feel strongly that the Senate needs to speak out on the importance that our future telecommunications policy will play in the growth of commerce on the Internet. 
The Internet was born in 1974, but I missed the birth announcement. Like many who later would become avid Internet users, I let several years slip by before realizing the incredible potential of this new tool--that computers could virtually connect you to anyone, anywhere, anytime. 
The Internet is changing more than the speed of communications; it is changing the very dynamics of communication. Though still in its infancy, it already is beginning to change the way we do business. Over the past 2 years, sales generated through the Web grew more than 5,000 percent. And Net merchants are expected to sell billions of dollars worth of goods by the end of the century. This is a tremendous potential market for businesses. 
While Internet growth has been explosive, concrete standards for Internet commerce have not been set. Most online users still do not buy and sell goods over the Internet because they are afraid online hackers will steal their financial information. These are legitimate concerns that still have to be addressed by emerging security technologies. 
That is why I have worked with industry leaders during the past two years to find ways to promote more secure encryption technology. Better encryption means safer online commerce. We should be working with the private sector to help set standards that provide a secure Internet where people are safe paying their bills from their home computers. We should also encourage greater dialogue between Local Exchange Carriers and the Internet community. We do not want to choke Internet growth with excessive phone charges for Internet access. 
I use the Internet on a daily basis for anything from finding the latest Batman movie clips to online chats with Vermont schools. My work on Internet issues has earned me the nickname of `the Cyber Senator.' I have had many nicknames in my life. Some have been better than others but I am proud of this nickname because as the Cyber Senator, I can help Vermonters. That is why the Internet is so important to me. 
In two key ways, the opportunities opened by the Internet are a perfect match for Vermont. 
First, cyber-selling compliments our community-centered, environmentally-conscious style. In the past 25 years, Vermonters have shown uncommon stewardship in preserving our State's quality of life. Other States that only now are discovering these values will have trouble recapturing what already has eroded. Since the Internet allows anyone to work anywhere in the world, why not in Vermont where you can enjoy a unique lifestyle? 
Second, throughout this century, we Vermonters have been held back because we are not geographically near any major markets to sell our goods. Now, through the Internet, we can sell our goods in the blink of an eye to anyone in the world. 
Some pioneering Vermont businesses are already venturing into cyberspace. My home page on the World Wide Web is linked to Web sites of more than 100 Vermont businesses, ranging from the Quill Bookstore in Manchester Center to Jay Peak Ski Resort. For instance, The Flying Noodle in Waterbury Center now sells about 30 percent of its gourmet pasta and sauces over the Internet and has regular customers in Japan, Guam, Germany, France, and South Korea. 
We all have visions of what we want for Vermont as we enter the 21st century. My vision is that the Internet will unlock the potential for any Vermonter--and especially, our children--to stay in our beautiful state to earn a living. The Internet is a place where Vermonters can exchange ideas with people across the world with the stroke of a key or the click of a mouse. 
Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Michigan for submitting this resolution. It is strongly supported by the American Electronics Association, Business Software Alliance, and many other groups devoted to the growth of Internet commerce. I urge my colleagues to support our resolution.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken on the floor many times about the judicial vacancies in our Federal courts. It concerns me. In fact, I believe other than the subject of antipersonnel landmines, I have probably spoken on this subject more than any other. I am concerned that some in the Republican Party are engaging in a court-bashing situation that does not 
reflect the proud heritage of either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. 
I have spoken about the crisis that has been created by the almost 100 vacancies that are being perpetuated in the Federal courts around the country. We have recently seen a constitutional amendment proposed to remove the life tenure that has been the bedrock of judicial independence from the political branches since the ratification of our Constitution. It is just one of, I think, over 100 constitutional amendments proposed this year alone. It ignores the fact that our independent judiciary is the envy of the rest of the world. We have heard calls for impeachment when a judge rendered a decision with which a Republican House Member disagreed. I have read the Constitution. It speaks of very specific grounds for impeachment. Among those grounds is not that a Republican House Member disagrees with a judge. We would probably have a very difficult time if every judge could be impeached because any Member of the House or Senate disagreed with him. 
We have heard demands that the Congress act as a supercourt of appeals and legislatively review and approve or disapprove cases on a case-by-case basis. That is for the same Congress that has not yet even taken up a budget bill, even though the law requires us to do it by April 15. 
We are seeing exemplary nominees unnecessarily delayed for months, and vacancies persist into judicial emergencies. We are seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked, probed, and delayed to the point where one wonders why any man or woman would subject themselves to such a process or even allow themselves to be nominated for a Federal judgeship. 
Instead of reforming the confirmation process to make it more respectful of the privacy of the nominee, something that we all claim we want to do, the Republican majority in the Senate is moving decidedly in the other direction. They are approaching the imposition of political litmus tests, which some have openly advocated under the guise of opposing judicial activism, even though some of these same Members were the ones who said that nobody should impose a litmus test on judges. 
Even conservatives like Bruce Fein, in his recent opinion column in the New York Times, reject this effort. Actually, so do the American people. We have not had a time when any President or any Senate should be asked to impose litmus tests on an independent judiciary. 
I recommend my colleagues read the excellent commentary by Nat Hentoff on this new political correctness that appeared in the April 19, 1997, edition of the Washington Post. I have spoken in broad generalities, although each are backed up by dozens of cases. But let me be specific on one. The nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a Federal judge for the Central District of California is an example of the very shabby treatment accorded judicial nominees. The vacancy in this Federal court has existed for more than 15 months, and the people in central California--Republican, Democrat, Independent--are being denied a most needed, and in this case a most qualified, judge. 
Ms. Morrow's nomination is stuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee again. I am appalled by the treatment that Margaret Morrow has received before the Judiciary Committee. Ms. Morrow first came before the Judiciary Committee for a hearing and she was favorably and unanimously reported by the committee in June of 1996, almost exactly a year ago--a year ago less a couple of weeks. Then her nomination just got caught in last year's confirmation shutdown and she was not allowed to go through. So she has to start the process all over again this year. 
Let me tell you about Margaret Morrow. She is an exceptionally well qualified nominee. 
She was the first woman president of the California Bar Association, no small feat for anybody, man or woman. She is the past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is currently a partner at the well-known firm of Arnold & Porter, and she has practiced law for 23 years. She is supported by the Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who, incidentally, is Republican, and Robert Bonner the former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration under a Republican administration. Representative James Rogan from the House joined us during her second confirmation hearing and, of course, she is backed and endorsed by both Senators from California. 
Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice and to making lawyers more responsive and responsible as a profession. The Senate ought to be ashamed for holding up this outstanding nominee, and I question whether the Senate would give this kind of treatment to a man. It sure as heck has been doing it to a woman. 
Despite her qualifications, she is being made an example, I am not quite sure of what, but this woman who has dared to come forward to be a Federal judge is being made an example before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
At her second hearing before the committee on March 18, even though she already has gone through a committee hearing and even though the committee last year unanimously voted to confirm her with every single Republican and every single Democrat supporting her, even though she had gone through it once before, she was made to sit and wait until all the other nominees were questioned, as though she were being punished. `We have these men who want to be heard, and even though you had to do this before, you, woman nominee, sit in the back and the corner.' She was then subjected to round after round of repetitive questioning. 
Then came a series of written questions from several members, and they were all Republican members of the committee. Then came the `when did you start beating your husband' type questions to Ms. Morrow, based on her previous questions. I objected when Ms. Morrow was asked about her private views on all voter initiatives on the ballots in California for the last decade. Basically, she was being asked how did she vote in a secret ballot in the privacy of a voting booth on 160 initiatives on the ballot in California over the last 10 years. 
I defy any Member of the Senate, if they were given a list of 160 items in their local elections, State elections, that have been on the ballot over the last 10 years, to be able to honestly say how they voted on every single one of those. But even before they got to the question of could they say how they voted, I would stand up and say, `What has the Senate stooped to when we ask people how they voted in a secret ballot?" 
Mr. President, we fought--successfully fought--a Revolutionary War, among other reasons, to maintain the sanctity of the ballot box. We fought a Civil War, among other reasons, to maintain the sanctity of the ballot box. We stood up to fascism, Nazism, World Wars because we were protecting our democracy and way of life. Some of the most remarkable and respected Republicans and Democrats of this country's history, and some of the most responsible and respected Republicans and Democrats in my lifetime, and some of the most responsible and respected Republicans and Democrats of my 22 years in the Senate have stood and fought to maintain the privacy of the ballot box. I, Mr. President, am not going to be a Senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee that allows that sanctity to be destroyed. 
When I challenged the question, it was revised so as to demand only her private views on 10 voter initiatives on issues ranging from carjacking to drive-by shootings to medical use of marijuana and the retention election of Rose Bird as chief justice of the California Supreme Court. 
Ms. Morrow previously stated she did not take public positions on these voter initiatives, so asking for her private views necessarily asked how she voted on them. We are, thus, quizzing nominees on how they voted in their home State ballot initiatives. Why we need this information, even if we were allowed to follow someone into the ballot box and see how they voted--something none of us would allow anybody to do to us--even if we are allowed, to say while we would not do it to any of us, we would do it to this woman. 
Why do we need this information to determine if she is qualified? In fact, she explained to the committee that she is not anti-initiative, and in response to written questions, she discussed an article she wrote in 1988 and explained:  
My goal was not to eliminate the need for initiatives. Rather, I was proposing ways to strengthen the initiative process by making it more efficient and less costly, so it could better serve the purpose for which it was originally intended. At the same time, I was suggesting measures to increase the Legislature's willingness to address issues of concern to ordinary citizens regardless of the views of special interests or campaign contributors. I don't believe these goals are inconsistent. 
The initiative process was a reform championed by California Governor Hiram Johnson in 1911 to ensure that the electorate had a means of circumventing the Legislature when it could or would not pass legislation desired by the people because of the influence of special interests. As envisioned by Governor Johnson and others, the initiative was designed to complement the legislative process, not to substitute for it. This is my understanding of the role of the initiative process, and this is what I had in mind when I wrote the 1988 article. The reasons that led Governor Johnson to create the initiative process in 1911 are still valid today, and it remains an important aspect of our democratic form of Government. 
I ask, Mr. President, does that response sound like somebody who is antidemocratic? Yet, she has been forced to answer questions about how she views the initiative process in written questions and, again, in revised follow-up written questions over the period of the last month. 
Again, I remind everybody, this is a woman who was voted out unanimously last year by the committee. No objective evaluation of the record can yield the conclusion that she is anti-initiative. No fair reading of her 1988 article even suggests that. I might add, parenthetically, and what should be the only really important question, there is nothing in her record that suggests she would not follow the precedents of the court of appeals for her district or the U.S. Supreme Court. There is nothing to suggest that she does not believe in stare decisis or that she would not follow it. 
Recently, I received a letter from a distinguished California attorney, and a lifelong Republican, who wrote to protest the unfair treatment being accorded Margaret Morrow. He wrote that he was `ashamed of [his] party affiliation when [he sees] the people's elected representatives who are Republicans engaging in or condoning the kind of childish, punitive conduct to which Ms. Morrow is being subjected.' He asks us to stop permitting the harassment of this nominee. I join with this distinguished Republican, and I ask the same thing: Stop harassing this nominee. I don't care if the harassment is because she is a woman, I don't care if the harassment is based on some philosophical difference, the fact of the matter is, she is one of the most qualified people I have seen before the committee in 22 years, Republican or Democrat, and she ought to be voted on and confirmed with pride--with pride--by the U.S. Senate. 
We have heard nothing but praise for Ms. Morrow from those who know her and those who worked with her and litigated against her. In fact, the legal community in and around Los Angeles is, frankly, shocked that Margaret Morrow is being put through this ordeal and has yet to be confirmed. The Los Angeles Times has already published one editorial against the manner in which the Senate is proceeding with the Morrow nomination. I ask, to what undefined standard is she being held? What is this new standard --it is kind of hidden--which has never shown up before? It has not shown up for any male nominee that I know of.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, that is from the Women's Lawyer Association of Los Angeles. 
Last week, at a Judiciary Committee executive business session, I asked her name be added to the agenda and that the committee report her nomination to the Senate for confirmation. All questions have been answered. The Republican Senator who propounded the questions on initiatives said he would not filibuster her nomination and agreed not to hold her up any longer. I thank him publicly and appreciate his forthrightness. 
But even though we looked around that room and said, `Does anybody have any objection to her,' and I had gotten absolute confirmation from every single Democratic Senator that they were ready to vote positively for her and would vote for her on the floor immediately, her nomination was not called up. My requests that she be called up for a vote before the committee was rejected, and she remains in limbo almost 2 months after her second confirmation hearing and one full year after she was first nominated. 
There is now what amounts to a secret hold on this nomination in the Judiciary Committee. Some Senator is holding her up. Some Senator doesn't have the courage to come on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say why this woman is objectionable to him. Some Senator will hold her up secretly because he doesn't want to vote on her publicly, even though I guarantee you, if we had a rollcall vote on her, it would be overwhelmingly positive. We should proceed with the nomination of Margaret Morrow without further delay.

Mr. LEAHY. Let us bring the nomination up. 
The irony is, you know and I know, with her qualifications, anybody would be embarrassed to vote against her because there would be no way they could explain back home how a woman, one of the most qualified nominees to come before the Senate for a Federal court nominated by any President, Republican or Democrat, is held up. 
I say to my friend from California, who has worked so hard and so diligently, one-on-one with Members to get this moving, it is, unfortunately, part of a picture. I have this chart which shows now we have 99 vacancies. We will have more. The number of judges who have been confirmed in the 105th Congress--when we first put this chart together, we wanted to show the vacancies on this side. 
I see my friend from Maryland, too. I will show him, too. 
We wanted to show the vacancies confirmed on the other side. We could not see the number that have been confirmed, so we put in this magnifying glass. I feel like Sherlock Holmes with my little magnifying glass going down. 
There are 99 vacancies, and down here, two being confirmed. We have had more vacancies this year than we have had judicial confirmations in the U.S. Senate. Maybe we can shave a day off each one of these recesses and confirm some judges during that time. We have not had time to do much else. We ought to at least confirm those. 
In fact--and I will share one of these with my friend from Maryland. The distinguished senior Senator from Maryland is on the floor. I thought he might be interested in noting where we stand on this. 
You might want to take a look at that, I say to my good friend from Maryland. We came at the beginning of the year with actually 78 vacancies. And then, as often happens, people realize that they have grown older or they're taking senior status, whatever, they start retiring. We go from 78 to 89, to 92, to 94, to 96, to 99. 
We go in January, zero confirmed; in February, zero confirmed; in March, two confirmed; and those are the same two listed here. We have not gone above two. So while this list goes up, that stays even. People are used to talking about zero population growth. This is zero population growth in the judiciary. 
I understand that Speaker Gingrich and others felt there was some political gain to shutting down the Federal Government about a year and a half ago. The American people did not think there was, but for some reason they did. It appears to me what they are trying to do is shut down the Federal courts. This is an unprecedented, unprecedented situation. 
In the 102d Congress we had a Republican President and a Democratic-controlled Senate. We confirmed 124 judges. 
In the 103d Congress we confirmed 129. 
Even in the last Congress 75. 
Now we confirmed 2 with 99 vacancies. 
Chief Justice Rehnquist says: 
The number of judicial vacancies can have a profound impact on a court's ability to manage its caseload effectively. 
He says: 
It's hoped that the administration and Congress will continue to recognize that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice. 
That is what it comes to. 
The American taxpayers, Republicans and Democrats alike, pay taxes to have their courts run. The courts do not run if the vacancies are there. You do not have criminal cases handled the way they should. People are forced to plea bargain because they cannot get through. You do not have civil cases that you may want 
to hear if you are a litigant; you have a case you want heard, you cannot have it heard. This is wrong. 
I was in another State the other day, Monday, and somebody was telling me how they have to go out and hire private judges to hear their cases. Now, these are people who are already paying the taxes. They are already paying for courts that are sitting there. But there are no judges to hear the cases. The vacancies cannot be filled so they go out and hire private judges. 
I mean, this is sort of like saying I will pay my taxes to have a police officer and a police department, and I paid for it. The money is there. We pay the money for the police department and the police officers, but some person in the community says, `Well, we're not going to hire any police officers. We're not going to have anybody there. So even though you paid your taxes for that, if you want your property protected, you have got to go out and hire a private police officer.' Well, we are doing the same thing with the judges. 
Mr. President, I think this is an outrageous situation. Let us see what we have here. 
In 1980, we did nine appeals courts--these were Presidential election years during the second Senate session, Presidential election years, and we did 9 appeals court judges and 55 district court judges. All the way down through here you can see many times with Republican Presidents and a Democratic Congress we cooperated. 
Nothing has happened here.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that over the past 2 weeks I have twice corrected a misstatement with respect to the three nominations pending on the Senate executive calendar. Twice, Republicans have said that some unknown Democrat had a hold on these judicial nominations. This is not so. Every single Democrat in the Senate is ready to vote, and vote today, on all the judicial nominees, the three judicial nominees is all it is, that have been voted out of committee so far. Every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is prepared to vote at the next Judiciary Committee meeting on all the nominees that are pending there. There is no, no Democrat with a hold on any judicial nominee--I want that very, very clear--neither in the committee nor in the Senate. If we have to have rollcall votes, we are glad to do that. But we should have these people come up. 
We received Jeffrey Miller's nomination in July 1996, last Congress. The President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy, a vacancy that has existed since December 1994. We are in 1997 now. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies we should have filled. He has the support of both Senators. He finally had a confirmation hearing 2 1/2 years, almost, after the vacancy occurred. His nomination was considered. It has been reported to the Senate. We should vote on it. 
We first received Donald Middlebrooks' nomination in September of 1996, last year. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress. This is for a vacancy that has been there since 1992, 5 years ago. That is a judicial emergency vacancy, and he has the support of both Senators from his State, one a Democrat, senior Senator, Senator Graham, one a Republican, Senator Mack. This was reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate April 17. 
Now, here is a vacancy that has existed for 5 years. We have a judge who has gone through the Senate Judiciary Committee, reported to the Senate, supported by the two Senators from his State, one a Democrat, one a Republican. For God's sake, if we cannot vote on it, what in Heaven's name can we vote on? This should be about as noncontroversial as voting to commend the Fourth of July. 
We first received Robert Pratt's nomination in August of 1996. We did not get a hearing last Congress. The President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy in the district court for the southern district of Iowa. He had a confirmation hearing on March 18. He was supported by the two Senators from Iowa, Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley, and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee on April 17. 
Well, why can we not go forward with him? You look at what we have, a distinguished woman who is being shunted aside by somebody who does not have the guts to come forth on the Senate floor and say why that Senator is holding her up. We have distinguished other judges that have gone through the confirmation process, supported by the two Senators, a Republican and a Democrat from their State, they cannot come forward. 
I take our advise-and-consent function very seriously, especially when it comes to confirmation of Federal judges who have a lifetime appointment. Our system of government with coordinate branches and separation of powers, that is our responsibility. I voted to confirm some judges who ended up 
rendering decisions which I strongly disagreed. I voted for some judges to move from one Federal court to another, even though they had also had decisions with which I disagreed. I voted against some who turned out to be better than I predicted. But we voted on them. 
If a judge decides a case incorrectly, well, then you have appeal. I remember when I used to prosecute cases, I remember somebody saying, as the juror went out to defense counsel, `Well, let justice be done,' and they said, `Well, if that happens, we will appeal.' If you lose a case, appeal it. If you think you have bad law, have a legislative change. In fact, the reason the founders included the protection of lifetime appointments for Federal judges was to insulate them from politics and political influence. 
Merrick Garland had an 18-month wait for confirmation--a judge virtually everybody in the country that ruled on this, from the right to the left, on the judicial selection, said he was one of the most qualified persons ever to be up for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. President, 23 Members of this body, all on the other side of the aisle, voted against Merrick Garland for that judgeship. Not one of them spoke against the nominee. Not one of them spoke against his impeccable credentials. In fact, some who voted against him praised his qualifications. They say they voted against filling an unneeded seat on the court of appeals, in the face of a letter from Chief Judge Silberman, who said they did need the seat, and a statement from Senator Hatch, who said it was needed. 
In his concluding remarks, Senator Hatch said, `Playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it.' I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Let the Senate quit playing partisan politics with judicial nominations. Let us do our constitutionally mandated job and proceed to confirm the judges we need for the Federal system.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are some individuals whose personal courage is almost impossible to fathom, who will be long remembered for the example they set in standing up for what they believed for the sake of all of us. Wei Jingsheng, who is perhaps China's most famous political prisoner, is one such individual. Today I join Senators Moynihan, Helms, Wellstone and Kennedy in recognizing today's publication of Mr. Wei's collection of letters to Chinese leaders and members of his family, and essays about democracy, `The Courage to Stand Alone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings.' 
Known as the intellectual leader of the Democracy Wall movement, China's first prodemocracy protest, Mr. Wei has spent nearly all of the last 18 years in prison for his outspoken, unrelenting criticism of China's political leaders and his thoughtful and inspiring writings about the need for democratic change and the rule of law in China. In one essay, Mr. Wei describes the law in China as, `merely a `legal weapon' that anyone in power can wield against his enemies.' 
In an effort to convince the International Olympic Committee to award China the 2000 Olympic Games, the Chinese Government released Mr. Wei in late 1993. The cynicism of that decision was exposed just 6 months later, when he was rearrested and held incommunicado for 20 months, in part for meeting with Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck. He is currently serving a 14-year sentence. 
In addition to the egregious violations of the rights to freedom of expression, due process, and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, I am very concerned about Mr. Wei's health. He is suffering from high blood pressure and a heart condition, and has not received the medical attention he needs. He is not permitted to go outside, nor is he allowed physical exercise. I am told that prison authorities have moved other prisoners into Mr. Wei's cell to monitor and limit his political writing. If Mr. Wei serves all of his current 14-year prison sentence, he will be 60 years old when he is released. His health is so fragile it is uncertain whether he will ever get out alive. 
Mr. President, Mr. Wei is one of thousands of courageous people who have been thrown in prison, tortured or otherwise silenced in order to squelch any expression for democratic change in China. Despite repeated attempts by our administration to discuss human rights with Chinese authorities, the Chinese Government has continued to insist that internationally recognized human rights are an internal matter. The situation has gotten worse, not better. 
I urge all Senators read `The Courage to Stand Alone,' and to remember Wei Jingsheng and the thousands of other Chinese citizens who have remained steadfast in support of democracy and human rights, in the face of repression.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in Vermont, you have to wait until May to see signs of life, signs of spring. But this May has been unseasonably cold, and got a little colder earlier this week when Vermont lost Jack Barry--one of the true, enduring treasures of the most special State in the Union. 
Jack Barry left us on Sunday, May 4, at the age of 70, after a long struggle with cancer. He was in his third year as a senator, he was my first press secretary when I came to Washington as a 34-year-old Senator. But most of all he was an extraordinary and beloved broadcaster on radio and television whose ubiquitous presence on the Vermont airwaves has made thousands of Vermonters feel as though Jack Barry has been a member of the family. 
In fact, he really was a member of thousands of Vermont families, and more welcome in their homes than just about anybody else. 
Jack achieved legendary status among Vermont broadcasters. As an interviewer, he had an unparalleled ability to get to the essence of a person and an issue. 
Jack's life in radio and television makes any review of his achievements read like a broadcasting directory. As you might expect, Jack had an on-air personality and voice to die for, and he was the same off the air, as fresh and genuine as the Green Mountains that he loved. 
He hosted call-in shows where civility and common sense were the standard, he moderated and produced several public affairs programs where he was the most prepared person there. And he was a popular master of ceremonies for a wide range of nonprofit and public interest causes. He was Vermont's Sportscaster of the Year in 1972 and the Vermont Association of Broadcasters gave him the Distinguished Broadcasting Award in 1981 and, to make sure that everyone knew, they installed him into their Hall of Fame in 1995. He was the Rutland Herald's Vermonter of the Year in 1991. He lent his considerable talents to many community organizations including St. Michael's College--his alma mater, and mine--the Vermont Special Olympics, United Way, and the Vermont Cancer Society. He was past chairman of the Vermont Heart Association and was serving on the national board of the American Heart Association. For the last 3 years he served in the Vermont Senate, where, as Senate President pro tempore Peter Shumlin puts it, Jack `was like a kid in a candy shop.' 
He loved people. He truly loved people--all people--just as he truly loved politics. And he did not shrink from controversy to act on his convictions. He embraced controversy, if need be, because he never gave up his convictions, as when he forcefully argued against the popular rush to criminalize the rare instances of flag burning. And our State agreed with him. 
I want to put into the Record at the end of my remarks a selection of the many news accounts, columns, and editorials this week that recite so many more of his achievements. But first I want to recount some of the personal recollections about Jack from his friends and colleagues that have come my way since Sunday. 
George Goldring, who works at WVMT, recalls the days when he and Jack broadcasted University of Vermont football--Jack, for WVMT, and George, for WJOY. 
He fondly remembers one night after a game in Pennsylvania, when they were sitting around a hotel room with a couple of other Vermont broadcasters. Nobody went to bed. The night dissolved into morning as Jack regaled them with story after story and joke after joke, keeping everyone in stitches all night long. 
Mr. President, having been one of those fortunate enough to have sat in on one of these evenings--you do not want the night to end. It is the best of Irish storytelling. 
George says that Jack was a professional's professional in front of a microphone. He was never at a loss for words. 
John Goodrow of my staff and Jack both worked at WJOY in Burlington in different eras. Last November, the station threw a party to mark its 50th anniversary, and through the evening all the former on-air personalities were introduced. But when Jack Barry was introduced, the applause was the loudest and the longest, the most fervent, the most heartfelt. 
John's father, Goody Goodrow, recalls getting to know Jack while Goody was a student at St. Michael's College after serving in the Navy in the Second World War. He was one of the many St. Mike's students who would phone in music requests to Jack's radio show. Goody himself was a musician who once played piano in Artie Shaw's military band, and he made a living in the Burlington area as a musician--in fact, as a young student, I danced some of those times he played--including stints, after those years at St. Mike's, playing the piano on Jack's radio shows on WJOY. 
Joel Najman engineered Jack's show at WJOY for years, and he now works at WDEV. He tells about Jack's natural curiosity about the world. He was a sponge for information and ideas. Joel said he had time to read just one newspaper before Jack's morning show, but before airtime, Jack already had read four or five newspapers, and from personal experience I know he committed them virtually to memory. 
Ken Horseman was an executive producer at Vermont ETV--public television in Vermont--and also produced Jack's radio show for a time. And Ken's fondest memories of Jack center on the old Vermont ETV auction which Ken produced and Jack hosted. Jack would hold forth through 10 hours of live television, and he would do this for 10 straight days. He would prime the pump for the station's coffers, and people all over the State and in nearby Canada and everywhere else would tune in to see Jack Barry. 
Jerry Lewis has nothing on Jack Barry as a telethon maestro. More than 3,000 Vermonters volunteered during the auction over those 10 days. To them and to the viewing audience, Jack was the auction's symbol. I was fortunate enough to have had a chance to be on some of those auctions as a volunteer, as was, I think, the whole Vermont congressional delegation at one time or another, because Jack would just grab everybody. You could be the person who runs the gas station; you could be the Governor of the State. Jack Barry would say: `Now here is the time you are going to auction,' and you would. 
He thrived on the unpredictability of live television. He was steady in the midst of chaos, as Ken remembers. 
Mike Donoghue of the Burlington Free Press grew up in Vermont listening to Jack on the radio. Like all of us, he remembers his signature line at the end of every radio spot: `Don't forget to tell 'em Barry brought ya.' Of course, that is exactly what people did. 
Jack brought us the warmth of his smile. He nourished our sense of community and purpose in Vermont. And he brought us the gift of his friendship. 
Last September, Marcelle and I attended Jack's surprise 70th birthday party at his son-in-law's camp in Jonesville, VT. 
Mr. President, if there is any way that I would remember Jack, it was at this party. It was vintage. He was surrounded by the family he adored and who adored him even more. Politicians and political junkies were everywhere, from both parties, and, of course, Jack was at center stage holding forth and carrying the day. I took photograph after photograph, although in one way I did 
not need to because the memories are as clear as the photographs are. Everybody came in, and it would be like they were the one person there with Jack. He would hug them and they would hug him. And the children were around. It was chaotic and it was fun. It was very, very, very Irish. It is that sunny day in Jonesville that sticks most in my mind when I think of Jack. 
But I also think of Monday of this week when Marcelle and I went to Jack's home and visited with his wife, Bunny, a dear friend, the woman he loved so much, and with other family members, and the stories about Jack's humor and generosity and humanity rose easily and quickly to the surface as they always have when talking about Jack. One minute Marcelle and I were crying; the next minute we were laughing with everybody else there. Kathy, Maureen, and Bridget were there, Bunny's daughter Brigid and others, Tim and Wright, and we talked with Bridget and Kathy and Maureen about the time when Jack Barry was first down here as press secretary, and Marcelle was taking the kids on a ride in the car coming back from somewhere and two cars stopped in front of us--and I mean this is 20 years ago, Mr. President. Some of the people were getting out of the two cars in front of Marcelle, and they were getting into a fight and Marcelle was telling the children, `Get down! Get down!' And they were saying, `We want to see! We want to see!' And it was typical of what any one of Jack's kids would want: `But I want to see what's going on!' 
I think of all the times I would call him for advice, in good times and in some very sad times. Jack was always there. We might not have talked to each other for weeks and we would pick up the conversation as though it ended minutes before. I remember calling him and asking him for a joke because I was going to be speaking somewhere, and to start off he would say, `Well, there were these two Irish guys,' and we would both be laughing, and I hadn't even heard the joke. We would start laughing right away because we knew how funny it would be. 
I recall a Christmas when Marcelle was on duty at the hospital and I was calling friends, and I called up Jack, after he had taken up his new duties in the Vermont Statehouse, and I said, `Hi, Senator.' He said, `Hi, Senator.' And we were going on calling each other Senator for a couple minutes until we were both laughing so hard we sort of lost it. 
We go back a long time, Mr. President. His father and mother and my father and mother were friends. Jack and I knew each other forever it seems. I think of the days when he was down here, when we first moved down a few days before the swearing-in. It was New Year's Eve. We had rented a townhouse. And the moving van came that day. We were unloading boxes, and Jack shows up, and a couple other Vermonters were here with me, and we decided we would have a New Year's Eve party. We invited the two moving van people. We sat around on crates and boxes and opened them up trying to find a plate, a glass or silverware, ordering in pizza and soda and beer and what not. Jack put us all at ease. He started telling stories. Midnight came and midnight went, and that party went on and on. 
How much I wish it could still go on today. I think of people that Jack helped during his years here in Washington, people who were cursed with the affliction that some have of drinking, and Jack would work with AA. He would be the person they would call when they really needed help and he would go. And after that time I heard from so many Members of Congress and others who would come to me and tell me, `Jack Barry really saved my life.' 
I remember him interviewing Cabinet Members down here for Vermont ETV and them telling me afterward that he was the most prepared interviewer they ever had. 
So I have lost a dear, dear friend. Marcelle and I have spent a lot of time talking this week about how much he meant to us. We also know that Vermont has lost one of its real treasures. So Marcelle and I join all Vermonters in extending wishes of comfort and appreciation to Bunny and to all the family. I will put, as I said, items in the Record, but one especially from Bridget Barry Caswell--his daughter who we know and love and are so proud of, a great journalist in her own right and one who learned so much from her father--the eulogy she gave this week in his memory at St. Michael's College. 
I will say this to the family, as my Great-Aunt Kate, who came here from Ireland, would say of a good Irish person when they would leave this vale of tears: `He went straight up.' Jack Barry went straight up, and I cannot help but think of the Irish jokes that are going through the heavens tonight.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, and I will be very brief, as I advised the senior Senator from Alaska also. 
I hope Senators will support the Senator from West Virginia on this issue. I have been here for 22 years. Twenty of those years I have served on the Appropriations Committee and proudly so. I know how hard we work to get our 13 appropriations bills through. Sometimes we have not. We have gotten most of them, and the rest have had to be done by a continuing resolution; but usually for just a few weeks, while we finish them up. 
If this went through, this automatic continuing resolution, I do not care if it is at 125 percent of funding or at 30 percent of funding, it is poor policy. Basically it says to the Appropriations Committee--actually it says to the House and Senate--go home. We do not need you. We are on automatic pilot. 
That is not what we are elected to do. We are elected to make the tough choices, vote for or against them, and do it on time. 
So I support, and gladly and proudly support, the Senator from West Virginia on this. Whether we have a Republican President or Democratic President, Republican or Democratic Senate, I would vote exactly the same way. I do not want automatic continuing resolutions because we will not, then, have our feet put to the fire and have to actually cast the tough votes and make the policy decisions the people of America expect us to do.

Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Connecticut is exactly right. There are many commercial technologies that can save the Defense Department money in the long run. For example, one Navy COSSI program uses sensors and software to monitor engine and rotor components on helicopters. The technology tells the user when a given part needs to be replaced, as opposed to the current system, which for safety reasons requires perfectly usable parts to be replaced at regular intervals. Navy program managers have estimated that this technology can save over $1 billion over 10 years if adopted on just two kinds of helicopters. In this time of tight budgets, this is the kind of program that we should all be supporting.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this year, the Sunday Rutland Herald and Sunday Times Argus had an article about a fellow Montpelier neighbor, Dr. Ernest Tomasi. Dr. Tomasi was named the distinguished citizen of the year by the Montpelier Rotary Club. 
Madam President, I have known Dr. Tomasi my whole life. And my parents knew him even before I did. He is a remarkable man, and probably one of the last examples of a country doctor, even though he has always practiced in our capital city. 
Dr. Tomasi, a man very proud of his Italian heritage, as was my late mother, was one who would make sure that everybody who needed a physician received that physician's care. 
So many times people would come to him telling him that they could not afford a doctor's care but needed a doctor's care. They always got it. It would be remarkable if somebody were able to tally up all the people of central Vermont who were cared for by him but never received a bill because they could not pay for it. 
I also think of the number of times as a youngster seeing him going out making house calls, and then even in later years, even after I became a U.S. Senator, seeing Dr. Tomasi with his battered bag heading off for house calls. 
It was my privilege to see him in 1994, when he went back for the 50th anniversary of D-Day. He had landed on Normandy as a young medic and, as he said, was one of the only ones who went ashore without guns. He also tells some pretty horrific stories of what happened to the people who were landing. It was a mark of his bravery that even though he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and a Presidential Citation, this was never a part of his conversation, and only reluctantly did he go back for the 50th anniversary. 
My wife and I had a chance to talk with him on different occasions while he was there. He was one of the brave, brave people President Clinton and General Shalikashvili and others referred to at that celebration.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Walter `Peanut' Kennedy, the late Speaker of the House of Representatives came from the district of Chelsea, VT. They used a version of Vermont's old mountain rule. In a local form, mountain rule came from the town's unwritten agreement that State representatives alternate between the sides of the mountain that divided the town at every biennial election. It was about as good a reason for term limits as many I have heard argued on this floor in recent years. 
It followed the real mountain rule in Vermont which alternated Governors from one side of the Green Mountains to the other side. Madam President, the Governor would come from the eastern side of the mountains in one election cycle and then from the western side in the next. Of course, they were all Republicans so it worked out very well throughout those years. 
Since the town was overwhelmingly Republican and the candidate from either side of the mountain could not hope to succeed under any other party preference--the tradition more or less held until reapportionment of the legislature along the one man-one vote decision of the U.S. Supreme Court changed the nature of Vermont's system forever. 
I preface my remarks today with this brief history so that you can appreciate the background from which this rough hewn, shrewd, humorous, and eminently fair gentleman rose to become a legislator, Speaker of the House, and his party's candidate for Governor in 1974. 
With Peanut Kennedy's passing, we close the book on a period in Vermont when character, common sense, and honesty were alone sufficient to insure personal triumph and political success. 
Peanut sold used cars--and they weren't all good cars. He would tell his customers--especially enthusiastic young farm boys who were making their first major purchase with hard earned money--to look beyond the flashy chrome and white wall tires. If necessary, he would further curb their enthusiasm by suggesting the vehicle had an estimated lifespan of the distance to the grocery store a half mile down the road. 
Those were cars he kept on the lot only to have the pleasure of selling them to folks like you and me who could afford a lesson in the perils of used car negotiations. 
`You don't want this car,' he would finally tell a local customer and move him toward another part of the lot. 
Peanut, rising to the chairmanship of the House Highway Committee, then Speaker and finally rewarded as his party's gubernatorial candidate, was rarely addressed as Walter. He retained his earthy sense of humor and Yankee mannerisms, offensive to the few--loved by the many. He was an antecedent of political correctness--fixed in his ways, colorful in his language, and prone to startle constituents, legislators, Governors and lobbyists with the frankness of his responses. 
He hated ad hoc committees which he said were merely ways for political leaders to transfer decision malting responsibility to another body. 
`Ad hoc,' he once challenged a leader of his own party on the House floor, `Sounds like someone clearing his throat.' 
He once publicly described a Governor, who was concerned over a prolonged and politically debilitating debate over enacting his proposal for a sales tax as `nervous as a whore in church,' over the prospects of passing his legislation. Kennedy never doubted the tax would be enacted, once the talking was over and the nervous legislators regained their courage to an unpopular, but necessary broad based tax to finance State government programs. 
He was never a man to go off the record, he was never a man to go against his word. 
When he ran for Governor in 1974 he traveled through southern Vermont extensively for the first time in years and became aware of the change taking place as a result of a revolution in transportation systems--many of which he had helped put in motion himself from Montpelier. 
I think it was the first time he realized that Vermont was changing so dramatically from the community or farms and small, self-governing communities that settled problems at town meetings and pot luck suppers. 
`It's not Vermont anymore,' he told friends. The visit seemed to inhibit his candidacy and he failed to give Vermont a spirited campaign against a popular incumbent. 
I traveled with Peanut Kennedy when he ran for Governor in 1974, and is probably an indication of the bipartisan nature of the man. Even though he was running for Governor on the Republican ticket, I for the Senate on the Democratic ticket, we would have occasions just because we wanted to be in each other's company that we would ride together from one function to another. 
He had his big old black Imperial. I would hop in the car with him. Somebody would drive my car along behind. And I would be laughing so hard by the time I would get to the next place, I could barely remember my own lines as he would tell one story after another. 
At home, with his wife Sylvia, he was a very private man and devoted husband. Vermonters shared his grief over the tragic death of his son in a fire. After the election in 1973, Kennedy returned to his business and quietly retired from the political arena which had taken him so far. But the State had changed and Peanut's beliefs and principles were too deeply ingrained. 
Out State has lost a great public servant, and to those of us fortunate enough to have known him a great friend as well. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. In that regard, today being Law Day I think we should honor the Federal judiciary. We have a political climate where many of my colleagues bash the Federal judiciary on a daily basis and propose legislation that threatens a time-honored independence of the Federal judiciary. I think our Nation's judges deserve our respect, admiration, and support--not our disdain, scorn, and antipathy. Anywhere you go in the world you will find that one of the things that stands out, one of the things admired most about the United States, is the independence of our Federal judiciary. 
For the past 200 years, they protected the freedoms and fundamental rights we all take for granted. You could ask, where would our cherished rights like first amendment-protected free speech and the right of religious freedom be without the Federal courts? It is ironic that the right of free speech that the Federal judiciary bashers take for granted in the war against judges has been protected time and time again by those very same judges. 
It is our independent judiciary that handed down landmark decisions like Brown versus Board of Education. Without our independent judiciary, how long would African-American children have to suffer deplorable conditions in substandard schools? I remember after Brown versus Board of Education, we had the bumper stickers and billboards, `Impeach Earl Warren,' and `Impeach the Supreme Court.' Well, only because they were politically independent could they hand down a decision so unpopular at the time, but so recognized today universally as the right decision. I shudder to think where we would be today with Federal judges who are tied to the political whims of the moment. We should talk about where the country would be without independent Federal judges. 
The nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United States has proposed changes in the makeup of our courts. It has been 7 years since Congress last seriously reexamined the caseload of the Federal judiciary. 
Mr. President, our judges do an admirable job under tough conditions. They endure constant criticism and heavy caseloads. Contrary to what some of my Republican colleagues have stated, there is a need for more Federal judges. 
The Judicial Conference of the United States, the nonpartisan policymaking arm of the judicial branch, believes that the continuing heavy caseload of our courts of appeals and district courts merit additional judges. Overworked judges and heavy caseloads slow down the judicial process, and as we all know, justice delayed is justice denied. Mr. President, we must act now. 
Mr. President, on Law Day, a day to commemorate our Nation's legal system and the freedoms it is designed to protect, I introduce the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997. This legislation, identical to the recommendations of the nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United States, would create 12 additional permanent judgeships and five temporary judgeships for the U.S. Court of Appeals; and 24 additional permanent judgeships and 12 temporary judgeships for the U.S. district courts. 
In 1984, Congress passed a bill to address the need for additional judgeships. Six years later, in 1990, Congress again fulfilled its constitutional responsibility and enacted the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 because of a sharply increasing caseload, particularly for drug-related crimes. 
It is now 7 years since Congress last seriously reexamined the caseload of the Federal judiciary and the need for more Federal judges. Let us act now. Let us fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Let us ensure that justice is not delayed or denied for anyone.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as some of my colleagues know, I was considering introducing, as a substitute to the bill by the distinguished Senator from Georgia and others, the bill of the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Porter, as introduced in the other body. I am withholding that because staff from my office and staff of the distinguished Senator from Georgia and others have 
been talking about some additional amendments to the pending legislation that, if acceptable to all sides, would improve a number of the concerns that the Senator from Vermont has with the pending legislation, concerns I will not go into again here because the Senator from Vermont has discussed them on a number of occasions on the floor. 
While I was waiting to make that announcement, though, I could not but hear some comments of the Senator from Texas regarding the budget. 
Frankly, I will say to my friend from Texas or anybody else, if they are not happy with the recommendations being made by the White House or Democratic Senators or anything else, the Republican Party has a majority of the Members in the House of Representatives, the Republican Party has a majority of the Members in the Senate of the United States. All they have to do, if they have a budget they prefer to anything the President has, is bring it forward and pass it. They have enough votes to pass it. And the President cannot even veto it; it is a budget resolution. So it is a little bit disingenuous to suggest that somehow the President or anybody else is winning on this. 
The Republican Party has the majority of votes in the House and the Senate. A budget resolution cannot be vetoed. All they have to do is pass it. In fact, the law requires that they pass it by April 15--I mean, April 15 of this year, not next year. The law also requires that you and I, Mr. President, file our income taxes by April 15. If we do not, we get a knock on the door from the IRS. Apparently nobody is going to knock on the door when the Congress did not pass a budget resolution by April 15. 
But I suggest, before anybody goes tearing too hard after the President or anybody else that may have been negotiating a budget, with all due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if they do not like it, just pass their own. They could have followed the law and passed one by April 15. They did not. I will not chastise them for not obeying the law, even though they want the rest of us to. But just pass it, if you like. You can do it. I will also say, as far as passing an automatic continuing resolution, whoa Nellie, that has nothing to do with cutting budgets. I am perfectly happy to vote for budget cuts. I voted for more successful budget cuts than an awful lot of people in this body, I mean those that actually passed in the Appropriations Committee and elsewhere. 
But this idea of some kind of an automatic continuing resolution is just a law that says we do not have to do our work. Now, by the end of September we have to pass 13 appropriations bills. If we all just go off and take another vacation, do not pass them, then this law proposed by the Senator from Texas and others would kick in, and nobody would even know if we were out of town. 
I prefer we do our work. Maybe some of the same people, some of the same people who were unable to come up with a budget by April 15, who refused to follow the law to come up with a budget by April 15, want this new wrinkle, this unprecedented wrinkle of basically passing appropriations bills in advance, because if you pass this law, this continuing resolution, we can just go home. Maybe the American people would like that, but I do not think we are meeting our responsibilities. So I think we should stop the gimmicks in the appropriations bills. And this is just one more. It is not an issue of whether you want to cut budgets or not. It is an issue of whether we do our work. 
We have had several vacations this year and we confirmed two Federal judges and we are now in the fifth month. There are 100 vacancies. We have had several vacations this year and we are now in May, even though the budget resolution is supposed to be here April 15. I think before we pass any more laws that allow us to escape the responsibility for carrying out our actions in this body, we ought to do what we are supposed to do.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, going back to the matter at hand, all of us support the concept of volunteers working to help. In fact, this country could not make it without volunteers. I think of those volunteers in the recent disastrous floods in the Dakotas who worked 16- and 20-hour days to pack sandbags, sometimes to protect homes and property and businesses of people they did not know and probably never would know. They just showed up, volunteered, and did it. 
I think what happens, sometimes we will get hit with a vicious storm in my part of the world, power lines will come down, electricity will be out, and people gather to volunteer and help. I think of some people I have seen in times when I have had the opportunity to volunteer in what we call our Cleanup Day. Cleanup Day in Vermont was begun by a dear friend and former Governor of Vermont, Dean Davis. This is where thousands of Vermonters all over the State go out at this time of year--the snows are gone, we hope--and we will pick up trash all over the State, beautify our roads, our streams. 
In fact, I recall when my daughter was the State director, and I went with her and some others. We saw a little piece of metal sticking up in a stream and we decided to pull it, and more of us pulled, and pulled and pulled, and we got a car hooked up and pulled and pulled, and out came a sink--a whole sink. Somebody had tossed it in there. We cleaned it up. I hope that stream was better as a result. 
I think of the men and women who work with children in my State, the volunteers who work with the 4-H Club, for example. During my 8 years as a prosecutor in Vermont, I went back through the records of all those who came in our juvenile courts in the county where I was the States attorney or district attorney. We had about a quarter of the population. During 8 years in that juvenile court, we never had a person in there who had been active in 4-H or active in Scouting. Those people worked so hard at it and learned good basic values, but they had a lot of adults who volunteered to help in those operations. 
I daresay that every single Member of this body is for volunteers. What I am concerned about in this particular bill is that it was introduced, we never had a hearing, we have never had discussion of some of the problems--and there are some significant legal problems in it--and I think that of late the Senate has been acting that way, just taking up a big piece of legislation and rushing to the floor with it. 
I raised a concern that various hate groups might be protected with their volunteers under this bill. The Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Vermont, and all the others both for and against this have a total abhorrence of hate groups. There is not a single Member of this body that will stand for the kind of thing that so many hate groups stand for. 
What I have suggested is they should be looked at carefully. How do you make sure that even beyond the prohibitions against hate crimes that are in the bill that we have the prohibitions against immunizing various hate groups? Do we immunize the volunteers, and do we go further and immunize large organizations that might utilize volunteers and might not take the kind of care they should for the people that come in there, absent those volunteers, or absent that immunization? 
Let me give an example. If you have a large for-profit hospital, the kind of hospital where some of the administrators and owners of it will make millions of dollars a year, where the daily care of the patients--nurses, nurses aides and others, of course, make a tiny infinitesimal fraction of that--are augmented by people who willingly come in and volunteer in those hospitals, who are not the millionaire administrators, do we want to set it up so the millionaire directors are somehow removed from that because 
they were wise enough to bring some volunteers in? Now, I do not think anybody wants to do that. 
So let us look at this legislation. As I said, I think we could have avoided several days of discussion and cloture votes and everything else if we had just done what we normally do or should do around here, and that is have a hearing on it. I am the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and we are not having to take much time for hearings on Federal judges and nominations even though there are 100 vacancies in the Federal courts. We had time to spend the whole day yesterday to beat up on Janet Reno in a hearing. We could have had time to take a couple hours to hold a hearing on this bill and probably corrected the problems and we would have taken up a lot less time of the Senate in the long run. 
I found very interesting the hearing with Attorney General Reno. At the end of 7, 8, or 9 hours, whatever it was, I commended her. She had listened to interminable speeches punctuated by an occasional question. She showed equanimity during the speeches, which made up most of the hearing--speeches from Senators--but also answered the occasional questions with candor and integrity. It does not mean everyone will agree with her answers. 
She sure showed a streak of independence, a streak that may have bothered some, because she showed a willingness to look into inappropriate activity by Members of Congress as well as just at the White House, a matter that I realize has caused some consternation to some on the Hill, but I think it is only fair. If we look at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue, we should look at the other end. I am sure the distinguished Presiding Officer and others would agree with me in that regard. 
Let us go to the bill at hand, let us continue to work together. The Senator from Georgia has been dealing in good faith, and he knows the Senator from Vermont has. We will continue to work and see if we can find something, I hope, very soon. 
I see the Senator from Georgia on the floor, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do wish to thank my friend from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell. With the Coverdell-Leahy-Ashcroft-McConnell and others substitute, I think this piece of legislation has been substantially improved. 
So Members know, we have limited it to individual volunteers. The bill is no longer intended to provide immunity or limitation of liability for organizations. I think it is also important that the original sponsors of the bill agree not to include any limitation on motor vehicle liability, even as it relates to individuals. I think that is important. 
I believe this bill has been significantly modified. It is not precisely the bill I would have written, but it is not precisely the bill my friend from Georgia would have written. I think it reflects what is best in the Senate when both sides can give and come out with something that can be better and more acceptable to a broad cross-section of Senators. Most of us do have concerns if we preempt State laws. In this, we have tried as best as possible to preserve State options. 
I do not believe the threat of litigation deters Americans from volunteering to help neighbors, and did not deter the hundreds and hundreds who volunteered in floods in the Dakotas or in so many other areas we have seen in recent times. I am glad we have been able to limit the reach of the Federal protections provided, but we will be able to help individual volunteers. They should have some insulation from honest mistakes. We all want volunteers to be able to help whenever they can and worry most about how much stamina they will have to help, and have that be their chief concern. 
So we will continue to work on this. Of course, it will have to go through conference, and we will make sure there is no unintended benefit or defenses available to anybody, and that nobody is harmed or left without a remedy. 
We have seen an extraordinary week, as I said, in Philadelphia, with the President of the United States, together with past Presidents, the wife of a past President, General Powell, and others, who came together to promote voluntarism. We do not want to do anything to hamper that. 
Again, I thank my friend from Georgia. I thank Ed Pagano and Jonathan Lamy on the Judiciary Committee staff, and all the others on both sides of the aisle who worked to make this legislation better. 
I am prepared to yield if there is any time left on this side, and am prepared to go to vote on the Coverdell-Leahy substitute.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, I believe that the goal of encouraging voluntarism is a laudable one. I stand ready to work with others on a bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to doing so. This bill, S. 543, is not the answer and appears not even to ask the right question. It is flawed and would benefit from attention through the normal legislative process of hearing, public comment, review, committee consideration, amendment and report, and Senate action. Instead, the majority is trying to force this bill through the Senate to catch the train of press coverage on the Presidents' summit on America's future. 
The contrast between what has taken place in Philadelphia and here in Washington could not be more stark. In Philadelphia, thousands of volunteers and activists are joining with leaders who have served as Presidents from both major political parties, First Ladies, involved celebrities, and corporate sponsors. The summit may well spark a renewed dedication among the millions of Americans to get involved to make a difference. 
Ours is a tradition rich in neighbor helping neighbor and citizen service. The honest involvement of so many and the commitment to improve the lives and futures of 15 million children is extraordinary. 
By contrast, this week the Republican controlled Senate simply cannot abide the nonpartisan events in Philadelphia. I do not know whether it is the involvement of Gen. Colin Powell, Nancy Reagan, George and Barbara Bush, or President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton that is driving the Republican leadership bonkers, but something has. Is it not possible that something happening outside of Washington can have meaning to millions of Americans without congressional Republicans having to insert themselves for partisan gain. I asked yesterday why we are being forced to take up the ill-considered S. 543. The answer is because the Republican leadership says so. Otherwise, they might miss out on claiming credit in connection with this week's activities in Philadelphia. I guess in their minds nothing happens that does not involve their political agenda. Voluntarism should not be about politics. The summit was not partisan and about politics. Unfortunately, this heavyhanded effort is purely partisan. 
I suggest that the 130 cosponsors of all political persuasion who have joined in the approach outlined by H.R. 911 may have a better idea. It is much less of the Federal Government knows best approach that is embodied in S. 543. Indeed, I suspect that sometime soon the Republican majority will try to snuff out this alternative approach to the excesses of S. 543. The House bill is too acceptable an alternative, too widely supported to be tolerated in these partisan times. Only a bill with a pure Republican pedigree will be tolerated in this 105th Congress. How quickly the Republican leadership has forgotten the lessons of legislating through bipartisan cooperation for the good of the country. 
Why is the Federal incursion into State law and local volunteer activity needed? Why is this bill the top priority for Congress? Why has the majority leader threatened to shut down the Senate until this particular bill is passed and devoted an entire week to it? Well, the bill purports to protect volunteers from `liability abuses.' Voluntarism is at an all-time high according to the Wall Street Journal--and that was before the summit in Philadelphia. This morning the principal sponsor of the bill and the majority leader clarified that it is not so much that judgments are being awarded against volunteers or volunteer organizations but that there is a threat of suit. If that is so then why are we being forced to adopt broad-based Federal standards, which by the way will not prevent the filing of lawsuits but only provide a series of Federal law defenses based on factual proof after hearings? 
Why not, instead, encourage the States in their efforts to allow or require indemnification of volunteers for the costs of suit? That is what Georgia and Vermont and many other States have already done. 
Where are the outrageous jury awards against charitable organizations that threaten voluntarism in America? This morning the proponents of this legislation admit that they do not exist. Nonetheless, purportedly in the interests of the beneficiaries of their services, we are being asked to adopt a Federal standard other than the exercise of due care that such activities otherwise might be held to under 200 years of State law development even though the behaviors we are discussing will affect the most vulnerable among us.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the statement notes the President's deep commitment to volunteer and service activities, indeed his AmeriCorps initiation and participation at the summit are both noteworthy examples of his commitment. The statement notes as I have the overbroad definitions in the bill and its unnecessary takeover of State law, among other serious problems. 
The principal sponsor came to the floor this morning to say that the Ku Klux Klan is not included within the bill's definition of nonprofit organizations that would be covered by its provisions. Unfortunately, he did not say why. Wishing does not change the words of the bill. 
To my colleagues who believe S. 543 could not immunize the Ku Klux Klan from liability, let me refer you to a letter to me from Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center. As many of us know, this organization has been on the front lines in the battle against hate groups like the KKK. The Southern Poverty Law Center is acutely aware, probably more so that most of my colleagues, of the hateful acts perpetrated by groups like the KKK. Yet the Senate is considering a bill that would potentially bestow liability immunity upon the KKK. 
I know that every one of my colleagues violently opposes the KKK and would not support liability protection for them, but because we have not been given adequate time to consider this bill, flawed provisions like this overbroad definition remain. 
The definition of nonprofit organizations includes the Government and not-for-profit organizations. Not-for-profit organizations appear to be self-defined to include any organization `conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes.' 
Who decides which groups qualify for limited liability under this definition and what happens when groups like the KKK declare themselves a noncommercial, nonprofit volunteer organization? 
The Southern Poverty Law Center realizes this and opposes S. 543 because they know the Senate bill before us would make it more difficult to prosecute hate groups like the KKK. To quote Morris Dees, the highly respected director of the Southern Poverty Law Center: 
We strongly urge you to withdraw this legislation and vote against any law that limits the ability of our civil justice system to punish those people and organizations that inflict unspeakable injuries on our friends, neighbors, family members and communities. Please, do not help protect white supremacists, neo-Nazi organizations, violence-prone militia groups and others who commit hate crimes.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over a year ago, I began having online computer chats with students from around my home State of Vermont. These chats have been a lot of fun and very informative. The questions that the students have asked me reflect not only their interest in government and current events, but also the advantages that they have in terms of access to knowledge via the information superhighway. 
Just 3 or 4 years ago, I could not have imagined coming back from a vote on the Senate floor, sitting down in front of my computer and having a conversation with a group of young Vermonters over 500 miles away. The advances in technology have amazed me, but so have the understanding students have about technology and what it means for all of our futures. 
Students' questions have ranged from my legislation to protect the privacy of our online communications to United States policy toward Iraq to how to get them out of their next period math test. While I will never be able to help a student skip a math test, these discussions have convinced me of the thirst of our children for the opportunities these technologies represent and our responsibility as leaders to help provide them

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, like many who have volunteered for everything from helping out libraries to volunteering on law enforcement matters, I support the idea of voluntarism, but I oppose the motion to proceed to immediate consideration of S. 543. The merit of this motion seems solely to be the fact that this may be an opportunity to jump aboard the train of the Philadelphia summit on volunteering in America. 
I applaud President Clinton, General Powell, President Bush, President Carter, Mrs. Reagan, and others who were at the summit on voluntarism in Pennsylvania. I hope it will encourage people to continue beyond the time of the weekend. 
We also have some things we are supposed to do in this body. We are supposed to pass a Federal budget. You and I, Mr. President, are required by law to file our income tax returns by April 15. If we do not, we get a knock on the door from the IRS. We are also, as Members of the Senate and Members of the House, required to pass a budget by April 15. The determination of when we start on a budget resolution is determined by the Republican leadership of the House and the Republican leadership of the Senate. Today is April 29 and they have yet to schedule 12 seconds of debate on the budget that the law requires us to have by April 15. 
We have a number of members of the President's Cabinet and subcabinet that we cannot get 18 seconds of debate on, or to vote on them. We have 100 vacancies in the Federal courts. We have only found time--between a number of vacations this year--to confirm two members of the court, even though the Chief Justice has said that the vacancies have created a crisis in the courts of this country. 
Now, America's 93 million volunteers, in the spirit of altruism, should get better treatment than to be used as unwilling partners in a partisan publicity stunt as a way to come up with the fact that the Senate is not doing the work the law requires us to do, the responsibility that we dictate we do. Instead, we have this. 
Here we are, 2 weeks after the Senate missed its deadline to consider the budget, the legislative schedule again stretches before us as a vast desert of inactivity, but now in the vapor, also like a mirage, coming out of the desert, comes this bill. 
Now, why was this particular bill suddenly brought to the floor without any notice, without any hearings, without a committee report? Why was careful scrutiny of this bill avoided by short circuiting the normal process of bringing bills through committee and to the floor of the Senate? Why is this bill being tendered to the Senate and the public like a stowaway, opportunistically cloaked in the camouflage of the week--voluntarism? 
Mr. President, the answer is that this is a bill whose flaws would come to light under the scrutiny of our regular order. If we actually had 20 minutes of hearings, if we actually had a committee report, if we actually had a debate, we would find out the flaws. 
Now, a commendable bill in the other body, which more precisely and thoughtfully addresses the issue which S. 543 purports to address on liability and volunteer work, has been introduced by Congressman John Porter. The Porter bill is being publicly examined through committee hearings, as it should be, and it is a better bill for the examination it is receiving. 
The events this weekend in Philadelphia and for much of the rest of this week are a tribute to the spirit of American voluntarism. It is a magnifying glass that will help spark intensified efforts by all Americans to be better citizens and better neighbors; citizens who will be more willing to give of themselves to make life better in our communities and our Nation. The events in Philadelphia this week are designed to be nonpartisan and inclusive of the interests of all. 
I mentioned those who were there, and I want to express again my gratitude to President George Bush and Barbara Bush for their longstanding leadership in this cause. I remember Mrs. Bush reading to children when they were at the White House and the example that set. It is time to recognize the personal commitment of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter with Habitat for Humanity. They have gone out and worked and actually built houses for people to live in. They have done work around the world. It is time to heed and welcome the calls to action by national leaders such as Gen. Colin Powell, who, by his own life, set such a fine example to appreciate the vision of President Clinton and our First Lady. We see the President, even with his leg in a cast, hobbling over to set an example of helping. 
We should all look forward to the results of the summit, and we should pledge to work in a bipartisan way to consider any recommendations--any recommendations--for legislation that may emerge from this national forum and accept the example of President Clinton and President Bush, of President Carter and Mrs. Reagan, of General Powell and others, to act in a nonpartisan fashion. 
By contrast, the motion by the Republican majority to move to immediate consideration of S. 543, a bill rushed into the hop only days ago, reflects none of the spirit and instead actually is a narrow, partisan effort. Again, we find the Senate ignoring its own duties and responsibilities. We find the Senate ignoring the April 15 date, which by law required the leadership to bring forward a budget resolution. We ignored our duties and responsibilities to confirm Alexis Herman as the Secretary of Labor. We have ignored our responsibilities and duties and allowed this lengthening backlog of judicial nominees to the Federal court--now almost 100 vacancies--in order to tell some others what they should be doing and how. 
This time, what the majority in this body, the Republican leadership, has targeted are the legislatures of the 50 States. What the Senate is trying to tell the State legislatures is that they do not know how to do their business. Big Daddy is right here in Washington. We will tell you how to do it better. Frankly, that might not go over too well with the legislature in Vermont, and I hope it will not in Kansas, Georgia, or anywhere else. Over the last several years, the States have considered and passed a variety of statutes to provide protections they determined advisable to encourage and protect those who volunteer or work for charitable organizations. 
In 1990, President Bush endorsed a model State law to protect volunteers from legal liability, but he did it the right way. President Bush said, `Here is a good law, here is a model law, but we are not going to impose it on the State legislatures. We in Washington are not going to tell the people of Missouri, Georgia, Vermont, Kansas, or anywhere else, how you must do it. We will make the suggestion but your own legislature can make that determination.' 
Amazingly, for once, the Senate of the United States or the House of Representatives was not trying to tell them what they had to do. They were delighted, and they endorsed it. Since 1990, when President Bush made what I thought was a very sensible call, and one I encourage, State legislatures across the country have moved to protect volunteers through enactment of State laws, not something imposed on them from Washington, but something they designed within their own States. At least 44 of the 50 States have enacted some form of volunteer protection from liability. But even though those 44 have been active, we want to come rushing in, with no hearings, no debate, no discussion, no consideration by the States or anything else of legislation, and we say, `Tough luck, your legislatures do not count. Here we are. We will tell you what to do.' 
Why does the Senate of the United States need to take up and pass Federal legislation on this subject on an emergency or expedited basis when we cannot even do the work we are supposed to do? We cannot even get the budget here on April 15 like we are required. We cannot confirm judges. We cannot do anything we are supposed to do. Why are we proceeding to a bill that was only introduced days ago? Why are we proceeding without any hearings or committee consideration? Why are we being forced to proceed without the benefit of a committee report, without an opportunity to study the recent actions of our State legislatures? Can we at least look at what legislatures do before we hit them over the head and tell all these States, `You are not smart enough to do this. We are so much smarter than you are.' 
Do we really want to do that when we have not even had 12 seconds of hearings on this bill? Why is the Republican leadership demanding the Senate consider a law to override the laws of each of our State legislatures designed to protect volunteers and charitable organizations in our States? Why are we being told to just wipe out all the things the State legislatures have done to protect volunteers in their States? The States of Vermont, Georgia, and many others, for example, have already provided protection for directors and officers of nonprofit organizations from civil liability. Do we, in the U.S. Senate, intuitively know better than our State legislatures what is needed? 
Do we know whether the better approach is to require indemnification or mandate insurance or provide limited immunity or help properly to structure acceptance of limitations of liabilities so that State law can serve to encourage charitable efforts without leaving innocent citizens to suffer from wrongful conduct without legal recourse? Have we developed any kind of a record--a page, a paragraph, a sentence, one itsy-bitsy tiny word--on which to justify such a legislative judgment or to justify Federal intrusion into areas that are traditionally matters of local concern? Of course not. 
For a group whose rhetoric is about reducing the role of 
the Federal Government and returning power to the States, the Republican Senate seems awfully sure it knows better than anyone else what the States should pass to encourage local volunteers. You go home and give a speech to the local Rotary Club and say, `We want to give the power back to the States. We want the people to make these decisions; however, we know better than you in the long run, so we will pass this.' For a group that criticizes others for acting as if Washington has solutions to every local problem, the smell of cherry blossoms seems to have gotten to someone. 
I do not know what is wrong with the partial immunity and limited liability laws passed in Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Missouri. I have not seen convincing evidence that vast punitive damage judgments exist to a significant factor in voluntarism, yet we are about to enact a Federal law regime to alter State law and State common law traditions in one ill-considered swoop. 
At least when we considered Senate Joint Resolution 22, the independent counsel resolution, it was only a patently partisan sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It was inappropriate. It demeaned the Senate. But it did not strip rights from individual Americans. 
At least when we considered the substitute for the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act on April 15 to distract from the Republican leadership's failure to produce a Federal budget by that statutory deadline, we at least had previously considered and passed the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act, we had a GAO report noting the continuing problem of IRS employees snooping into confidential tax records, and we limited our action to a Federal agency. 
At least when the Senate discharged the Judiciary Committee from any consideration of S. 495 and engaged in an artificially abbreviated discussion of its provisions in order to get to debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, it did so knowing that we would have an opportunity to reconsider and correct it in the context of implementing legislation for the chemical weapons treaty, 
and at least it concerned Federal law, not State law. But this matter is different. It is not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is not about a Federal agency or a Federal law or a Federal law problem. Instead, it is a repudiation of federalism and the primary role of the States in defining liability laws for local activities. It can have serious repercussions. When we just slap down the States like that and say they don't know enough to do these things, so we will do it for you, we ought to at least consider it substantively. 
There is a slight procedural twist in S. 543. It is technically not being discharged from the Senate Judiciary Committee because it wasn't referred to the committee at all. On April 9, the same group of Republican sponsors introduced the same bill twice, held it on the Senate calendar and allowed the identical twin to be referred to the Judiciary Committee as S. 544. I guess Chairman Hatch and I did not jump quickly enough for their purposes. They get impatient after less than 3 weeks, and here we are on the floor with this ill-considered legislation and, again, we ignored the statutory date to get important legislation out, like the budget, on April 15. 
Now, of course, I did have a chance to read the bill over the weekend. That is a lot bigger opportunity for deliberation than was afforded the Senate when we voted on a substitute version of S. 495 the same afternoon it was offered. So we in the minority are grateful to actually have a chance to do our job. 
I want to point to a couple of problems. I wish to alert the Senate to several aspects of the bill. It may not be apparent from the statement of the sponsors. First, this bill is misnamed. It ought to be called the Ku Klux Klan Protection Act. That is as good an example as any of the nonprofit, `volunteer' organizations that will be the principal beneficiaries of premature consideration of this legislation. The bill's definition of `nonprofit organization' is overly broad and unnecessarily so. If we had had a hearing--something that apparently we no longer do in the Senate; we just bring bills to the floor--do you know what we would have found out about this bill, Mr. President? This bill is going to be supported, I assume strongly, by the Ku Klux Klan, because if you look at the web page of the Ku Klux Klan, look what they say on it: `The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are a noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organization.' And when we knock down all the State laws by passing this to give immunity, who are we giving immunity to? Noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organizations like--oh, I don't know, maybe the Ku Klux Klan. Well, if we had had 20 minutes of hearings on this bill, we might have known that. Isn't this special? In rushing this sucker through, we rush through something that wipes out State laws and imposes our feelings and our judgment to protect noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organizations like `the world's oldest, largest, and most professional whites' civil rights organization, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.' 
Mr. President, look at the picture taken off of the web page of the Ku Klux Klan: `The world's oldest, largest, and most professional whites' civil rights organization * * * a noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organization.' But no matter what kind of laws we might have in Vermont or any other State, this bill would wipe those laws off the books and give them protection. 
I am not suggesting for one moment that this is what the sponsors of this legislation want to do. There is not a single one of these sponsors of this legislation that want to do something to protect the Ku Klux Klan. I think we all know that. But what happens, Mr. President, is that we just rush legislation through because it sounds good and fits in for a good political sound bite for the day, and we haven't had any hearings, haven't done any of the work the Senate is supposed to do. This is what happens--something like this comes slipping through. This is why I oppose this moving forward like this. 
This bill has been so hastily drafted as to provide legal protection to the Ku Klux Klan and its `volunteer members' as well as to all 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations under the Internal Revenue Code and to an untold variety of not-for-profit organizations. 
Who is to decide which groups qualify for limited liability under such a definition? Is it a matter for the organization to declare in its purposes, such as when the Ku Klux Klan declares itself to be a `noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organization'? Is this a matter for the State courts to decide, or is it a Federal question that will be reserved for Federal courts to determine on a case-by-case basis? Is it a matter for the organization to declare its purpose, such as the Ku Klux Klan does when it designates itself to be a noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organization? Do we want Government to decide whether the organization's activities are such that it should be held to be engaged in `civic' or `educational' purposes? Are the State legislatures expected hereafter to pass lists of qualifying or nonqualifying groups or activities? Consistent with the first amendment principles, can Government be directed to make judgments on liability based on the 
political orientation of the group? Should the group on the left be allowed and a group on the right not be allowed, or vice versa? For that matter, how are State legislatures constitutionally permitted to make case-by-case determinations that avoid the constraints of this Federal preemptive statute, such as required by section 3(b) of S. 543? 
I, for one, don't believe victims of hate groups should have to overcome the Federal law immunities that would be created by this bill in order to recover damages done to them. I don't think that somebody who wants to recover damages caused by actions of the Ku Klux Klan against them should have to overcome the prohibitions of this bill. Nor do I believe it is our job to encourage `volunteer' members of the KKK, street gangs, or violent militias, all of which might qualify for not-for-profit and nonprofit organizations under S. 543. 
The overly broad definition of nonprofit in S. 543 might also shield many hospitals from legal liability for actions involving a volunteer. If a not-for-profit hospital uses a volunteer to take down patient information during the admittance process, or to wheel a patient down a hallway, should that hospital be shielded later from liability for medical malpractice? Do we really want to close off remedies for medical malpractice because a hospital used a volunteer and, thus, is insulated under this? 
I don't know that victims of malpractice in not-for-profit hospitals need to overcome special federally imposed immunity rules to recover for their injuries and pain and suffering. In fact, for that matter, I am unaware of a rush to suits against volunteers or any circumstances that cry out for Federal preemption of State law on this subject. We don't have a mess of suits against volunteers going on around this country, where the States are saying: Please come in and save us from ourselves. You can do our jobs so much better than we can. You know so much better. You people are so much wiser in Washington than we are in the State legislatures. Please save us from ourselves. 
I haven't heard a lot of that. Maybe others have, but I haven't. 
When we want to encourage voluntarism to help others, we can do so as we did when we considered and passed legislation to encourage doctors to serve in medical clinics to provide medical services to people who would otherwise do without. Now, that actually helps. 
Last year, we enacted a targeted bill to encourage the delivery of food to the poor and needy when we passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act. It provides food banks to people on the front lines in the war against hunger, with sensible liability protection. We thought it out and did it. 
But this bill, S. 543, is not so targeted. I do not understand, for example, why the Republican sponsors insist on forcing victims of negligent driving by a volunteer for any nonprofit and not-for-profit activity to carry a heavier burden and be denied compensation for their disfigurement and pain and suffering. A victim of an auto accident does not care--if they are crossing the street and somebody goes barreling through a red light and nails you, when you are lying in traction in the hospital, you don't really care that that driver was speeding because he or she was late to a PTA meeting, or a meeting of some trade association. But if they are going to a PTA meeting and nailed you, you may not be able to recover. But if they are going to a trade association, you can. This might be enough to exempt the volunteer driver under volunteer in the bill. 
Many States have excluded motor vehicle injuries from their laws protecting volunteers. The Senators pushing this through to override what the States think, do they really know better than the State legislatures? What makes them think that the potential of a lawsuit for negligent driving is impeding volunteer activity across the Nation? Is it the potential to be liable like any other driver, a liability that I believe all States require a driver to be insured against, which is so affecting national insurance rates, that the Federal Government has to step in and create a Federal immunity? I doubt it. 
I will work with people who want to make a better law. We can do it. We ought to work together to correct the excesses of S. 543. I believe that nobody wants to exempt the Ku Klux Klan, but that is what the bill does. Why don't we find a way that we can work on something, as President Bush did when he put together a model law and passed it on to the States and said, here, use your wisdom and determine what you need in your State. That sets a better way. 
The real volunteer protection act is H.R. 911, legislation introduced by Congressman Porter. This actually has tripartisan support--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--and almost 140 House cosponsors. It is endorsed by the American Heart Association; American Red Cross; Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America; Girl Scout Council USA; Little League; National Easter Seal Society; National PTA; Salvation Army; the United Way; American Diabetes Association; the National Coalition of Volunteer Protection, and a whole lot of others. 
That bill seeks to respect State prerogatives and State law, and it says we are not going to just pound you over the head in Washington and say that we know better, no matter what you think; we are so much wiser than your State legislatures on whether to impose Federal immunities, preempting State law. It offers financial incentives for States to enact model language for limiting volunteer liability. That makes a lot more sense to me. 
If we can achieve the objective in encouraging and protecting real volunteers in direct contact with those who need help, without Federalizing State law, we ought to consider the benefits of that. I know the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and I strongly support the Porter bill as a substitute to S. 543. 
There is no record that our State courts are glutted with liability cases against volunteers. And there is no record that our State legislatures have fallen down on the job and have been ignoring a crisis that threatens voluntarism in our society. Frankly, Mr. President, I am far more comfortable to have the legislature, the general assembly in Vermont determine what makes a good law for Vermont than I am with a law rushed through the Senate with no hearings, virtually no debate. We don't have a Ku Klux Klan chapter in Vermont. At one time in our history, we did. I don't want anything that is going to encourage them to come back. 
Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported last week, on April 23, 1997: `Voluntarism, a classic American solution to social problems, appears to be on the rise.' I think we should tread kind of lightly. The States seem to know what they are doing. They usually do. We should tread lightly before we jump in and give them a slap up alongside the head and take over. 
This bill doesn't just apply to volunteers. In fact, immunizing the negligent conduct of volunteers is a small part of the bill. It also creates a regime of governmental entities, nonprofit organizations and not-for-profit organizations that changes the laws in our 50 States whenever a claim for personal injury is based on the action of a volunteer. 
It would shield myriad organizations from being liable for damages for failing to properly supervise or train or screen their volunteers. 
Suppose you say to the volunteers, take the car and drive down and pick somebody up. Are you screened from liability when they run over somebody? If a group that works with young people fails to investigate reports of sexual abuse by a volunteer and several young girls or young boys suffer abuse, should that organization be immune from sharing the damages for the trauma, suffering and psychological scars these young victims would carry with them the rest of their lives? Is that really a Federal immunity we want to pass? If the Senate wants to immunize them from any liability to those children who might be sexually abused, well, then, let us at least have a hearing on it and make that determination. I, for one, am not willing to give that immunity. 
The House Judiciary Committee last week held a hearing on volunteer liability. They considered H.R. 911 as a proposal to provide exemptions from liability for volunteers, not the supervisory organizations. I do not perceive the compelling need to extend liability protection beyond such volunteers as S. 543 insists. We should be encouraging, not discouraging, nonprofit organizations to properly screen and train and supervise their volunteers. We ought to have fair and balanced legislation on this. 
As a lifelong Vermonter, I am proud and profoundly appreciative of the thousands of volunteers in Vermont, and millions across the country in all our States, whose selfless acts make the world a better place for all of us. The people who spend their weekends preparing dinners for the homeless and the poor, the parents who organize a car wash to raise money for the local PTA, those filling sandbags in flood-threatened areas--these kinds of acts of voluntarism are an essential part of the American social fabric, the kind of voluntarism I learned from my parents growing up as a boy in Montpelier, VT, as so many of the rest of Americans did. Those who volunteer deserve our thanks and encouragement. 
I think if we work together on this and actually have some hearings, we can have broad, strong consensus of Republicans and Democrats to give any needed protection and other helpful encouragement to our volunteers. These really are the heroes of America. These volunteers in service organizations are not asking for a free ride, for a license to behave badly. In fact, I imagine many of them, if they read what is in here, are going to be very offended to have any suggestion that they might want something like this. But S. 543 would encourage free rides and licenses to behave badly. Before we needlessly cut off rights of victims of harmful conduct, we ought to consider whether it is necessary or it is desirable. 
I think what we ought to do is send this bill on for its normal hearings in the Judiciary Committee. Lord knows, we are not doing anything there to get judges out, notwithstanding our 100 vacancies. We could take some time to take a look at this piece of legislation. Let us do that, Mr. President. Let us not rush something through just because it is volunteer week. I would hate to think if next week became organ transplant week; we might find ourselves all being marched down to the Capitol physician's office to donate an organ before we had any--maybe then we would actually ask for a hearing if it affected us that way. This affects a lot more than 100 Members of the Senate. It affects 260 million of our American citizens, 260 million Americans who have gone to their State legislatures and assume their State legislatures know what they are doing. We are saying to those 260 million Americans, `You do not need your State legislatures. You have us.' Well, I do not want us to make this decision without any kind of a hearing. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments of my friends and colleagues on the other side. I wish to recount for the body parts of a conversation I had with the distinguished Senator from Georgia, my good friend, Mr. Coverdell, during the time when the other Senator was speaking. 
I had the pleasure of working with Senator Coverdell when he was in a position where he had to go not only around this country, but around the world seeking volunteers and help in some of the most important aspects of life. So I do not question his commitment to voluntarism. He has lived it and done it. 
My concern, as I expressed to the distinguished Senator from Georgia, is that this bill came to the floor immediately in this fashion with no hearings. I should note for the Record, so there will be no confusion on that, that this is not the decision of the Senator from Georgia or the decision of the Senator from Vermont as to when the bill would come to the floor. That has to be done by the Republican leadership, and I have expressed my concern to the Republican leadership in the past, and will again in the future, that bills cannot come to the floor in that fashion, bills with significant repercussions, with no hearings. 
Frankly, I took exactly the same position during the times I served here when the Democrats were in the majority and would determine what bills would come on the floor. I have been very consistent throughout my career in the Senate. If you have a significant matter, something that is going to affect all of us, take time to discuss it before it comes to the floor. We pass resolutions and sense-of-the-Senate resolutions all the time that say, `on the one hand' this, `on the other hand' that, `God bless America.' Those can move through quickly. But this is a bill, at least the analysis that I have of it and the analysis of totally nonpartisan lawyers who have discussed it with me, which would, in effect, replace State laws. 
I think that the 50 States of the United States should expect no less of the U.S. Senate. If we are going to fetch them a smack up alongside the head and knock their legislative work in the trash can, we ought to at least have a hearing about it and discuss what is involved in it. 
I am perfectly willing to work with the Senator from Georgia and others--as he knows we have worked together on so many issues in the past--on a voluntarism bill, on the question, as I did and others did, with former President Bush on volunteers, but in the normal course of events, with discussion. I hope we will not proceed to this bill today, not to kill the bill, not to kill the act, but to send it back, to at least go through the normal process where we actually have hearings. 
I have discussed the Ku Klux Klan and others. The Ku Klux Klan has had what I think is a vicious and long history in most States. It did in my State of Vermont during the time my parents were younger, and they saw directly the effect of the hate of the Ku Klux Klan. The church where my parents were married and where they were buried--one of them just a year from this coming Monday--the church where I was baptized had the cross of the Ku Klux Klan burned on its front steps. So I know the sense that they have, the sense that my mother of an immigrant family recounted to me of how she felt about that, the fear that was driven in to people who spoke a different language, as my mother and her family did, who practiced a religion very much in the minority in Vermont at that time. 
None of us in this body, Republican or Democrat, wants to encourage in any way racism or the kind of things that the Ku Klux Klan and many other organizations similar throughout this country stand for. There are exceptions on limits and liabilities, those who have been found to violate Federal and States civil rights laws, and so on. 
It is still too broad. If the Ku Klux Klan marches down a street carrying signs, they are not going to be convicted of international terrorism or a hate crime on that, but under the definition in here, they may still well qualify, under their definition, which is under section 6(4)(B): 
. . . any not-for-profit organization organized and conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. 
Because it does not state who is making these kinds of determinations. 
Again, Mr. President, let me make it very clear what my concerns are about this bill. One, it is a major piece of legislation that is on the floor with no hearings, none whatsoever. I understand it is the majority leader who makes that determination, not the Senator from Georgia who was called to be here on the floor and discuss this matter. But we should not have that procedure. We did it once on a major piece of legislation, raising actually worldwide implications on terrorism, a week ago with a bill, a huge bill that everybody 
voted on, either for or against. I doubt there were three Senators who could honestly say when they walked off the floor of the Senate that they had read the bill, because it was presented to us hours, some of us minutes, before we voted on it. But it affected everything from our international relations to our use of antiterrorism legislation, major criminal codes, treaties and everything else--a very thick bill--and we voted on it. I voted against it because it raised enough of a red flag, even though there were parts of the bill that were verbatim from parts of legislation I had written. 
I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but not when it is slapped together and handed to you to vote on matters that have major implications, and we whip it through. In fact, I encouraged the press actually to ask Senators who voted on it if they either read it or knew what was in it. To my knowledge, nobody was asked that question. It would have been interesting to hear the answers, because we all knew the answer. Nobody had. 
Now we have a similar piece of legislation brought up, hurried, no hearings, and pass it, even though it is going to override the efforts of our State legislatures. I have heard so many speeches given about `give the power back to the States; let the States make the decisions. So much wisdom resides in the States.' Why do we say we are the ones who know what is best for the States? Why not let the State legislatures have the ability to make some of these decisions? And then when we are given that chance, we say, `Not you, not you, State legislature, not this particular one.' Actually, this other one, this other one, this other one--actually, not any of the 50 legislatures are smart enough to do the work that the U.S. Senate can do without hearings, without debates and without any kind of a markup on a piece of legislation on the day we come back to work. 
Well, Mr. President, those who vote to go forward with this bill, I ask this question of them; maybe their State legislatures, maybe their State press could ask this question: Of those who vote to go forward with this, are you willing to go back to your State legislature and say that on a piece of legislation that overrides their work, you are willing to vote to do that, even though there have been no hearings on this bill, even though there has been no debate in committee, even though there is no report saying what it does? You are willing to on an act of faith, because the Republican leadership said we have to do this this week, because we have nothing else to do, you are willing to override the efforts of your State legislature? I wonder how many Senators are willing to go back home and say that. I am not. I have too much respect for the Vermont Legislature to do that. I think our general assembly can make this determination. 
So I encourage my friend from Georgia, and others, maybe we can sit down together and try to put together a good piece of legislation, as the Congressman from Illinois, Mr. Porter, has done in the other body, to find a way to do this without trampling on our States. 
I understand there is some concern in the Republican leadership knowing that all Americans had to file their taxes on April 15 because the law requires it, but the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate did not bring forth a budget on April 15, as the law also requires. Maybe we should talk about other things, and with the sterling example of the President and Mrs. Clinton, of President and Mrs. Bush, of President and Mrs. Carter or President Ford or Mrs. Reagan and others, General Powell, who went to Philadelphia, why not just jump on this bandwagon because, politically, who can be against some idea of protecting volunteers? That is not the issue. 
The issue is, do we draw it so broadly that we bring in organizations like the Ku Klux Klan that every single one of us in this body oppose? Do we draw it so broadly that we just knock down our State legislatures and say, `You're immaterial because we 100 Members of the Senate, in our collective wisdom, know a lot more than you do?' Do we draw it so broadly that we do not think of the rights of all individuals, not just a volunteer organization, but the rights of all individuals? Do we give blanket immunity to organizations we do not intend to, like hospitals and others? 
These are questions that should be asked if we have a hearing, but these are the questions that will never be answered if we continue with what I find a very, very disturbing trend in this country to rush major pieces of legislation to the floor with no hearings, no debate and then just ask us to vote on it, especially when we do not have time to fulfill the backlog in the Senate Judiciary on judges. Chief Justice Rehnquist said we have a real crisis because we have about 100 vacancies in the Federal courts, 
and yet we have only filled two of those in 4 months. 
We have taken several vacations, but we have not had time to fill more than two. We have almost a zero population growth in the Federal judiciary. We have not found time to have a minute of debate on the budget, even though the law requires it by April 15. We have a number of other Cabinet officials, from Alexis Herman on, to be blocked. But suddenly we have time to rush forward something that just slaps down our 50 State legislatures, tells them they do not know enough, certainly do not know as much as we do. And we are rushing through with no hearings and no debate. I think we should find a better way to do it. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. I am sorry, I see the Senator from Georgia on his feet. I did not realize that. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need under the hour reserved to the Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. President, today the Senate will exercise its advice and consent authority under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution. We have to decide whether we will advise and consent to the Chemical Weapons Convention that has been the product of negotiations conducted by the Reagan, the Bush and the Clinton administrations. If we advise and consent to it, then President Clinton will be free to ratify the convention. If we do not, of course, he does not have that power to do so. 
Last week I did not object to the unanimous-consent agreement by which the Senate is now finally able to consider the Chemical Weapons Convention. I did comment at that time on the manner in which we are proceeding. We have been forced to take the unusual step of discharging this important treaty from the Foreign Relations Committee without the benefit of committee consideration or a committee report. And, what is most extraordinary, is that it is the Republican leadership for the Republican majority that has insisted on this extraordinary procedure. 
Last week we were required to discharge the Judiciary Committee from any consideration of S. 495, a bill that was taken up last Thursday with no committee consideration, no committee report, and an absolute minimum of debate. In fact, the Senate was asked to consider a revised, unamendable substitute version of the bill that was not made available to us until that very afternoon. I raised concerns that it might, in fact, serve to weaken criminal laws against terrorism. I daresay at least 90 out of the 100 Senators who voted on S. 495 last week had not read it and probably did not have much idea of what was in it. 
I mention this because we have taken a lot of time for recesses this year but we did not come up with a budget on April 15, even though the law requires us to do so. The leadership decided not to bring one before the Senate to vote on. Each one of us had to file our taxes on April 15, or the IRS would have come knocking on the door, but even though the law requires the leadership to bring up a budget bill, none was. I am not suggesting we not bring up the Chemical Weapons Convention now. It should have been brought up last September. But I worry that the Senate is suddenly doing this, launching into issue after issue, not following the kind of procedures that would enable us to really know what we are talking about. I suggest that we should be looking at the way we have done this. 
In 1988 I chaired hearings on the threat of high-tech terrorism. I continue to be concerned about terrorist access to plastique explosives, sophisticated information systems, electronic surveillance equipment, and ever more powerful, dangerous weapons. With the sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system 2 years ago, we saw the use of harmful chemicals to commit terrorist acts. 
In our Judiciary hearings in 1988, 1991 and 1995, we heard testimony on easily acquired, difficult to detect chemical and biological weapons and explosions. On April 17, 1995, the date of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, we all learned how easy it is for somebody, intent on terrorism, to concoct a lethal compound out of materials as easily available as fertilizer. 
So, for more than a decade I have raised issues about the threats of nuclear, biological and chemical terrorism. I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to minimize those threats. We have cooperated on measures included in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, and the Antiterrorism Act, passed in April of last year. We have concurred on those. Assuming we advise and consent today, and I think now that we will--I think some who wanted to hold it up realize that this is not the kind of posture they want to be in, especially as a party going into elections next year--but, assuming that we advise and consent and the President can ratify it, I look forward to working with Senator Hatch to promptly consider and report implementing legislation that will continue the progress we are making today. 
I look forward to hearings in the Judiciary Committee on S. 610, having that committee consider that measure and report it to the Senate before the Memorial Day recess. 
I do not expect the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to bottle up this measure or to deny the Senate the benefit of our committee's views. I am going to try to get something approaching regular order. We have not on anything else yet this year, but maybe on this issue we could. 
We have had the Chemical Weapons Convention before us since November 1993. As the April 28, 1997, deadline approaches--after which our lack of ratification risks economic sanctions against our chemical industry that would actually cost U.S. chemical companies hundreds of millions of dollars--I hope the Republican majority will join with the President and ratify it, and allow him to sign this treaty. I understand all Democrats will vote for it. I hope enough Republicans will, too. 
In fact, our good friend and former colleague, Senator Bob Dole, endorsed ratification yesterday. I hope others are now going to follow him, because, really, we are deciding whether the United States will be a member of a treaty that goes into effect on April 29, with or without us. No matter what we do on the floor of the Senate, this treaty goes into effect on April 29. If we do not advise and consent, the United States will be left on the outside of the world community, with states like Iraq and Libya, which have refused to become parties to this important arms control measure. It is a fascinating situation, Mr. President. If we do not advise and consent, we can say we are standing shoulder to shoulder with Iraq and Libya because we did not join the chemical weapons treaty. This is one of the most ambitious treaties in the history of arms control. It bans an entire class of weapons, which have been one of the great scourges of the 20th century. In fact, this, along with antipersonnel landmines, have been among the greatest scourges of 20th century warfare. This treaty prohibits a full spectrum of activities associated with the offensive use of chemical weapons, including the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling and assistance to anyone engaging in these activities. 
The convention creates a comprehensive verification regime which makes it easier to detect and monitor emerging chemical weapons threats. The vigorous verification procedures established in this treaty will help deter countries from developing chemical weapons, and will make it more likely that cheaters are detected. Those nations that do not ratify it, and we could be among them, will be subject to trade sanctions. Nonparticipating nations will also face increasing international pressure to comply, as their number dwindles to an unsavory few. I hope the United States will not be one of those unsavory few. 
In the last day, I have heard preposterous statements from the Senate floor about what damage this treaty will do to our national security, about what a burden it will be on American business--the same businesses that are hoping that we will advise and consent to it; about how rogue states will suddenly produce unconstrained amounts of chemical weapons to use on our soldiers. Others eloquently exposed these charges for what they are: flat-out false. 
What this debate is really about is how we monitor the rest of the world to ensure the use of these weapons is deterred and minimized. For we all know, the United States by law is committed to destroying our own chemical stockpiles by 2004. We are doing this because we know that these weapons have limited military utility and because civilized people around the world agree their use is morally wrong. And the United States is not going to use them. 
So, how do we encourage other states to do what we are going to do anyway? Should we go at it unilaterally or multilaterally? Do we want American inspection teams to mount short notice inspections of potential violators or not? Do we want international penalties to apply to those who flout this treaty or not? Are we safer if the Russians destroy their 40,000 tons of chemical weapons, or not? Do we join with the 74 nations who have ratified this treaty, and the 162 countries that have signed it, or not? Or, does the United States, the most powerful nation in the history of the world, choose, somehow, to go it alone, with all the problems that would entail? 
Let us not forget that the United States had a primary role in designing and shaping this treaty, from the time it was first 
proposed by President Reagan. In recent weeks, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, working in concert with the Clinton administration, has worked very hard to address the concerns that some Members of this body have. Yesterday we passed 28 declarations to the resolution of ratification that provide even greater protections to U.S. business, and our soldiers, and those who are concerned about constitutional violations. 
Shortly, we are going to vote to strike five other conditions that opponents of the treaty say are necessary to address their concerns. I hope that, rather than addressing their concerns, we address the concerns of the United States. Those five conditions should be seen for what they are, treaty killers, designed by those who have no desire to see us participate in this treaty, no matter how many modifications we make. 
I want to speak briefly about two of the amendments. The distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, has been very insistent on them. They are important with respect to this treaty, and also with respect to the issue of antipersonnel landmines. That is a matter of special importance to me. 
Proposed condition 29 would, among other things, prohibit the United States from ratifying the treaty until Russia has done so. Proposed condition 30 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the treaty until all States having chemical weapons programs, including China, North Korea, and Iraq, have ratified the treaty. In other words, we would say that China, North Korea, and Iraq would determine the timetable for the United States. Can you imagine that in any other context? We would be screaming on this floor. Of course we would not allow that to happen. These conditions would effectively prevent the United States from ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention and allow the world's most recalcitrant regimes to decide the rules of international conduct. 
To its credit, the administration strongly opposed these amendments. It argues, and I agree, that we should ratify the treaty even before Russia does, and even assuming that rogue States like Iraq and Libya and North Korea do not. In other words, even if these other nations which could easily produce chemical weapons do not join the treaty, the United States should still do so. Why? Because, by ratifying the treaty we isolate the rogue nations, we make it harder for them to produce and use chemical weapons. And, were they then to do so, if all of us had joined in this convention and they moved outside the convention, they would suffer international condemnation and sanctions. 
In support of this argument the administration has turned to some of our most distinguished military and national security leaders. Let me quote what they are saying about linking our ratification to Russia's or to the actions of such nations as China and Iraq. 
Gen. Brent Scowcroft and former CIA Director John Deutch say:  
[U.S. failure to ratify] gives Russia--which has the world's largest stock of chemical weapons--an easy excuse to further delay its own accession to the CWC. 
Former Secretary of State James Baker says:  
[S]ome have argued that we should not contribute to the treaty because states like Libya, Iraq and North Korea, which have not signed it, will still be able to continue their efforts to acquire chemical weapons. This is obviously true. But the convention . . . will make it more difficult for these states to do so. . . . It makes no sense to argue that because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention, the United States should line up with them, rather than the rest of the world. 
Secretary of Defense William Cohen says: 
[T]he CWC will reduce the chemical weapons problem to a few notorious rogues. . . . 
And last, but certainly not least, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf has said: 
We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future wars. And frankly, by not ratifying that treaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea, and I'd just as soon not be associated with those thugs in that particular battle. 
I agree with General Schwarzkopf. I do not want to have the United States lumped in with Libya and North Korea on the CWC. 
By ratifying the treaty, we and the overwhelming majority of nations establish the rules by which the conduct of nations is measured. 
Will some nations violate the treaty? Perhaps. But that is no more reason to oppose ratification than it would be to oppose passage of other laws outlawing illegal conduct. We pass laws all the time, criminal laws in this country, and treaties, that say what shall be a crime or a violation of the treaty. We do not withhold passing them because somebody might break that law. It is one of the main reasons we do pass a law, to try to deter unacceptable conduct. 
And by isolating the rogue nations, we pressure them to refrain from producing or using chemical weapons. When they tire of being branded outlaws, they may even join in ratifying the treaty and complying with it themselves. 
The arguments we hear on the floor from some today in opposition to this also apply to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Not all nuclear powers are signatories to that treaty. But the effect of the treaty is a powerful disincentive on any state, signatory or not, from testing nuclear weapons. We know there are some countries today that have nuclear weapons. They have not signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, but because the major countries have, it limits their own scope of activity. 
These treaties were the subject of many, many years of negotiations, negotiations that went nowhere until the United States said that it would renounce the use of chemical weapons, and stop nuclear testing. And once the United States said that, then negotiations were pursued vigorously. The treaties were signed within a few years time. 
I commend the administration and other proponents of the CWC for arguing so strongly and effectively in favor of ratification. The President has made the case very, very well, and members of his administration have too. 
I would say with some irony though, this is precisely the argument that I have been using on antipersonnel landmines. I could repeat verbatim what the President, the White House staff, the Secretary of Defense, General Schwarzkopf, and former Secretary Baker have said. These arguments apply lock, stock, and barrel to the problem of antipersonnel landmines. We all want Russia and China to be part of a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. But that is not going to happen any sooner than Iraq is going to sign the chemical weapons treaty. 
Their failure should not be used as an excuse for the United States not to sign a treaty banning antipersonnel mines when 100 other nations, including many that have produced and used landmines or have been devastated by their effects, are ready to sign such a treaty. 
When the administration on the one hand says we have to go forward with the Chemical Weapons Convention--and I agree--even though some countries, the worst ones have not yet joined, it is unfortunate that the administration then turns around and says we cannot do the same thing with antipersonnel landmines until everybody joins in. 
No treaty is universal. In fact some treaties have taken effect with only 20 signatories. But by establishing the international norm, the rogue nations are isolated and pressure builds on them to sign. And that is the only way. 
So I ask, Mr. President, why does the administration argue one way on chemical weapons but not follow through on its argument when it comes to antipersonnel landmines? Landmines are just as indiscriminate. 
Why, when many more American soldiers and many more innocent civilians, Americans and others, have been killed and horribly maimed by landmines than by chemical weapons? 
The reason, of course, is we pushed for the Chemical Weapons Treaty because we have already renounced our own use of chemical weapons, just as we pushed for the Test Ban Treaty because we had renounced our own nuclear tests. But we have not yet renounced our use of antipersonnel landmines. 
If we did do so, if the United States were to renounce its use of antipersonnel mines, as so many other nations have done, including many of our NATO allies, I guarantee that the administration would make exactly the same arguments in support of a treaty banning those weapons as it is making in support of the CWC. 
They would say that we should not allow Russia, China, and others to decide what the rules of international conduct should be. They would say it makes absolutely no sense that because a few pariah nations refuse to join a landmine ban the United States should line up with them rather than the rest of the world. And they would say that a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines would reduce the landmine problem to a few notorious outlaws and make the world safer for all its people. These are the arguments they made on the Chemical Weapons Convention. They are right. They also would be right in making these same arguments in support of a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. 
In fact, Mr. President, in a letter to the New York Times today by Robert Bell, the Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms Control, National Security Council, Mr. Bell wrote: 
We will be in a much stronger position to make sure other parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention do the same if we are inside, not outside a treaty.

Mr. LEAHY. I agree with Mr. Bell, and I know he worked tirelessly on the CWC. But unfortunately, Mr. Bell, who I am sure is well motivated, has not been willing to apply that same argument to antipersonnel landmines. The Vice President will not apply that argument. Many of the same people who are up here arguing for the Chemical Weapons Convention make one argument for the Chemical Weapons Convention and turn that argument completely around when it comes to antipersonnel landmines even though we face a grave danger, every day, from antipersonnel landmines. 
There are 100 million of antipersonnel landmines in the ground in 68 countries, where every few minutes somebody is maimed or killed by them. This is, in many ways, a greater danger to innocent people than chemical weapons. And I wish the administration, I wish Mr. Bell, I wish the Vice President, I wish others who have not made their same arguments on antipersonnel landmines that they do on chemical weapons will reconsider. Because, like chemical weapons, antipersonnel landmines are weapons we do not need. 
What we do need are defenses against them, because, like chemical weapons, they are easy and cheap to produce. They pose a grave threat to our troops. They are the Saturday night specials of civil wars. They kill or maim a man, woman or child every 22 minutes every day of the year. They are aptly called weapons of mass destruction in slow motion. In fact, they are the only weapon where the victim pulls the trigger. They are a weapon where one Cambodian told me, in their country they cleared their landmines with an arm and a leg at a time. 
I am proud to support the President, the Vice President, and the rest of the administration on the Chemical Weapons Convention. But I hope that they will soon take the same position on antipersonnel landmines and say, let us bring together the like-minded states--and there are many who are ready to join in a treaty to ban them, join with them, and then put the pressure on the other countries like Russia and China and so on who will take longer to do it. 
If American children were being torn to pieces every day on their way to school, or while playing in their backyards, we would have made it a crime long ago. It is an outrage that should shock the conscience of every one of us. 
So I am going to vote to advise and consent to the Chemical Weapons Convention so the President can ratify it and to exert the leadership necessary to help rid the world of the scourge of chemical weapons. I look forward to ratification and to the implementation legislation to make the treaty a reality. 
And I will also continue to work to convince the administration this is the kind of leadership we need if we are to rid the world of antipersonnel landmines--a scourge every bit as horrifying as chemical weapons, frankly, Mr. President, a scourge that is killing more people today and tomorrow and last year and next year, and on and on, than chemical weapons. We should be leading the world's nations to end the destruction and death caused each day by landmines, not sitting on the sidelines. 
I will conclude, Mr. President, by quoting from a letter to President Clinton signed by 15 of this country's most distinguished military officers, including Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf; former Supreme Allied Commander John Galvin; former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, David Jones, and others. They said:  
We view such a ban [on antipersonnel landmines] as not only humane, but also militarily responsible. 
I quote further: 
The rationale for opposing antipersonnel landmines is that they are in a category similar to poison gas. . . . they are insidious in that their indiscriminate effects . . . cause casualties among innocent people. . . . 
They said further: 
Given the wide range of weaponry available to military forces today, antipersonnel landmines are not essential. Thus, banning them would not undermine the military effectiveness or safety of our forces, nor those of other nations. 
Mr. President, every single argument the administration has made in favor of us joining the Chemical Weapons Convention could be made to ask us to go to Ottawa to sign a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. Because by doing that, we would have 90 percent of the nations of this world pressuring the remaining 10 percent, and that pressure would be enormous. 
I reserve the balance--

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I will be very brief. Mr. President, I appreciate efforts of the Senator from Utah to get order, and that is no more than I could expect for somebody that bears certain similarities to the Senator from Vermont. 
Earlier, the distinguished Senator from Delaware read a long list of staff and Senators and others who deserve praise for getting us as far as we are. The name of the distinguished Senator from Delaware is notably absent, and I think that those who support the CWC owe a debt of gratitude to the Senator from Delaware. In the customary practice, he left his own name off, but if I might add his name to the record and put it in. 
Mr. President, I am, as you know, a supporter of the CWC. Again, I compliment what we have done. As in the test ban treaty, when countries were not coming forward, the United States unilaterally banned their own tests and then other countries joined us--not every country that has nuclear capability, but other countries did join us--and we brought the pressure forward for a test ban treaty. 
The United States took an initiative with chemical weapons. We banned our own use, unilaterally. When we did that, other countries joined us. Not all countries, but other countries, most countries, joined us. 
Now if we vote to advise and consent on this treaty we will have pressure, the pressure of the most powerful Nation on Earth, joined by all these other countries, pressure on the few rogue countries who have not done that. I say that, Mr. President, because there is one other weapon, a weapon that kills and maims far more people than chemical weapons. That is the weapon of antipersonnel landmines. There are 100 million landmines in over 65 countries today. As one person told me, in their country, they clear these landmines an arm and a leg at a time. Every 22 minutes an innocent civilian--almost always a civilian--is killed or injured by an antipersonnel landmine. The United States should now do the same thing they did. 
The United States should do the same thing we did with chemical weapons. We should move unilaterally, ban our own use, ban our own export, ban our own production of antipersonnel landmines, expand on the Leahy legislation already passed by the House and Senate. Do that and then join with like-minded nations. There are tens of like-minded nations that have already done that. 
Join with them, agree, together, that this is what we will do. It will not be every nation. It will not be some of the nations most needing to do this like Russia and China, but we will have the same moral suasion that we have with the chemical weapons convention. We can do it with chemical weapons and should. Now let us follow exactly the same step, join with the Canadians and others and do it with antipersonnel landmines. This country is capable of it. It would be a moral step. It would be a dramatic step that would help the innocent civilians who die from that. 
I withhold the balance of my time and yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not use all of that time, only to say this. We will advise and consent so the President can ratify this treaty. I truly believe we will. It will show the moral leadership that the Senate should show and that the United States should show. We will act as the conscience of this Nation, and we will advise and consent to this treaty. We will show the moral leadership because we began this by saying we would act unilaterally, if need be, renouncing our own use of chemical weapons with or without a treaty. That was true leadership. 
Not all countries are going to join with us. But most did join with us on this, and we should be proud of that leadership that brought them together. We will never have all of the countries with us, but we know that it is in the best interests of the United States to do this. 
I suggest, after we do this, Mr. President, that we should again look at the question of antipersonnel landmines and show the same moral leadership to get countries to join with us--not all countries will--to ban antipersonnel landmines which kill and injure far more people than chemical weapons. 
Mr. President, I will vote for advice and consent of this treaty so the President can ratify it. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have noted on the floor of the Senate a number of times, the crisis in our Federal judiciary that Chief Justice Rehnquist has spoken of. The Chief Justice and others have spoken about the nearly 100 vacancies in our Federal judiciary at the district court level, at the court of appeals level, and at the Federal court of appeals level. So far in this Congress--we have been in session now for 4 months--we have confirmed only two Federal judges. It is a form of zero population growth, as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned. We seem to have this idea that if we do not get Federal judges we can, somehow--I am not sure what we think we are going to do. 
I will tell you one of the things we have not done. In a number of jurisdictions we are reaching a crisis situation where, instead of being able to have criminal cases tried, instead of prosecutors being able to seek tough penalties, they have to plea bargain because they know they must keep up with speedy trial mandates, yet there are not enough judges to have a speedy trial, so they end up having to plea bargain. We do know that in many, many jurisdictions it is clearly impossible to have a civil case heard. If you are a business person with a just claim against somebody and you want to bring a suit, bring the suit, but they can just wait you out. If you are a litigant who has been damaged by somebody, you want to bring a suit, they can just wait you out because the judges are not there to try the cases. 
I think it is irresponsible for the leadership in this body to continue to block Federal judges. This is something that I have never seen in 22 years here. During times when the Democrats were in control of the Senate when there was a Republican President, we have never done it to them. During times when Republicans have been in control of the Senate, they have not done this. But this time it is being done. It shows a lack of responsibility on the part of the Senate. It shows a lack of responsibility on the part of individual Senators that they allow this to continue. It also shows a demeaning of the Senate. It violates the traditions of the Senate. 
There are some who do not care for traditions in this body. Sometimes it is in things that the public does not see, like confining the reporters of debates to something that looks like a subterranean, medieval torture chamber because we want to expand the perks and privileges of some of the officers of the Senate. 
I would hate to think that the Senate is willing to toss aside decades, generations of tradition for momentary perks and privileges. I hope Senators will start thinking that none of us owns the seat in the U.S. Senate. None of us owns a piece of the U.S. Senate. We are merely 1 of 100 who serve here and we serve here for all Americans, not just for our partisan interests, not just for our political party's interests, not just for our own personal aggrandizement. We serve here for the whole country. We are not serving the country well on the question of judges. 
This is something where judges, both Republican and Democrat appointed, are united in saying it is not responsible the way we have maintained this. Mr. President, I will continue to speak out on this, but I hope we will wake up to the fact that the country needs to have these Federal judges. We should be ready to move forward. We have about 25 in the pipeline. 
Let us start having hearings and start going forward on them. Let us stop playing political games. We have a woman, one of the most qualified members of the California bar, who has found her appointment blocked. Contrary to the normal tradition of hearing nominees for the circuit court first, she was made to wait behind everybody else here recently. As did not escape notice, she was also the only woman nominee and was treated like a second-class citizen on the hearing schedule. She has now been asked by a Member of the Senate, basically, to tell how she voted on over 100 items in California. 
Are we stooping so low as a body that we are asking people how they voted? If they are up for confirmation, how they cast a secret ballot? Would you, Mr. President, want to have somebody go back for the last 20 years and ask how you voted every time you went to the voting booth in Kansas? I certainly would not want anybody to be able to ask that. I am very proud of all the votes I cast, but it is my business. It is not anybody else's business. One of the great hallmarks of this democracy is the secret ballot, and we should not start asking people that, when actually it appears the real reason is just to keep the stall in. 
We have followed, in the past, the so-called Thurmond rule of stalling a President's appointments to the judiciary in about the last few months of their term in office. I have never seen the stall start in the first few hours of a President's 4-year term.

Mr. LEAHY. On another issue, Mr. President, since the first Earth Day in 1970, Americans have gathered to celebrate the steps we have taken to clean up our environment and to call attention to what still needs to be done. The early Earth Day events helped create the modern environmental movement. They led directly to enactment of the first major environmental legislation, the Clean Air Act. I remember with pride serving here with Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, knowing what he had done to help spark that movement. 
But I ask Senators and the administration to look back at the debate that took place when we drafted this remarkable piece of legislation. At the time of that first Earth Day, the laws to limit air pollution were disjointed, they were limited in scope. But since passage of the Clean Air Act, we have made considerable strides in reducing some pollutants. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago--one-tenth. We have healthier children as a result. In fact, just using that figure itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. 
One thing we do know is Americans do not want to stop the progress we made and say, look what we did back then, 10 years ago; it is what we do today to keep moving forward in cleaning up our environment. I have heard some of the debate here in the Congress now, on the Clean Air Act, that it is not to strengthen it, not to make it better based on what we learned, but rather to weaken it. It is almost like saying we took care of those children, but tomorrow's children we are unwilling to help. 
We also learned the ecosystem is not static and that environmental progress should not be either. There is no status quo and never should be a status quo when it comes to a healthy environment. New pollution sources appear, and none of us can predict today what the new pollution sources might be a decade from now. We know populations grow and they shift and pollutants accumulate. So, if you are not always moving toward a safer and cleaner environment, then you are slipping backwards. 
The EPA conducted a 5-year review of existing standards and compared these with new scientific research about the tiny particulates and ozone that we breathe. When EPA issued new goals to lower the level of these particulates coming into our lungs and the ozone levels, the backlash was remarkable. Opponents instantly attacked the goals rather than sitting down to work with the Congress and administration to achieve these goals in a reasonable and cost-effective timeframe. Instead of saying, `What do we do to make air and water safer for our children?' it was, rather, `We cannot possibly do this.' These are the same people who would do anything to save a child, but not to save the Nation's children. 
We ought to listen to the voices of more than 130 million Americans in 170 major cities who continue to breathe unhealthy air, including the city we are in today. When the Clean Air Act was drafted, we were unwilling to accept the argument that the present cost of environment regulation should define the future of our environment. Our late colleague, Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine said, `The first responsibility of Congress is not the making of technological or economic judgments. Our responsibility is to establish what the public interest requires to protect the health of persons.' 
So, on this Earth Day I ask Senators to go back to the 
original premise of the Clean Air Act and ask ourselves what do we do to carry forward the torch of environmental progress, not only for ourselves but for the next generations of Americans? I hope we might look at the biggest loophole in the Clean Air Act, allowing the dirtiest powerplants to continue to operate with vastly inadequate pollution controls. We ought to go back and close this loophole now, in this session of Congress. 
One of the reasons it is so urgent is because of the deregulation of the electric utility industry. We have the benefits of competition in the utility industry. Some say it is going to be as much as $50 billion. Surely, with this we ought to be able to offset the environmental costs of utility deregulation and have some ability to have cleaner air. 
We ought to look at some of the coal-fired production plants that were grandfathered under the Clean Air Act. One study says an annual increase of emissions of 349,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, a component of ozone pollution, comes from them. 
Let us look at what happens here. We have plants that have been grandfathered in. That means they are allowed to spew whatever they want. These plants are out here. You see the pictures of them. But where do the pollutants go from these 25 grandfathered plants? They move, of course, east. Many of the plants are in the Midwest or toward the West, but the pollutants move east. 
If we are going to talk about what we do with the Clean Air Act, let us think of our children. My children are going to live most of their lives in the next century. But if we allow this to go on with no changes, those who live in this part of our country are going to be severely damaged and those children who are going to live most of their lives in the next century are going to feel the results of it. 
I have talked about the high environmental standards we have in Vermont. Each State and community should take responsibility for controlling pollution within their borders. We have done this in Vermont, implementing some of the toughest environmental laws in the Nation. But, even though we have imposed high environmental standards on ourselves, we Vermonters are faced with an uphill battle when the pollution we are striving to control silently creeps into our State each night with the wind. We Vermonters are deeply concerned about what is being transported by air currents. 
We Vermonters are deeply concerned about what comes with the wind at night when we are sleeping from other parts of this country. Acid rain taught us that our tough environmental standards were not enough to protect us. We saw some of our healthiest forests die off from pollution borne from outside our region. This is an experience from which everybody can learn. Increased power generation at these 25 dirtiest plants is going to affect air quality across the country. We learned from the acid rain debate that emissions from these plants could be transported more than 500 miles. 
Let us look here. Here are the 25 top polluters. This is where the pollution is going. If you look at this, you can see from the 25 top polluters, our part of the country is being hit especially hard. My own State of Vermont, with the toughest environmental laws you are going to find anywhere, cannot protect ourselves by our own laws because these pollutants come across by every wind that comes over Vermont from the west, carrying those pollutants. 
There is no fence, there is no law that we Vermonters can set up to protect us, but we in the Congress can protect all the people in this region. 
I will also say, Mr. President, if we do not look at these grandfathered plans, it is not only the Northeast that is going to be affected, all parts of the country are going to see their air quality diminished. 
In the case of acid rain, some areas are more vulnerable to damage than others because of their geology. The rocky soils of Canada and much of the Northeast means that we have less ability to buffer the acids, so our lakes will die sooner. But in the case of ozone, we are dealing with children, not lakes or forests. As I said, my children will live most of their lives in the next century, and I think about that all the time. I also think children are the same, whether they are Canadians, Vermonters, or Ohioans. Children in Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia, and other States are just as vulnerable as those in Canada and Vermont. 
I called on the administration a year ago to develop a mitigation program to address increased air pollution associated with utility restructuring. To date, nothing has been proposed. I do not think we can wait any longer. This train is leaving the station and, unfortunately, it is a polluting train. 
More than 10 States are already developing restructuring legislation. Two States are implementing open competition. With more than $50 billion in expected benefits from competition, we should be able to afford the costs of ensuring clean air for our children. A number of proposals have been addressed in the House, but none addresses this problem. The administration has not proposed a solution to it. I hope that proposal will come. I will see what provisions it makes. 
Earth Day reminds us that we share the air, the water and our planet. There can be no greater legacy that we leave behind for our children and our grandchildren than a society that is secure in its commitment to a healthy and environmentally sound future. 
On this Earth Day, I want all of us in Congress to stop thinking only in regional terms of the Clean Air Act and the potential benefits and costs from utility restructuring. We all share in the responsibility to leave behind for the next generations a healthy environment. The only way we are going to be successful is to look at the quality of our air, water, and ecosystems in wider terms. We have to address the loopholes that allow these dirty plants to churn out tons of pollutants for the last 20 years. We cannot afford them a free ride into the next century. 
Let me point out once more, we are not in this alone. The plants are here, but the pollutants go across our country. I say this today because the President is going to North Dakota, actually a place where two of these plants are. He will go representing our whole country and grant aid to the people who have been badly hurt. Any one of us, from whatever State we come from, when we look at the pictures on television and read the news accounts of what those people in North Dakota have gone through, our hearts have to ache for them. 
When a town is hit with both flood and fire, it is almost like a Biblical reference to devastation. We will, as a great nation, as we always do in matters of major disasters, come together and we will help. Vermonters will help the people in North Dakota, as will Kansans and Californians and everybody else. But it is one thing when you see a disaster that happens all at once. Unfortunately, there is a disaster in air pollution that happens drip by drip, day by day, and if we allow these pollutants to continue to drift across our Nation, those of us who are in the East and Northeast also face a disaster, a disaster not of our making but a disaster of our Nation's making, a disaster that may not have a great effect on me, as I stand here in my fifties, but it will on the children of Vermont and it will on their children's children. 
This country can be justifiably proud of the steps it has taken in environmental quality. When I look at the newly democratic nations of Eastern Europe and I see how they struggle with health costs and development costs based on their own ignoring of the environment for the last several generations, I think how fortunate we are that we have been way ahead of that in this country, but also know that we have a long, long way to go. 
Let us look at this, not for those in my generation, necessarily, but those in my children's generation. Let us look for those who are going to live most of their lives in the next century. That is something this Congress can do. Democrats and Republicans alike should join together and that is a legacy we can leave. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we hear people complain about how foreign aid is a waste of money, and there are certainly examples of it. The United States poured countless millions of dollars into the pockets of President Mobutu, and one need only observe the chaos and suffering in Zaire today to understand what a terrible mistake that was. Many of us said so at the time, but we were ignored. During that same period, the United States propped up General Noriega in Panama, until he was no longer useful to us. 
But you do not hear very much about the good uses of foreign aid, and how it makes a difference between life and death, or hope and misery, for millions of people around the world. In fact, there are far more examples of those good uses, than of the scandals that attract the attention of the media. 
One example is the War Victims Fund project in Uganda. This project began in 1989, and it is now coming to an end. I think Members of Congress and the public should know about it, because it is a remarkable example of what the U.S. Government, a private voluntary organization, the good will and hard work of American volunteers, and the support of the Government of Uganda, have done for the benefit of thousands of wounded and severely disabled people in that country. 
Uganda, a once productive country that boasted the finest medical school in sub-Saharan Africa, was virtually destroyed by the disastrous Idi Amin and Obote regimes. The medical school was destroyed, its faculty members killed or run out of the country. Years of civil war left thousands of casualties, including many victims of landmines. 
In 1989, the year the Leahy War Victims Fund was established, USAID began a project in Uganda. It was implemented by Health Volunteers Overseas, a Washington, DC-based organization that sends volunteer doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals to train people in poor countries. 
Health Volunteers Overseas did an extraordinary job in Uganda during the 7-year life of this project. There were tremendous achievements, and one terrible tragedy when Dr. Rodney Belcher, the Virginia orthopedic surgeon without whom the project would not have accomplished nearly so much, was gunned down in a robbery. His loss was felt throughout Uganda, because so many people knew of his selflessness, and that he had literally given his life for them and future generations in that country. His legacy is the scores of Ugandan health professionals he trained who are carrying on his work today.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the concern of the Senator from Arizona and others in wanting to move forward with S. 495. 
Frankly, Mr. President, we may be seeking a greater good here on the chemical weapons treaty. Those who are opposed to it will feel that it isn't important that they have a chance to vote against it; but those who are for it, as am I, will feel it is important to have a chance to vote for it. 
But S. 495 in my mind does not have such urgency. 
In an effort to cooperate with the Democratic leader, and with the Republican leader, who is seeking to fulfill, I think, a responsible commitment to the President of the United States to have this bill up here, or to have the treaty up here, I did not object to S. 495, the Kyl bill, coming up. But, Mr. President, I would point out that this is a bill that was introduced--the first version of it was introduced and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee a day or two before our last recess. 
There has never been a hearing on it. There has not been 21 seconds of debate on it in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and today we have before us a 70-page and a 70-page substitute for it. We are going to be asked sometime in the next few minutes to vote on a substitute for S. 495. We are going to be asked to vote on a bill that has had no hearings, no debate in committee, no markups, no votes, no report, and no discussion. 
I am willing to wager that there will not be more than five Senators who can walk off the floor and tell people honestly, looking them straight in the eye, and say they read it and understood what is in it. 
In fact, I would make this challenge to the press. I would make this challenge to the press of every one of the 50 States. I would ask, if the press really wants to do their job, to do this: Call each of the Senators. All it requires is for the press in each State to call up only two people immediately after the vote on S. 495, and say, `Did you read this bill that you just voted on? Did you understand what was in this bill you just voted on? Could you explain this bill to me that you just voted on?' And if somebody says they voted for a major issue like this, then I think it is reasonable to ask, `Did you read it? Did you understand it? Do you know what is in it?' 
There may be some very good things in the bill. I have heard that it borrows much from the administration's proposals for implementation legislation. I understand that there are some aspects of it that are very similar to legislation that I introduced. And that may very well be so. There may well be some parts of this bill that I would eagerly support and vote for. But the fact of the matter is I do not know and am not being given an opportunity to find out, let alone have hearings or an opportunity to seek to improve the bill. 
We have not had an opportunity or the benefit of discussion. We have not had the opportunity or the benefit of debate--and we will not have debate on it today. 
The sole reason it is up here under this expedited procedure is to give some kind of cover one way or the other to bring up the chemical weapons treaty. What we have is the majority insisting that we consider, without review, a revised substitute version of a bill that was not made available to us until this afternoon. 
Nobody has said in the Senate Judiciary Committee this could not have a prompt hearing. Certainly I would support the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, if he wanted to have a prompt hearing on it. 
The principal sponsor of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, would certainly pursue it strongly through the committee, and I have no doubts that he would be able to explain it very, very well in the committee and answer any questions that might come up. He is a diligent and hard-working Senator who would be able to do that. But under this procedure, we will never know. This committee has a majority of Republicans, as all Senate committees do, but yet the committee will never vote on it. 
The majority leader, who is my good friend, has always described himself as one who seeks regular order. I think the Washington Post had a front-page story on December 3, 1996, in which they quote the Senator describing himself as an `order' kind of guy. 
I recall when our distinguished majority leader came to the floor and said:  
There is a way to do things around here. You bring up a bill reported by a committee, have debate, offer amendments, you vote, and win or lose, and you move on, and then it goes to conference. 
Well, we are not bringing up a bill reported by a committee. We are really not going to have debate. We are not going to offer amendments. We will vote. And that is about the only reflection of order. 
If we were considering a resolution to commend the cherry blossom princess or to say we will open the doors of the Senate 5 minutes early or something like that, I could understand. Instead, we are talking about a 70-page bill which is to provide criminal and civil penalties for acquisition, transfer, or use of any chemical weapon or biological weapon, to reduce the threats of acts of terrorism, armed aggression, and so on. This bill refers to patent law, to chemical and biological weapons, to aircraft, and to continuation and enhancements of multilateral control regimes. It refers to the Australia group--I would like to have five Senators stand up and tell me what the Australia group is, to the Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding and the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement. These are major things. Vaccine production and stocks, decontamination of infrastructure are also serious matters and we have not had any hearing, any debate, any discussion of it. The bill refers to owner or possessor liability and warrantless seizures and seizures on warrants and reimbursement of costs, saying how people will have to pay the United States certain amounts of money under certain circumstances and all. This may be heady stuff, Mr. President, very heady stuff. 
Now, we have had the Chemical Weapons Convention before us since November 1993. It has been bottled up in committee. We have the April 28, 1997, deadline approaching after which our lack of ratification risks economic sanctions against our chemical industry. This could cost U.S. chemical companies hundreds of millions of dollars. We are talking about thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars on something that has been stalled, stalled for years. 
Now but all of a sudden, whoop-de-do, we have a bill and a substitute bill and the Senate is to take 12 minutes and go ahead with it. 
I am afraid that without proper review of the domestic law changes in criminal laws against chemical and biological weapons, 
we may inadvertently weaken protections already in the law. I know my friend from Arizona does not intend to weaken our laws, but that could be the effect of this bill. 
There is no need for this irregular procedure. We ought to be able to take a look at S. 495. I would have no objection to its coming up in regular order after hearings, but it is not a substitute for the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is not a substitute or alternative to implementing legislation. 
After we delayed something that President Reagan had negotiated, something that President Bush had negotiated, something that President Clinton had negotiated, the Chemical Weapons Convention, after we delayed it for year after year after year, now we are going to take up in less than 3 hours and pass this 70-page bill that nobody has read. We delay something that has been debated, argued, considered, we delay that for years, but then we take a major piece of legislation that nobody has seen and do not even debate it and it is out the door. Something has gone wrong here. 
On April 15, every American had to file their taxes or the IRS comes after them. That is the law. We also have a law that says that the House and the Senate shall pass a budget by April 15. With all due respect to my friends on the Republican side, they control the Speaker of the House, they control the majority in the House, they control the majority leader and a majority in the Senate, but we have not had one second of debate on a budget resolution even though the law requires them to pass it by April 15. 
April 15 comes and goes. Can you imagine, Mr. President, if you took that same attitude in filing your taxes and said well, you know, I am busy, I cannot do it. You would hear the doorbell ring and there would be the IRS after you. But nobody comes after us for doing the same thing. 
We have nearly 100 vacancies on the Federal bench, and we cannot get a quorum in the Judiciary Committee to report them out. 
Yet this 70-page major piece of legislation suddenly comes zipping forth. There are a lot of problems in it. As I said, there may be some things I like. But it says, for example, the bill would prohibit the production of 16 specific chemicals and 54 more already controlled by the Australia group. Do we know what chemicals are in this bill that would be criminalized? I doubt that any one of us could even pronounce the chemicals. We do not know what we are voting to ban? 
The bill prohibits any other chemical that may be developed that produces the same effect as the other listed chemicals. I take it this means chemicals developed in the future. But what about other terrible weapons that now exist? Would chemical weapons that exist now but not listed in the bill be OK? What deadly chemicals that are prohibited under current law, which has a far broader definition of chemical weapons, would be freed from criminal penalties? 
We have had no answer. This bill repeals the two major chapters of the Federal Criminal Code dealing with biological weapons and with chemical weapons. The ink is barely dry on the chemical weapons law that this legislation would repeal. The chemical weapons statute became law as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. It was enacted April 14, 1996. It is barely 1 year old and we are going to repeal it without a single hearing, single expert comment about what might be wrong with a bill that we passed a year ago. Do we replace it with a stronger law? No. 
First, the definition of chemical weapons that will be banned under this bill is far more limited than the chemical weapons banned under current law. 
The bill has a number of exemptions to the overall prohibitions on chemical and biological weapons that are far broader in scope than what are in current law. For example, current law bars chemical weapons for anything but lawful authority. This bill replaces that limited, circumscribed rule 
with five extensive exemptions including for any peaceful purpose related to any activity. 
What does that mean? Is that an exemption any enterprising terrorist or criminal caught with a chemical weapon could use to great advantage? Someone could make a strong argument that way. 
While there are parts of the bill I may well like, there are a lot of other parts that raise unanswered questions. Again, any Senator who votes for this, I would challenge the press in his or her State to ask: You voted for it, do you know what was in it? Did you read the bill? Did you understand the bill? Were all your questions answered? Did you feel you repealed any criminal laws we now have that we should have kept? 
Mr. President, we spent far, far, far more time this week in quorum calls when we did nothing than we have on hearings on this bill. We spent more time voting on a 100-to-0 resolution on assisted suicide to make us all feel good. We spent far more time on that than we have hearings on this bill. Mr. President, we spent more time with the Chaplain's prayer this morning than we spent on hearings on this 70-page bill. We spent more time saying good morning to each other this morning than we have had in hearings on this 70-page bill. It takes more time for the elevator to go from the second floor to the first than we have had in hearings on this 70-page bill. 
I do not fault the Senator from Arizona for this. The leadership is willing to bring it forward, and if it is his legislation, then he is obviously going to go for it. 
But before the Senate becomes irrelevant, if we do not have time and will not even follow the law, which requires us to have a budget by April 15, if we only had time to confirm two Federal judges in 4 months and we have a 100-judge vacancy, if we do not have time to have 18 seconds of debate on the budget, if we can bottle up the chemical weapons treaty for years, following the support of President Reagan, President Bush and President Clinton, why in Heaven's name do we suddenly have to come rushing forth with something we do not need now and we do not have to have now? 
If we are going to have an expedited process, I think the emergency should be the leadership bringing forward the budget that the law requires. If we have urgency for something, fill some of those judgeships. After all, the Chief Justice has said that is a judicial crisis. If we have urgency for something, let us take something that has actually had a hearing. 
So with all due respect to the sponsors of this bill and knowing there are parts of the bill as I have read them that I like, there are a lot of other parts that raise far more questions than are answered in my mind. I will oppose it. I would find extremely interesting the explanations of those who vote for it. 
I see the distinguished sponsor of the bill, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the opposition will soon be led by the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. I guess I will yield my time to him. I will speak 1 more minute until he arrives, and then I will yield the floor. 
I understand what my friend from Arizona says about wanting to vote for it now, but we do not need S. 495 now. The clock is ticking on the chemical weapons treaty. It was ticking on it last year, the year before, and the year before that. It ticks right up until midnight April 28. If there is anything we have to vote on and should vote on as responsible Senators, either vote up or down, it is the chemical weapons treaty. S. 495 can wait for the normal hearing route. 
When you have the merger of current chemical and biological weapons chapters in the criminal code but with different definitions and different exemptions for lawful conduct, this is a matter we ought to at least debate. 
Again, I urge everybody to ask and whether members can look their constituents in the eye and say in this 70-page major piece of legislation on chemical weapons, can they say they read it, they understood it, and they are prepared to vote on it? 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just had reason to go and check the Record on something and realized a change had been made in the Office of the Official Reporters of Debates. In the 22 years I have been here, it has been right off the floor, which is the logical place for that office to be. 
I guess I am sort of a traditionalist. I believe that traditions that work should take precedence over perks that some may want. Frankly, I have no idea who made this decision to do all these changes. I do not think it is a good one. As a Senator who prefers tradition over perks, I wish things would go back to the way they were. Sometimes we should realize as Senators, we are only here temporarily. The Senate outlasts us. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Congress we passed legislation I had written to provide criminal penalties for unauthorized snooping in computers. I understand that the Republican leadership is bringing up an extension of that legislation today. I am happy to see them bring it up, but I also point out to the American people that we have already passed some very strong legislation on this. 
In fact, in terms of privacy protection legislation, we could have passed additional, strong legislation last year to provide protection and criminal sanctions against misuse of personal medical information, except that the Republican leadership objected to it. That medical records confidentiality legislation was we put together in a bipartisan fashion with Senator Bennett of Utah, myself, and others, based on work a number of us have been doing for years, but we were blocked when it was going to pass last year. I hope that the Republican leadership willingness to extend protections against government snooping into private financial records will signal a new attitude and willingness to address the crisis that is looming with respect to the confidentiality of health care information, as well. 
I think we have to ask, why is it suddenly so important to take up this IRS bill today without consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee or any Senate Committee. Aha, what is today? April 15. This is, as more and more things around here are, a staged event for partisan political purposes. This is tax day, to be sure. But, unfortunately, the Republican majority is looking for something to do and something to distract from the fact that it is not doing what it is supposed to do today. 
Along with all Americans we have to file our income taxes today, April 15. The Republican leadership of the House and Senate, however, is supposed to pass a budget by April 15. I suspect that there are tens of millions of Americans who are getting their taxes filed by today. When they go down to file their taxes, having stayed up late and worked it out, they should ask the leadership in the House and Senate if that Republican leadership has done what the law requires them to do--to have a budget by April 15. Guess what? Has one been passed? No. Has one even been debated? No. There is a law that says that, by April 15, we must pass it, but today will come and go and the Senate will miss its statutory deadline. 
Now, I ask my friends throughout this country, Republican, Democrat, and Independent, if you don't follow the law that says you have to file and pay your taxes by April 15, what is going to happen? Aha, you might suddenly become a guest of the State, in a very secure place--bars on the windows, bars on the doors. 
What happens to the leadership of the House and the Senate if they don't obey the law and have a budget passed by April 15? They will be on the floor in the House and the Senate with a distraction. 
So while I support the extension of the law we introduced in 1995 and passed last year in order to cover the paper records of the IRS, I remain concerned that the Senate is not making the progress that we need to make on the Federal budget, on the chemical weapons treaty, and on confirming Federal judges. We have confirmed two Federal judges in 4 months. There are 100 vacancies. Talk about zero population growth. At this rate, at the end of the Congress there will 150 vacancies. 
Then there's campaign finance reform. Remember campaign finance reform? Has anybody heard of it since the handshake in New Hampshire. Ha, ha and ho, ho. The Republican leadership could bring up campaign finance reform this afternoon if they wanted to. You are not going to see it. 
I understand that the House plans to use the Constitution as a political prop again today. I guess I should at least be grateful that the Senate has avoided that temptation--for today. 
All I suggest, Mr. President, is that the American people are required to follow the law and file their taxes today. The U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives are required to have a budget by today--and we are waiting. 
Privacy is a precious right of every American. When our own Government workers abuse their access to personal information and compromise our privacy, it is doubly wrong. 
While I was happy that we are taking this matter up today and to support it, I comment briefly on the manner in which this matter is proceeding. Unfortunately, the Senate of the United States is not doing the work that needs to be done to serve the interests of the American people. We are not confirming the Federal judges that we all need, we are not making progress on balancing the budget, we are not considering the chemical weapons treaty, and we are not considering campaign finance reform legislation. 
I commend Senator Glenn for his efforts in following up on his longstanding efforts to monitor abuse of access to Internal Revenue returns and information by Government employees. 
When we file our tax returns today and the American people reveal to the Government intimate details about their personal finances, we rightfully expect that the Internal Revenue Service and its employees will treat that information with confidentiality, as the law has long contemplated. Reports that IRS employees are snooping through these files to satisfy their own voyeuristic urges are unacceptable. Unauthorized browsing by IRS employees has been a longstanding problem, according to a recent GAO report, and one that has concerned a number of us for years. 
It is one of the principal circumstances that motivated me to include within legislation that I authored last Congress criminal sanctions against unauthorized snooping. Back in June 1995, I introduced, with Senators Kyl and Grassley, legislation making snooping through use of Government computers a crime. We obtained the views of the Attorney General, the FBI Director, the Secret Service and others. The bill was considered and reported twice by the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed by the Senate as part of a legislative package back in October 1996. The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act, title II of Public Law 104-294, made it a Federal crime for Government employees to misuse their computer access to obtain private information in Government files. Under the law, Government employees who abuse their computer privileges to snoop through personal information about Americans, including tax information, are subject to criminal penalties. 
Part of our purpose in passing that law was to stop the snooping by IRS employees of private taxpayer tax returns. In 1994, at least 1,300 IRS employees were internally investigated for using Government computers to browse through the tax returns of friends, relatives, and neighbors. At a 1995 oversight hearing of the Department of Justice, I asked the Attorney General whether a criminal statute making it clear that such snooping is illegal would send a clear signal that we want our private information provided to the Government to remain private? Her response focused on the need for passage of the NII Protection Act. 
Attorney General Reno stated:  
Enactment of a new statute covering such situations is advisable to send a clear signal about the privacy of such sensitive information. To that end, included as part of [the NII Protection Act] is an amendment to 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2) that would make it clearly illegal for a government employee to intentionally exceed authorized access to a government computer and obtain information. 
I have long been concerned with maintaining the privacy of our personal information. Doing so in this age of computer networks is not always easy but is increasingly important. 
By passing the NII Protection Act we have already closed a loophole that had existed in our laws. That loophole resulted in the dismissal of criminal charges earlier this year against an IRS employee who went snooping through the tax returns of individuals involved in a Presidential campaign, a prosecutor who was investigating a family member, a police officer and various social acquaintances. He made these unauthorized searches in 1992, before our new law went into effect. He was able to retrieve on his computer screen all the taxpayer information stored in the IRS main data base in Martinsburg, WV. Since the IRS employee did not disclose the information to anyone else and did not use it for nefarious purposes, the wire and computer fraud charges against him had to be dismissed. The point is that with President Clinton having signed the NII Protection Act into law last October 11, the law has been corrected to make such unauthorized snooping through individual tax records by means of computers a Federal crime. 
Employees of the IRS and other Government agencies and departments are forewarned that under the law and augmented by the NII Protection Act last year, unauthorized browsing through computerized tax filings is criminal and will be prosecuted. 
I am hopeful that the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act and its privacy protections will help deter illegal browsing by IRS employees and help restore the confidence of American taxpayers that the private financial information we are obliged to give the Government will remain private. 
Our job is not done, however. We need to remain vigilant to protect the privacy of our intimate personal information in this era of computer networks. I am particularly concerned that we are doing a woefully inadequate job at protecting the privacy of our medical information. For several years I have worked on legislation to provide privacy protection to our health care information. I hope that this year we will finally enact this much-needed and overdue legislation. If we do not, we risk having the computerized transmissions of health care information required by the so-called administrative simplification provisions of the law passed last year, without the privacy protection that the American people expect and deserve.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the whole purpose of the independent counsel law--to get politics out of the process of investigating politically potent matters--has been severely undercut recently by partisan efforts to bully the Attorney General into appointing an independent counsel to investigate fundraising activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign. In fact, some Republicans in Congress have threatened that if Janet Reno refuses to do what they want, she will be investigated and her job will be at stake. 
This marks a new low in the politicization of the independent counsel process. These threats demean our system of justice and, I fear, undermines public confidence in all branches of government. 
Continued politicization of the independent counsel process will be the death knell for this law. The American people already have legitimate questions about how much independent counsels cost, how long they take, and how this law is working. By last count, independent counsels have cost taxpayers a total of over $125 million. Whitewater counsel Ken Starr alone has already spent over $22 million. We still have an independent counsel investigating matters from the Reagan administration. 
Suspicions about the role of partisan politics in the selection of so-called independent counsels are already strong. A Reagan-appointed Chief Justice, who served in the Nixon administration, appointed a staunchly Republican judge to the selection panel that, after meeting in secret, appointed partisan Republican Kenneth Starr to investigate Whitewater. 
If the results of independent counsel investigations cannot be trusted because they are tainted by partisan politics, we will not be able to justify the costs of this law. 
That is why I am commending Senator Durbin for his work on this bill. It takes important steps to begin restoring public confidence in the process by which independent counsels are selected. Specifically, the bill sets term limits for the three judges who serve on the Special Division of the D.C. Circuit division that appoints the independent counsel. Under current law, these judges serve for 2-year terms. However, all of them are on at least their second 2-year term. The legislation would prohibit a judge, including the current panel, from serving more than 2-year terms. 
In addition, the bill would allow sunshine on the selection of independent counsels and the results of independent counsel investigations. What criteria does the Special Division use to select independent counsels? Do they look for trial experience, prosecutorial experience or political experience? The bill places the Special Division that selects independent counsels under the authority of the Circuit Judicial Council and requires that the Council promulgate within 6 months rules of practice for the Division. These rules would specify the procedure for selection of an independent counsel. This is important so everyone will know what qualifications the Special Division uses to evaluate candidates. Public procedures should also open up the process so that appropriate candidates know how to apply for independent counsel positions when openings occur. This is too important a process to be decided by political cronies over lunch. 
The bill would also require that the Court catalog and preserve independent counsel reports and make public versions available upon request. 
This bill is not a cure-all for the problems we have seen with the independent counsel law. But this is a good start. 
Mr. President, the whole purpose of the independent counsel law--to get politics out of the process of investigating politically potent matters--has been severely undercut recently by partisan efforts to bully the Attorney General into appointing an independent counsel to investigate fundraising activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign. In statement after statement by otherwise responsible Members of Congress, they tell her how she should use here discretion and how she should make up her mind, before she even has an opportunity to do so. Some Republicans in Congress have threatened that if Janet Reno refuses to do what they want, she will be investigated and her job will be at stake. 
Basically, the American people were asked last night to make this choice: Would they let the Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, determine what the ethics rules should be, or would they rather allow the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno to follow the law and investigate whether crimes have occurred? 
Frankly, I am very confident in allowing Attorney General Reno to proceed. She has done a pretty darn good job so far. She calls them as she sees them and has been a very straightforward Attorney General. 
I hope that everybody, whether in this body or the other body, will stop trying to substitute their ethical standards and political judgment as to what should be done and allow the Attorney General, who sticks to a very strong ethical standard, to follow and enforce the law. I believe the statements seeking to intimidate the Attorney General mark a new low in the politicization of the independent counsel process.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 6 years ago, thanks to the leadership of Senators Moynihan and C0hafee, this Nation made a fundamental change in the way that it allocates public investment in transportation. That change was based on the premises that local people understand local needs, that funding should be flexible, and that transportation should contribute to meeting national environmental and public health goals. 
I made a commitment to myself and to Vermonters that I would only sponsor legislation that embodies those three premises. Today I announce that I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997, and I look forward to doing whatever I can to ensure that this progressive legislation makes it through the Senate and into law. 
This bill maintains and enhances our transportation commitments in ways that will benefit Vermonters. I fought hard to include the provision that will allow the State of Vermont the flexibility to use Federal funds for Amtrak service. Our small State has two successful Amtrak trains, both of which operate because of the leadership shown by Governor Dean and the legislature. If this provision passes it will mean that Amtrak service in Vermont can be maintained and possibly even expanded. 
This bill also protects transportation flexibility that has been so popular in Vermont. It maintains the recreational trails and scenic byways programs, and allows States to continue to use funds for bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways. I will continue to fight for these programs in the coming months. 
Finally, this bill will bring more resources to Vermont. Out small State lies on a major north-south truck route. Much of this traffic passes through Vermont without stopping for fuel. Consequently, our roads get a lot of the wear and tear that goes along with commerce, without the accompanying gas tax receipts. This legislation provides Vermont with a major boost in highway funding, so that we can better maintain and repair our existing roads. 
In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who have not yet done so to join me and the bipartisan group of 32 other Senators who have committed themselves to the ISTEA reauthorization bill of 1997.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are now in April and we have been in session for 4 months. We have confirmed two Federal judges in 4 months. That is half a Federal judge a month. There are almost 100 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. That means that puts a strain on our Federal justice system. Cases cannot be heard because judges are not there. Prosecutors are forced to plea bargain in cases they do not want to. If you are a private litigant in a business or just an individual and you have suits you want heard, they cannot be heard. 
The Chief Justice of the United States has said it is a crisis situation. It is. 
Mr. President, I urge the leadership of this body to start moving forward and get some of the vacancies filled, take the judges that have already been nominated, get them confirmed, and show respect to the independent Federal judiciary of this country. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Gregg and Senators Jeffords, Snowe, Collins, Moynihan and Smith in introducing the Northern Forest Stewardship Act of 1997 and the Family Forestland Preservation Tax Act. I am proud that this legislation has the entire support of the Senate delegations from the Northern Forest States of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, as well as Senators from other parts of the region. 
Today's legislation is about empowering communities within the 26-million-acre Northern Forest--the largest contiguous forest east of the Mississippi River. This great natural resource criss crosses New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. But as we near the end of the 20th century, growth pressures on the Northern Forest have increased. The thousands of people who live in this region have wrestled with how to maintain economies that provide jobs while preserving the environment that makes the region such a special place. 
Recognizing the challenge facing these communities, Senator Warren Rudman and I sponsored the Northern Forest Lands Study in 1990. Thousands of people who live in the Northern Forest participated in the study which lasted 4 years. Upon the conclusion of the study, the Northern Forest Lands Council was established to develop specific recommendations to address the issues identified in the study. 
As one might expect, the majority of these recommendations focused on local and State issues. However, some of the ideas proposed by the Northern Forest Lands Council requested changes in Federal law. Today, we are here to move forward the council recommendations that need these modifications. 
Here is an example of what Congress can achieve when it heeds the public's voice. It is founded on extensive research, open discussion, consensus decisions, and visionary problem solving by the people who have a stake in the future of the forest. Legislation rarely embodies such a thorough effort by so diverse a constituency. 
This legislation will reaffirm the council's vision of the Northern Forest as a working landscape of interlocking parts and pieces, reinforcing each other: small and rural communities, industrial forest land, family and individual ownerships, small woodlots, recreation land, public and private conservation land. 
These bills focus on three key goals of the council: fostering stewardship of private land, building knowledge and information on forest resources, and increasing funds available for land conservation. These are goals shared by the people and representatives of the Northern Forest region and provide the foundation for the bipartisan support of this legislation in the House and the Senate. 
This legislation also recognizes the extraordinary resources the 26-million-acre Northern Forest region provides to local communities and visitors alike. The forests within the region are rich in natural resources and values cherished by residents and visitors: timber, fiber, and wood for forest products and energy supporting successful businesses and providing stable jobs for residents; lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams unspoiled by pollution or crowding human development; viable tracts of land for wildlife habitat and recreational use, and protected areas to help preserve the biological integrity of the region. 
Given the nature of the council's recommendations, one piece of legislation to implement all the recommendations was not feasible, therefore we are introducing this package of bills. It is our hope that these bills will both be taken up in the appropriate committees of this Congress and will move through Congress as complementary legislation. 
Passing this legislation is a priority for me personally and for Vermont. It will highlight the importance of the forest resources to our region and to the Nation. It will help State, local, and community groups draw upon Federal assistance to work toward the goals of the council. And, it will reaffirm these goals and the shared commitment to protect the environmental and economic heritage of the region. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill on the part of myself, and Senators Gregg, Jeffords, Snowe, Collins, Smith of New Hampshire, Moynihan, Kerry of Massachusetts, and Mr. Kennedy be introduced and appropriately referred.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on March 16, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Senator from New York State, turned 70. Senator Moynihan has been referred to, quite properly, as the intellectual of the Senate and called by many, a renaissance man. I mean no disrespect when I say that during a couple of the gatherings of the Irish on March 17, he was also referred to as the `World's Largest Leprechaun.' 
To me, Senator Moynihan is a good friend and a mentor, a wise voice that I heard before I was in the Senate, and since. He is a man who has spoken with great prescience on issues involving families and the economy, global power and welfare reform, on so many things. 
Senator Moynihan has served in administrations of both Democrat and Republican Presidents. He has always been ahead of his time, sometimes with a controversial voice that then turns out to be the only accurate voice. 
Like all other Senators, I wish him very well as he heads into the latest decade of his life.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night we finally broke through the stall and the Senate confirmed the nomination of Merrick Garland to be a judge on the United States Court of appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. During that extended debate on a nomination that had been delayed too long, I urged the Republican leadership to take up the nomination of Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. 
I am encouraged that those who schedule matters in the Senate have heard our plea and are finally willing to consider this nomination, as well. When we confirm Judge Kollar-Kotelly, we as a Senate will literally double the number of judges we have confirmed this year--from one to two. Unfortunately, there will still be 68 vacancies on the district courts around the country and a record 24 vacancies on the Federal courts of appeals. 
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's nomination was first received from the President in March 1996 and was previously reported to the Senate in September 1996. This nomination was not acted upon before the adjournment of the 104th Congress. She was renominated on the first day of this Congress. her nomination was re-reported again without a single dissent from the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago. During that time there has been an anonymous Republican with an unspecified concern that has prevented this nomination from being considered. In other words, there is an unspecified hold. 
Over the last 5 years, the District Court for the District of Columbia has been at full strength with 15 active judges for only about 6 months. The court has been operating with three vacancies for over a year and another judge is currently absent due to illness. I understand that the vacancies have been contributing to a rise in the backlog of civil and criminal cases pending before the court. 
The criminal case backlog increased by 37 percent in 1996. So much for getting tough on criminals. We are fortunate to have senior judges who were willing and able to pitch in during these vacancy periods. Indeed, senior judges recorded one-third of the total court time spent by all judges in this district from July 1995 to June 1996. In the words of the court's chief judge: `The Court cannot continue to rely on senior judges to bear this much of the caseload.' I agree. 
I thank the majority leader for agreeing to proceed to Senate consideration of Judge Kollar-Kotelly's nomination. And I thank Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee for pressing forward with this important nomination. 
The Senate has not been doing its job when it comes to considering and confirming nominations for judicial vacancies. I asked last night what justified the unconscionable delay in taking up Judge Garland's nomination, what fatal flaw in his character or fairness the Republicans had uncovered? I ask those questions again with respect to this nominee, a hard-working woman who has been serving on the superior court bench here in the District of Columbia for the last 13 years, having been appointed by President Ronald Reagan. The answer is the same: There is no explanation why she was not confirmed before now. She is another of the unlucky victims of the majority's shutdown of the confirmation process last year. 
With respect to this nominee, I note that the ABA Standing Committee unanimously found her well qualified for this position, thereby giving her the ABA's highest rating. She has been an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia since 1984 and has served as the deputy presiding judge of the Criminal Division. 
Before that she was the chief legal counsel at Saint Elizabeths Hospital here in the District. She served as an attorney in the appellate section of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice for almost 3 years. 
She is a distinguished graduate of Catholic University and its Columbus School of Law. She clerked for the Honorable Catherine B. Kelly on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. She has been active in bar associations and on numerous committees of the Superior Court. 
I thank all Senators for confirming this nominee as a judge on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to wish Arnie Aronson a happy belated 86th birthday and to commend him on his many achievements. 
Arnie has been working for civil rights for over 50 years. He began at a time when help wanted ads openly specified `Gentile Only' or `Irish Need Not Apply.' In the early 1940's he organized a coalition of religious, ethnic, civil rights, social welfare and labor organizations into the Chicago Council Against Religious and Racial Discrimination. By 1950 he was working with Roy Wilkins and many others to organize support for President Truman's proposed civil rights effort and engineered the combination of national organizations that created the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. 
He and the Leadership Conference were instrumental in the enactment of the first extensive Federal civil rights laws since Reconstruction, the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, the fundamental Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the pivotal Fair Housing Act of 1968. They have been critical to our civil rights efforts at every turn ever since. 
The Statement of Purpose he drafted for the Leadership Conference says a great deal about this extraordinary man and his dedication to the rights of all: `We are committed to an integrated, democratic, plural society in which every individual is accorded equal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice and in which every group is accorded an equal opportunity to enter fully into the general life of the society with mutual acceptance and regard for difference.' 
Arnie went on to help organize clergy, churches and synagogues. He was a founding member of the National Urban Coalition and a charter member of Common Cause. In the last 10 years, while well in his 70's, he assumed the presidency of the Leadership Conference Education Fund and helped invigorate its educational and public service activities. 
I am proud to call Arnie my friend and to take this opportunity to wish him a happy belated birthday.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the process that has culminated in this amendment has shown that however well-intentioned, the drug certification process is poorly conceived. Mexico is clearly not cooperating in the counternarcotics effort as it should. How can it, when practically the highest ranking Mexican officials responsible for dealing with the problem are profiting from the drug trade themselves? 
But decertifying Mexico would cause more problems than it would solve, by creating resentment with the very people with whom we are seeking to build stronger relations. 
I will vote for the amendment, but I want to stress that I am very disappointed that the administration has not acted more forcefully and visibly to encourage the Mexican Government to deal effectively with the corruption and human rights abuses committed by Mexico's police and armed forces. We should send a strong signal to Mexico that this will no longer be ignored. I would have favored a stronger resolution than this, as I know many others would have, including the resolution's sponsor, but I hope the Mexican Government appreciates the seriousness with which we regard these concerns. 
The reports of rampant corruption among Mexican military and law enforcement officials, and the human rights abuses they have been involved in, are alarming, as are reports of growing paramilitary activity in Mexico. I am concerned that, with United States support, Mexico is blurring the line between its police and armed forces. I am also concerned that our ability to monitor the equipment we provide to Mexico is inadequate. I have urged the administration to be very specific in its agreements for the transfer of equipment to the Mexican police or armed forces, so there is no ambiguity that it is to be used for counternarcotics activities and not counterinsurgency activities. Those agreements should also specify that if members of police or military units that receive our assistance are implicated in abuses, they will be immediately removed and steps taken to bring them to justice. We have done this recently in agreements with Colombian officials, and there is no reason why it could not be done in Mexico. 
The United States and Mexico must work together to combat this problem. But while I and others expect far more from the Mexican Government to deal with corruption and the violence perpetrated by their own agents, unless we curb the demand in our own country, drug abuse will remain a national crisis. 
In the last 10 years, the United States has spent $103 billion on programs here and abroad against drugs. Yet the DEA reports that the amount of cocaine entering the country, as well as the rates of heroin and cocaine abuse among Americans, have remained steady. Again, the evidence is clear. We will not solve this problem until we aggressively deal with the causes of drug use and addiction in our own country. 
Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Dodd, Feinstein, Coverdell, Kerry, McCain, and Hutchison who have worked very hard to reach a compromise on this difficult issue.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to be working with Senator Hatch as original cosponsors of this, the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997. We worked together on this matter last Congress to craft a bill that was reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate by a vote of 15 to 3. 
I raised a number of questions and concerns during our Judiciary Committee hearing on this issue back in September 1995. I spoke of a letter I had received from Prof. Karen Burke Lefevre of Vermont and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She expressed reservations, as a researcher and author, that Congress not extend the term for unpublished works beyond the term set by the 1976 Act. This category of materials is set to have its copyrights expire in 2002. They include anonymous works and unpublished works of interest to scholars. In section 2(c) of the bill we introduce today, we accommodate these interests and preserve the public availability of these materials in 2003, if they remain unpublished on December 31, 2002. 
I want to thank Marybeth Peters, our Register of Copyrights, for supporting this improvement in the bill, and Senator Hatch for working with me on it. 
I am concerned about libraries, educational institutions and nonprofits being able to access materials and provide access in turn for research, archival, preservation and other purposes. We have also made progress in this area as reflected in section 3 of the bill. Copyright industry and library representatives have narrowed their differences. I ask for their continued help in crafting the best balance possible to create public access for noncommercial purposes during the extension period without undercutting the value of copyrights. 
At our hearing I also raised the notion of a new right of termination for works where the period of termination in current law has already passed and the 20-year extension inures to the benefit of a copyright transferee. This bill creates such a right of termination in section 2(d) of the bill. 
At our hearing, I was still considering whether there was sufficient justification for extending the copyright term for an additional 20 years. At that time we were considering the European Union Directive to its member countries to provide copyright protection for a term of life plus 70 years by July 1, 1995. While many of our trading partners had not extended their terms by July 1995, they have acted to do so in the past 2 years. 
I received a letter from Bruce A. Lehman, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, in which he reported that Austria, Germany, Greece, France, Denmark, Belgium, Ireland, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom had complied with the EU Directive on Copyright Term. Sweden, Portugal, Finland and the Netherlands were reported to have legislation to do so pending, as well. With so many of our trading partners moving to the longer term but preparing to recognize American works for only the shorter term, I believe it is time for us to act. 
This bill also now includes a revised version of legislation that passed the House last Congress but was stalled in the Senate to clarify the Copyright Act of 1909 with regard to whether the distribution of phonorecords may be held to be a divesting publication of the copyright in the musical composition embodied therein. The revision is intended to clarify the law while not affecting cases in which parties have litigated or are litigating this issue. 
Finally, I feel strongly that the extension of the copyright term should include public benefit, such as the creation of new works or benefit to public arts. Senator Dodd, Senator Kennedy, and I have been concerned about finding an appropriate way to benefit the public from this extension and continue to do so. Along these lines, the Copyright Office is examining how the extension in this bill will benefit copyright industries, authors and the public. 
Given the changes made to meet the concerns that I raised with an earlier bill and in light of the international developments that are disadvantaging American copyrighted works, I cosponsored the Committee substitute at our Judiciary Committee executive business session last Congress and pressed for its consideration by the Senate. Unfortunately, this bill was not considered by the Senate during the 104th Congress. 
Accordingly, I join with Senator Hatch to reintroduce this copyright term extension legislation this Congress and look forward to working with him to see to its enactment, without further delay.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends, Mr. Hatch, the two Senators from Oklahoma, and Senator Grassley, as an original cosponsor of the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. 
I am glad we are considering and passing this important legislation. 
They are doing this in an expeditious and bipartisan manner. 
Two of the most important rights Congress can safeguard for crime victims are the right to witness the trial of the accused and the right to be heard in connection with the sentencing decision. The Victim Rights Clarification Act is not the first time Congress has addressed these two ideas. In 1990, we passed the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act, providing that crime victims shall have the right to be present in all public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines the testimony by the victim would be materially affected. 
In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Congress included several victims' rights provisions. For instance, we amended rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require Federal judges at the sentencing for crimes of violence or sexual assault to determine if the victim wishes to make a statement. 
Last year, we enacted the Televised Proceedings for Crime Victims Act as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. That responded to the difficulties created for victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. 
Mr. President, I think this is important because so often what we set in the criminal procedures in the Federal court are then adopted by the State courts. During my days as a prosecutor, I felt victims should have complete access to the court during a trial and that victims should be heard upon sentencing. Frankly, I found many times when the person being sentenced had suddenly gotten religion, had suddenly become a model person, usually dressed in a better suit and tie than I wore as a prosecutor and was able to cry copious tears seeking forgiveness and saying how it was all a mistake, sometimes reality came to the courtroom only when the victim would speak. I remember one such victim had very little to say, with heavy scars on her face that would probably never heal. That said more than she might. 
I say that, Mr. President, because in enacting this legislation, we affect not only Federal courts directly, which of course I think is important, but I say to my colleagues in the Senate that after this is experienced in the Federal courts for a couple of years, we are going to find the same procedures followed by State courts all over this country. We saw it in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We see it in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. If they work in the Federal courts, they tend to work in the State courts. 
I am glad to join with my friend from Oklahoma, the distinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma and his colleague, Senator Inhofe, in support of this legislation which shows how responsive Congress can be to victims' rights. 
The Supreme Court has also spoken to whether victim impact statements are permissible in death penalty cases. 
In the 1991 case Payne versus Tennessee, the Supreme Court made clear that a sentencing jury in a capital case may consider victim impact evidence relating to the victim's personal characteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on the victim's family. 
The Court observed that it is an affront to the civilized members of the human race to say that at sentencing in a capital case, a parade of witnesses may praise the background, character, and good deeds of the defendant, but nothing may be said that bears upon the character of, or the harm imposed upon, the victims. 
Unfortunately, the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing case are being categorically excluded from both watching the trial and providing victim impact testimony. Thus the victims are faced with an excruciating dilemma: If they sit outside the courtroom during the trial, they may never learn the details of how the justice system responded to this horrible crime. On the other hand, if they attend the trial, they will never be able to tell the jury the full extent of the suffering the crime has caused to them and to their families. 
I do not believe that current law thrusts this painful choice upon victims in this country. However, recent court rulings reveal the need to clarify and even hone existing law. That is exactly what Congress is doing by passing the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. 
This important legislation will: 
Clarify that a court shall not exclude a victim from witnessing a trial on the basis that the victim may, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, make a statement or present information in relation to the sentence. 
Specify that a court shall not prohibit a victim from making a statement or presenting information in relation to the sentence during the sentencing phase of the proceedings solely because the victim has witnessed the trial. 
Just as importantly, the Victim Rights Clarification Act will not: 
Apply to victims who testify during the guilt phase of a trial. 
Eliminate a judge's discretion to exclude a victim's testimony during the sentencing phase that will unfairly prejudice the jury. Specifically, the legislation allows for a judge to exclude a victim if he or she finds basis--independent of the sole fact that the victim witnessed the trial--that the victim's testimony during the sentencing phase will create unfair prejudice. 
Attempt to strip a defendant of his or her constitutional rights. 
Overturn any final court judgments. 
My cosponsors and I worked together to pass this legislation within a time-frame that could benefit the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing cases. 
Our final legislative product, however, will not only assist the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing case, but crime victims throughout the United States. 
In response to real people, real problems and real pain, Congress has demonstrated its ability to find a real solution--the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance the administration of justice and is not authorized by the independent counsel law. I believe it an inappropriate effort to subvert the independent counsel process. 
We spent 4 days debating this. We have yet to confirm one single judge. We may possibly have a vote on a nominee to one of the almost 100 Federal judge vacancies before we go on our second vacation. We have not had 1 minute of debate on a budget resolution. We have not had 1 minute of debate on the chemical weapons treaty. We have not had 1 minute of debate on the juvenile crime bill. But we spent 4 days on this. 
I would have thought that the day the President leaves for an international summit with the President of Russia would not be an appropriate time for attacking the President. I would have thought it a time for coming together to demonstrate to the rest of the world that Democrats and Republicans can work together and can at least show support for the President of the United States as he pursues the interests of the United States in his meetings with the President of Russia. 
That is the way we have always done it. In my 22 years here, under the majority leadership of Mr. Mansfield, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Baker, Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Dole, we have always, always followed the rule that we do not bring something onto the floor of this Senate attacking the President of the United States as he is about to go into a summit. 
Apparently, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia said, there is a meanness going through this town, and that rule that has always been followed, a bipartisan rule always followed with Democratic and Republican Presidents, always followed with Democratic and Republican leaders, is not going to be followed here today. I think that is unfortunate. I think it gives an unfortunate image to the rest of the world, and it certainly is not in the best traditions of the U.S. Senate. 
It is also ironic that we are being asked to take this action today knowing that last Thursday the Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees sent written requests to the Attorney General invoking the statutory provisions that provide a limited role for Congress in the independent counsel process. 
And, of course, this resolution would call for an independent counsel only for the President--it is restricted to the 1996 Presidential campaign. This resolution carefully crafted so that it won't touch any of the Republicans or Democrats in the Senate or Republicans or Democrats in the House. In other words, we say we are like Caesar's wife, we are above all this, we are untainted by any scandals. But go after the President and the Vice President; and, incidentally, let's really slam the President as he heads off to negotiate with the only other President of a nuclear superpower. I think the resolution takes too narrow a view if we are up to making demands upon the Attorney General for an independent counsel. The resolution shields congressional fundraising practices from investigation. 
Boy, somebody is not reading the paper. It didn't make sense to try to shield us from an investigation when the same limits were proposed in connection with the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee, and it does not make sense or increase our credibility with the public now. 
Indeed, today, the Washington Post had a front page story reporting that a lobbyist for a foreign government was shaken down last summer by the same Member of the House who now chairs their investigation into alleged campaign fundraising abuses. Incidentally, this was not only the lobbyist but, if this article is accurate, it even went to the ambassador of a foreign power. 
We on the Judiciary Committee and in the Congress have done all that the statute allows with respect to the determination by the Attorney General. The 30-day period for the Attorney General's response has begun to run. We do not need to do anything further on this at this time. 
We ought to get about the real business of the U.S. Senate and abandon this ill-conceived effort to instruct the Attorney General how to proceed. She doesn't need our guidance and I do not want to derail the investigations that are under way. 
But if we have to engage in this kind of sideshow, as the President leaves for an international summit, let us at least restrain ourselves from seeking to pressure the head of our Federal law enforcement agency and instead pass the alternative form of resolution that urges her to resist political pressure and follow the law. Incidentally, unlike the original resolution, the alternative resolution, Senate Joint Resolution 23, does not shield the Congress from any investigation. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.  
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the soothing words of my good friend from Mississippi, but they do not bring out the fact the Attorney General has already formed a task force of experienced prosecutors to investigate whether criminal conduct took place in the 1996 Federal election campaigns involving, as well, 30 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation with subpoena power and testimony reportedly being heard before a grand jury. If a preliminary investigation is begun under the statute and an independent counsel is appointed, all this investigation stops, clang, like that. And to say that we are looking at Congress is interesting. If you read Senate Joint Resolution 22, it speaks only of investigating allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 Presidential election campaign. If you look at Senate Joint Resolution 23, which the majority leader wants tabled, it speaks of Members of Congress as well as Presidential elections. It is very clear they do not want it going to the Members of Congress question. 
I still say I am disappointed not to hear why we have broken decades and decades and decades of tradition to bring up something obviously aimed directly at the President of the United States as he leaves for a summit meeting with the President of the only other nuclear superpower. It has never been done, it has never been allowed by majority leaders of either Republicans or Democrats with either Republican or Democratic Presidents. Perhaps at some point in this Congress we will go back to the traditions of comity that we have seen before. But, in the meantime, let us vote on this resolution, but let us also vote on Senate Joint Resolution 23, which would include the Congress. I call on all my colleagues to be courageous enough to speak up and say we will support investigations of ourselves as well as the President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am delighted the Senate is finally considering the nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit. I compliment my good friend, the senior Senator from Utah, for his kind remarks about Mr. Garland. 
Like the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I too believe that Merrick Garland is highly qualified for this appointment and would make an outstanding Federal judge. 
My concern that I have expressed before is that this is the first and only judicial nomination scheduled for consideration in these first 3 months of the 105th Congress. The Senate is about to go on vacation for a couple of weeks. It will be the only judgeship considered, as I understand it. In the past, the Senate has not had to wait the Ides of March for the first judicial confirmation. The Federal judiciary has almost 100 vacancies now and, with the Ides of March, we are getting only one vacancy filled. 
I, too, am sorry we have not proceeded to confirm and schedule the nomination of Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to the district court bench. Here is one nominee we could go with, and we ought to be able to do that today, too. 
The Senate first received Merrick Garland's nomination from the President on September 5, 1995. We are now way into March of 1997. So we have this nomination that has been here since 1995. All but the most cynical say this man is highly qualified, a decent person, a brilliant lawyer, a public servant who will make an outstanding judge, but his nomination sat here from 1995 until today. 
This is a man who has broad bipartisan support. Governor Keating of Oklahoma; Governor Branstad of Iowa; William Coleman, Jr., a former member of a Republican President's Cabinet, former Reagan and Bush administration officials, Robert Mueller, Jay Stephens, Dan Webb, Charles Cooper--all have supported Merrick Garland. So this is not a case of somebody out of the pale. In fact, the Legal Times titled him, `Garland: A Centrist Choice.' I will put those recommendation letters in the Record later on. 
So why, when you have somebody who, in my 22 years here, is one of the most outstanding nominees for the court of appeals, has that person been held up? What fatal flaw in his character has been uncovered? None, there is no fatal flaw. There was not a person who spoke against, credibly spoke against, his qualifications to be a judge, but he was one of the unlucky victims of the Republican shutdown of the confirmation process last year. I liken it to pulling the wings off a fly. This is what happened. 
The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate in 1995--in 1995. But here we are in 1997, and we finally get to vote on it. 
Madam President, we have 100 vacancies on the Federal bench. At this rate, by the end of this Congress, with normal attrition, we will probably have 130 or 140. We had an abysmal record last session dealing with Federal judicial vacancies. 
We ought to show what we have here. Here, Madam President, are the number of judges confirmed during the second Senate session in Presidential election years: 
In 1980, 9 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges. 
In 1984, 10 appeals court judges, 33 district court judges. 
In 1988, 7 Court of Appeals judges, 35 district court judges. 
In 1992--incidentally, 1992, Democrats were in charge with a Republican President--11 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges. 
So what happens when you switch it over, put in a Republican Senate and Democratic President? Do you see the same sense of bipartisanship? Not on your life. 
It is 11 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges with a Republican President and a Democratic Congress. Switch it to a Democratic President and a Republican Congress--zero, nada, zip, goose egg for the court of appeals judges and only 17 for the district court judges. Not too good. 
We have some other charts here. Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke on this. A Chief Justice speaks only in a restrained fashion, when he does. But look what he said. Look at what Chief Justice William Rehnquist said about the pace we have seen in this Senate: 
The number of judicial vacancies can have a profound impact on a court's ability to manage its caseload effectively. Because the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the vacancy rate is beginning to climb . . . It is hoped that the administration and Congress will continue to recognize that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice. 
The administration is sending up judges, but it is like tossing them down into a black hole in space. Nothing comes back out. 
In fact, 25 percent of the current vacancies have persisted for more than 18 months. They are considered a judicial emergency jurisdiction. 
There are 69 current vacancies in our Nation's district courts. Almost one in six district court judgeships is or soon will become vacant. 
I compliment the distinguished majority leader and my good friend from Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in scheduling this one nominee to the Federal Court of Appeals, but there are still 24 current vacancies on the Federal courts of appeals. That number is rising. 
We are way behind the pace of confirming the judges we have seen in our past Congresses. In fact, let us take a look at--I just happen to have a chart on that, Madam President. I know Senators were anxiously hoping I might. 
Number of judges confirmed in past Congresses: 102d Congress, 124; 103d Congress, 129; 104th Congress, 75. So far in the 105th Congress, none. I assume that is going to change later this afternoon when we finally do confirm one judge. But look at this: 102d Congress, 124; 103d Congress, 129 confirmed; 104th Congress, 75 confirmed. The 105th Congress, zippo. 
I think we ought to take a look at this next chart. We have 94 judicial vacancies. Just put the old magnifying glass--I used to be in law enforcement, Madam President. We actually used these things. Of course, we were kind of a small jurisdiction and I am just a small-town lawyer from Vermont. We do the best we can. But the magnifying glass shows zero. I am pleased by the end of this afternoon I can put a `1' in there, and let us hope that maybe we will get some more. Let us hope maybe we will get some more. 
We can joke about it, but it is not a joking matter. We have people with their lives on hold. When the President asks some man or woman to take a Federal courtship, their entire practice is put on hold--it is kind of a good news/bad news situation. The President calls up and says, `I've got good news for you. I'm going to nominate you for the Federal bench. Now I have bad news for you. I'm going to nominate you for the Federal bench.' He or she finds their law practice basically stops on the date of that nomination. They cannot bring on new clients. Their partners give him or her a big party and say, `Please move out of your office,' because they know it is going to take a year or 2 or 3 to get through the confirmation process. 
This is partisanship of an unprecedented nature. I have spoken twice on this floor today on what happens when we forget the normal traditions of the Senate. Traditionally--certainly not in my lifetime--no Democratic majority leader or Republican majority leader of the Senate would bring up a resolution for a vote directly attacking the President of the United States--directly or indirectly attacking the President of the United States--on a 
day when the President is heading off to a summit with other world leaders, especially with the leader of the other nuclear superpower, Russia. Yet, that tradition, which, as I said, has existed my whole lifetime, was broken today. 
The other thing is that no matter which party controls the Senate, no matter what party controls the Presidency, we have always worked together so that the President, having been elected, can, subject to normal--normal--advise and consent, can appoint the judges he wants. And that tradition has been broken. 
If we are going to go against these basic tenets of bipartisanship, then the Senate will not be the conscience of the Nation that it should be. The Senate will suffer. And if the Senate suffers, the country suffers. 
I withhold the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am concerned when I hear attempts to tie Mr. Garland's nomination to the number of judges in the D.C. circuit. Let us remember that Mr. Garland is there to fill the 11th seat on the D.C. circuit, not the 12th seat. Even Judge Silberman, who has argued for abolishing the 12th seat for this court, has testified that `it would be a mistake, a serious mistake, for Congress to reduce down below 11 judges.' That is a verbatim quote from Judge Silberman. 
But we should also remember that when we just put numbers here, numbers do not tell the whole story. The D.C. circuit's docket is by far the most complex and difficult in the Nation. You can have a dozen routine matters in another circuit and one highly complex issue involving the U.S. Government in the D.C. circuit, brought because it is the D.C. circuit, that one would go on and equal the dozen or more anywhere else. 
We can debate later on the size of the D.C. circuit, whether it should be 11 or 12. But we are talking about the 11th seat. And what Senators ought to be talking about is the fact that Merrick Garland is a superb nominee. He has been seen as a superb nominee by Republicans and Democrats alike, by all writers in this field. At a time when some seem to want people who are not qualified, here is a person with qualifications that are among the best I have ever seen. 
So, let us not get too carried away with the debate on what size the court should be. We can have legislation on that. The fact is, we have a judge who is needed, a judge who was nominated, and whose nomination was accepted and voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995. It is now 1997. Let us stop the dillydallying. I suppose, as we are not doing anything else--we do not have any votes on budgets or chemical weapons treaties or any of these other things we can do--I suppose we can spend time on this. We ought to just vote this through, because at the rate we are currently going we are falling further and further behind, and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times, to the detriment of greater numbers of Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. 
Frankly, I fear these delays are going to persist. In fact, the debate on what should be in the courts took an especially ugly turn over the last 2 weeks. Some Republicans have started calling for the impeachment of Federal judges who decide a case in a way they do not like. A Member of the House Republican leadership called for the impeachment of a Federal judge in Texas because he disagreed with his decision in the voting rights case, a decision that, whichever way he went, was going to be appealed by the other side. If he ruled for the plaintiffs, the defendants were going to appeal; if he ruled for the defendants, the plaintiffs would have appealed. But this Member of the other body decided, forget the appeals, he disagrees, so impeach the judge. He is quoted in the Associated Press as saying, `I am instituting the checks and balances. For too long we have let the judiciary branch act on its own, unimpeded and unchallenged, and Congress' duty is to challenge the judicial branch.' 
The suggestion of using impeachment as a way to challenge the independence of the Federal judiciary, an independence of the judiciary that is admired throughout the world, the independence of a judiciary that has been the hallmark of our Constitution and our democracy, the independence of a Federal judiciary that has made it possible for this country to become the wealthiest, most powerful democracy known in history and still remain a democracy--to 
talk of using impeachment to challenge that independence demeans our Constitution, and it certainly demeans the Congress when Members of Congress speak that way. It is also the height of arrogance. It ignores the basic principle of a free and independent judicial branch of Government. We would not have the democracy we have today without that independence. 
I wonder if some have taken time to reread the Constitution. Maybe I give them too much benefit of the doubt. I will ask them to read the Constitution. Article II, section 4, of the Constitution states:  
The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
The Founders of this country did not consider disagreement with a Member of the House of Representatives as an impeachable offense. In fact, the Founders of this country would have laughed that one right out. Can you imagine? I suggested some read the Constitution and, I must admit, in a moment of exasperation, I suggested perhaps some who were making these claims had never read a book at all. But, of course, they have. There is one by Lewis Carroll. It is called Alice in Wonderland. The queen had a couple different points she made. One, of course, if all else failed was, `Off with their heads.' The other is, `The law is what I say the law is.' 
We all lift our hands at the beginning of our term in office and swear allegiance to that Constitution, but all of a sudden there is something found in there that none of us knew about. Impeach a judge because you disagree with a judge's decision? I tried an awful lot of cases before I came here. I was fortunate in that, a chance to try cases at the trial level and the appellate level. Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost, but there was always an appeal. In fact, I found in the cases I won as a prosecutor, the person on the way to jail would invariably file an appeal. I just knew the appeal would be made. That is the way the courts go. 
You do not suddenly say because I won the case, the judge was to be impeached. 
I think back to about 40 years ago and those who wanted to impeach the U.S. Supreme Court. Why? Because they refused to uphold segregation--let's impeach the Court. In fact, I made my first trip here to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, when I was in my late teens. At that time, for the first time, I saw the billboards and demonstrations against the Chief Justice after the landmark Brown versus Board of Education decision. I wondered what was going on. 
In the 1950's, it was not uncommon to see billboards and bumper stickers saying, `Impeach Earl Warren.' These signs were so prevalent, Mr. President, that a young man from Georgia at that time once remarked that his most vivid childhood memory of the Supreme Court was the `Impeach Earl Warren' signs that lined Highway 17 near Savannah. He said: `I didn't understand who this Earl Warren fellow was, but I knew he was in some kind of trouble.' 
That young man from Georgia is now a Supreme Court Justice himself, Justice Clarence Thomas. 
In hindsight, it seems laughable, as in hindsight the current calls of impeachment of current judges will also be laughable. At that time, the call to impeach was popular within a narrow and intolerant group which did not understand how our democracy works or what was its strength. Apparently, it is fashionable in some quarters to sloganeer about impeaching Federal judges again. 
It was wrong in the 1950's to have somebody who wanted to protect the sin and stain of segregation to call for the impeachment of Earl Warren. It is wrong for some today to call for the impeachment of a Federal judge because of a disagreement with a single decision. 
So I hope all of us--all of us--stop acting as though we can go to something way beyond our Constitution because a judge comes out with a decision that we may disagree with. That is not 
a high crime or misdemeanor; it is not an impeachable offense. Maybe it is an appealable question, but not an impeachable offense. 
We in the Congress cannot act as some super court of appeals. Good Lord, we even had a suggestion over the weekend that maybe even the Congress should have the power to vote to override any decision. In fact, it would be a super court of appeals. Good Lord, Mr. President, look at the pace of this Congress. We have almost 100 vacancies on the Federal court and certainly by the end of business yesterday, we had not filled a single one of them. We have not had a minute of debate on the budget. We have done nothing about bringing up campaign finance reform. 
Cooler heads are prevailing. I commend the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, for his remarks on these impeachment threats. He is quoted as saying that impeachment should be based on improper conduct of a judge, not on his or her decisions or appeals. I think that is the way it should be. I think perhaps we should step back before we go down this dark road. 
I understand, Mr. President, that the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland wishes 5 minutes; is that correct?

Mr. LEAHY. In the 104th Congress, I tell my friend from Maryland, there was an unprecedented slowdown in the confirmation of judges to the extent that I think the only year that we could find, certainly in recent memory, where no court of appeals judges were confirmed at all was in the second session of the 104th Congress. The slowdown was so dramatic in the second session of the 104th Congress that it dropped the number down to certainly an unprecedented low, considering the vacancies.

Mr. LEAHY. I absolutely agree. It has been my experience in the past that Republicans and Democrats have worked closely together with both Republican and Democratic Presidents to keep the judiciary out of politics, knowing that all Americans would go to court not asking whether a judge is Republican or Democrat, but asking whether this is a place they will get justice. If we politicize it, they may not be able to answer that question the way they have in the past.

Mr. LEAHY. If my friend from Maryland will yield on that, I will point out the contrast. In 1992 we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate; we confirmed 11 appellate court judges and 55 district court judges. Four years later you have a Democratic President and a Republican Senate and look at the vast difference: zero appellate court judges and only 17 district court judges, notwithstanding an enormous vacancy rate. 
I think what it shows is that, if you want something to demonstrate partisanship, when the Democrats controlled the Senate with a Republican President, they still cooperated to give that Republican President a significant number of judges in the second session, in a Presidential election year, the time it normally slows down, as contrasted to the absolute opposite, the unprecedented opposite, of what happened when you have a Democratic President and a Republican Senate.

Mr. LEAHY. I have a member of the Leahy family to whom I have had the privilege of being married nearly 35 years who hopes time will be yielded back. As her husband, I hope time will be yielded back. I am about to just give the floor back to the Senator from Maryland. I do not know how much more time is going to be taken in opposition to Mr. Garland. I know of very little time that is going to be taken further here. 
So the long way around, to answer my good friend from Rhode Island, I hope time will be yielded back fairly soon.

In 1984, there was a Republican Senate and Republican President, and you see 10 and 33. In 1992, there is a Republican President and Democratic Senate, and the Democratic Senate actually did better for the Republican President than the Republican Senate for the Republican President.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois. His dramatic showing of the difference between the pro se appeals that many courts handle and the complexity of the administrative issues that the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals handles is very instructive for us. Everybody talks about caseloads. Some cases are handled in a matter of minutes. Others take months. They each count for one case. He has demonstrated that in the District of Columbia circuit, because of its unique nature, many of them count for a month. 
Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to hear that nobody wants to delay Merrick Garland. I would only point out that his nomination first came before us in 1995, and he was voted out of committee, I believe unanimously, by Republicans and Democrats alike, in 1995. We are going to vote, I hope, very soon to confirm him. But if that is not delay, I would hate like heck to see what delay would be around here. He was nominated in 1995, got through the committee in 1995 and will finally get confirmed in 1997. 
I understand other members say they would be perfectly willing to help out on the district court; we need help. We have Judge Colleen Killar-Kotelly who is still waiting, nominated very early in 1996, has yet to come through, even though in 1996 alone the criminal case backlog increased by 37 percent. We talk about getting tough on criminals. We certainly will not send the judges that might do it. 
I withhold the remainder of my time.

I also wish to compliment Senators who paid attention to his very, very strong statement at the end of this debate on behalf of Judge Garland. I think that the Senator from Utah and I are committed to trying to move, in a bipartisan fashion, to get these judges here. I hope all Senators will join us in doing that. The Federal judiciary should not be held hostage to partisan, petty, or ideological constraints that really reflect only a minority of views. 
The Federal judiciary is really a blessing in our democracy in the fact that it is so independent. Our Federal judiciary is the envy of all the rest of the world. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I are committed to keeping it that way. We will work together to keep it that way. I thank him for his help on this nomination.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Maj. Gen. Donald Edwards, who has served for the last 16 years as the Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard. Ever since Ethan Allen and his famous Green Mountain Boys took the British fort at Ticonderoga, Vermonters have had a propensity to serve their nation as citizen-soldiers. That tradition is alive and well today, and thanks to Don Edwards, the Vermont National Guard is stronger today than ever before. Don was instrumental in starting the Army National Guard Mountain and Winter Warfare School, which trains soldiers from around the Nation in the rigors of winter warfare. He also excelled at being an advocate of Vermont's interests within the Pentagon. 
I remember the case of the 1-86th artillery battalion, which in 1992 was abruptly threatened with elimination, even though it had one of the highest readiness and retention rates in the entire U.S. Army. It was the kind of short-sighted bureaucratic decision that Don Edwards could not tolerate, and he made a strong case to me. I helped save that battalion, although I had to hold up a defense bill to do it. Don never wavered in his devotion to do what was right for the men and women of the Vermont National Guard. 
Recently, the Vermont Air Guard received four first-place awards at the Air Force's premier air combat competition, known as William Tell. Don always stressed to the soldiers and airmen under his command the importance of training hard and as realistically as possible. 
During Desert Storm, his philosophy paid off, as several Vermont Guard units deployed to Southwest Asia and performed flawlessly during that conflict. Those were anxious times, and Vermonters saw a side of Don Edwards that they had never seen before. He was a tireless advocate for our deployed soldiers, and he acted with great compassion to do whatever he could to help the families of those who were deployed overseas. 
I am sure that some of that attitude was shaped by his own experiences in Vietnam. I know that his tireless devotion to Vermont veterans of all wars has helped Vermonters appreciate the extraordinary sacrifices that were made by ordinary citizens. It seemed like whenever two or three veterans gathered together, Don Edwards was there to lend weight to their cause. 
As Don Edwards hangs up his uniform for the last time, I want to give him my personal thanks for all he has done for Vermont, and to wish him good luck and Godspeed in his future endeavors.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, in introducing tax legislation designed to stimulate the apple industry in the United States. I am pleased that Senators D'Amato and Moynihan are joining me as original cosponsors of the bill. 
Our bill revises the Federal excise tax on fermented apple cider, more commonly known as draft cider, to beer tax rates. As one of the senior members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I believe this small tax change will be of great benefit to cider makers and apple growers across the country. 
Draft cider is one of the oldest categories of alcoholic beverages in North America. Back in colonial times, nearly every innkeeper served draft cider to his or her patrons during the long winter. In fact, through the 19th Century, beer and draft cider sold equally in the United States. 
Recently, draft cider has made a comeback in the United States and around the world. Our tax law, however, unfairly taxes draft cider at a much higher rate than beer despite the two beverages sharing the same alcohol level and consumer market. This tax treatment, I believe, creates an artificial barrier to the growth of draft cider. Our legislation will correct this inequity. 
Present law taxes fermented cider, regardless of its alcohol level, as a wine at a rate of $1.07 per gallon. Our bill would clarify that draft cider containing not more than 7 percent alcohol and marketed in various size containers would be taxed at the beer rate of 22.6 cents per gallon. I believe this tax change would allow draft cider producers to compete fairly with comparable beverage makers. As draft cider grows in popularity, apple growers around the nation should prosper because draft cider is made from culled apples, the least marketable apples. 
The growth of draft cider should convert these least marketable apples, which account for about 20 percent of the entire U.S. apple production, into a high value product, helping our struggling apple growers. Indeed, I have received letters from officials at state agriculture departments from across the nation--Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia--supporting the taxing of draft cider at the beer rate because this change would allow apple farmers in their States to reap the benefits of an expanded culled apple market. 
I have also heard from the Northeast McIntosh Apple Growers Association, the New York Apple Association, the New England Apple Council and many apple farmers, processors and cider producers that support revising the excise tax on draft cider. 
This bill is identical to legislation I introduced with Senators Jeffords, D'Amato and Moynihan in the last Congress. That bill passed the Senate as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, H. R. 3448, but was not included in the conference report on H.R. 3448. I am hopeful that with the leadership of Senators Jeffords, D'Amato and Moynihan, we can enact into law this small tax change that will have a large positive impact on the Nation's apple industry. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the full scope of fundraising irregularities on both sides of the aisle and on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue should be the subject of investigation. 
Today, we have seen reports that a lobbyist for a foreign government was being shaken down and a foreign ambassador was contacted in this regard by the House Member who chairs the committee charged with investigating allegations of fundraising abuses. 
The resolution that many just voted for carefully excludes any attention to congressional conduct. The resolution on which we are now prepared to vote lets the chips fall where they may. It includes congressional election campaign activities. 
Having just voted to instruct the Attorney General to apply for an independent counsel to investigate those with the Presidential campaign, let us proceed to support--not dodge by trying to table--a resolution that would allow the Attorney General to proceed with respect to congressional fundraising abuses, as well. Otherwise, the American people are going to see this as a blatant political attack on the President as he goes to Helsinki that excludes any attention to ourselves.

I am pleased that on April 9 we will welcome another new citizen. Arturo Hale came to the United States from Mexico to attend the University of Minnesota, where he earned a doctorate in chemical engineering. He now works at Bell Laboratories, conducting research on optical fibers. I have had the pleasure of meeting Arturo on a few occasions. He has contributed to our Nation not only as a researcher and taxpayer, but as a caring, involved resident. He has shown that he accepts all the responsibilities of a citizen, and I am proud that he will now have the rights of a citizen as well. 
On behalf of the Senate, I would like to welcome Arturo Hale as a citizen of the United States.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I spoke for hours on this issue on Friday and again yesterday. I will not repeat what I said other than to compliment the distinguished Senator from Michigan and others for what they have said. I put into the Record the editorial from the Washington Post that reaches the same basic conclusion as the resolution of the distinguished Senator from Michigan. 
I spoke of the fact that the resolution before us, the resolution introduced by the distinguished majority leader and others, is aimed just at the President, the Vice President and very, very carefully--very, very carefully--excludes the Republicans in Congress as it does the Democrats in Congress. 
If we want to show real interest in justice, we should say, well, let us look at any activity of Members of Congress, too. Let us not act as though we are so above the law that we can only point our finger at the President. But that is not the point I am here to bring up, Mr. President. 
I have had the privilege of serving with five Presidents: President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton. I have served here with a number of very distinguished majority leaders on my side of the aisle: Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, and Senator Mitchell, all as majority leader; and on the other side of the aisle, Senator Baker and Senator Dole. Of course, now I serve with the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott]. 
I mention these majority leaders, Senators Mansfield, Byrd, Mitchell, Baker and Dole, because there is one thing that I recall from each one of them in setting the agenda of the U.S. Senate. It was that if the President of the United States was going to be abroad in a summit meeting, negotiating with other heads of state, the U.S. Senate would refrain from bringing forward matters directly aimed--especially partisan matters--directly aimed at the President of the United States. 
This resolution is directly aimed at the President of the United States. And what is going to happen? We will arrange to make sure we vote on it almost within hours of the time he will sit down with the President of Russia, the leader of the only other nuclear superpower. 
Mr. President, has this body and this town become so partisan that we are going to ignore the tradition of all Republican leaders and all Democratic leaders in this body, and that is, to show some unity behind the President while he is abroad representing not Democrats, not Republicans, but all Americans? 
Never in my 22 years in the Senate have I seen such an egregious breach of tradition. That does not mean that a President, Republican or Democrat, is given a free ride. What that means is that the President of the United States will at least be able to demonstrate, when he is abroad representing this country, that he is shown some support back home during the time he is abroad. When he is back here, we will go back and forth and fight as we always have. Fine. That is the process. But the tradition has always been to be supportive of the President when he is at a summit with other leaders. Of all summits he might be attending, what could be more important than the one with the President of Russia? 
It was tasteless enough to introduce this resolution and start the debate on it while the President was undergoing surgery at Bethesda. Now, that, at the very least, shows a tastelessness that also, I believe, is unprecedented in this body. That could be chalked up to tasteless partisanship that is not appropriate. It is as bad as making jokes at the President's expense when he is lying there in pain recovering. But we just assume that sometimes we have tastelessness in politics. 
However, when we have votes designed to hit directly at the President while he is abroad in a summit, that, Mr. President, goes beyond tastelessness. That shows no regard for history. That shows no regard for the traditions of this body. That shows no regard for the importance of a President being abroad. 
Now, I had differences with President Reagan on the way the Contra war was run. I recall we held off from any questions of that when he was going abroad for summits. I may have had differences with President Bush and some of his issues, but we held off on any discussion of that when he was going abroad for a summit. 
Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friends on the other side of the aisle--and I have many--I ask them to at least take a few minutes if they are going to set the schedule, and I ask them to take a look at the history of the United States, the history of the Senate, the history of the Presidency, and know there are certain things we do in this country to demonstrate we are worthy of being only 1 of 100 men and women representing a quarter of a billion Americans. 
I am deeply saddened by this. I hope this is only a momentary lapse in the kind of traditions that have kept the Senate, occasionally at least, the conscience of the Nation. I hope this is only a temporary lack of those things that show the Senate to be the best. 
I thank my friend from Wisconsin. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week there was an attempt made, I think, on the part of some--not all, but on the part of some--a serious attempt made in the Judiciary Committee to put together a bipartisan letter to the Attorney General regarding what should be done on the question of an independent counsel and some of the campaign fundraising issues. Unfortunately, it ended up being a partisan matter and the Republican majority, as is their right, sent a highly partisan letter asking immediately for an independent counsel. 
Most of us on the other side sent a letter, which I signed as ranking member, along with other Democratic members, asking basically that we follow the law and we go through the various steps required on the issue of independent counsel: That we do not bring political pressure on the Attorney General to act one way or the other, recognizing that the reason for the independent counsel law was to shield the process and the Attorney General from political pressure or posturing. 
In this regard, I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the lead editorial in yesterday's Washington Post. The Post has been in the forefront of those investigative journalists who have been working on stories about many aspects of fundraising that has been taking place, and is taking place, to finance Federal elections--both fundraising by the Republican Party and by the Democratic Party. Certainly, the Post has not been shy about criticizing Republicans or Democrats, in the Congress or out, with regard to campaign fundraising. 
It is interesting to read their editorial because, basically, they take the same position as we had taken on the Democratic side of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They speak of all the reasons to wait and follow the law itself, as she is now doing, and to have the Attorney General make her own determination. It ends by saying this: 
There is one other major factor that argues for waiting awhile before deciding whether to seek an independent counsel in the campaign finance case. It has to do with what we believe to be the integrity and, if you will, independence of this attorney general herself. She is an uncommon figure in this town, and this administration, as even many who are banging on the table for an independent prosecutor will agree. We do not think it would be an inducement to sleeping well at night to know she was on your case if you had violated the law and were trying to hide it--especially with her honor being publicly challenged over and over again on this matter. 
You balance risks in a decision like this. The risk of leaving the case in her hands at this stage, while Justice Department, congressional and other investigators continue to try to flesh it out, seems pretty slim. Events could change that. But right now the matter seems to us to be proceeding well enough without an independent counsel.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I sometimes think that those who are scheming for an independent counsel for this and an independent counsel for that, counsel that often cost $20 or $30 million of the taxpayers' money, and millions of dollars more of individuals' money, have not bothered to stop and think what they are asking for. It may be good for the evening news and may make a Member of the House or Member of the Senate feel good because his or her name gets in the paper, but does it really help this country? 
In fact, some might ask about this rush to come on the floor Friday, the steady stream of my friends on the Republican side of the aisle who blast the President and tear after the President. I am surprised they did not say, `Why don't we double-check with Bethesda as to what time he will actually be in surgery so maybe we could go on recess or go to our own fundraisers at that time and then come back and make sure he sees just how we are tearing him apart.' 
I suggested half joking on Friday that they would set aside another $1 million that we could appropriate of the taxpayers' money to send a delegation of Members up to Bethesda to make sure, indeed, he was being operated on. It was about that ridiculous. 
I first came to the Senate at a time when Democrats and Republicans showed some respect for whoever was holding the office of President of the United States and had some realization that the person serving as President, like the rest of us, is a human being and an individual. Yet, I have heard Members on this floor pillory the President, pillory his wife, his child, even at times his mother and others, as though somehow they don't have feelings. I have heard things said about him that, if we said them about each other, we could be censured by the Senate--even though some of the things said may be more applicable to some in this body. 
I remember a time, a time when the Democrats were in the majority, since I have been here, when an issue was coming up, for example, about President Ford on personal issues. We held off--maybe he was taking a trip abroad--and we held off on issues. 
The same with President Reagan. Again, when the Democrats were in the majority in the Senate, we would hold off issues of criticism of the President as he was about to leave to go abroad. 
The same with President Bush. 
Yet, here we have the President of the United States, who has just undergone what I have to imagine is extremely painful surgery--the Presiding Officer would be able to understand that better than I because of his own distinguished medical background. I think by all accounts it was a very painful situation. They tell me tearing a tendon is more painful than breaking your leg. I know, from some of my colleagues here who have torn Achilles tendons, or others, have told me that is so. 
Here he is, the President of the United States, undergoing very painful surgery. But notwithstanding the pain he must be in, because of the importance of the relationship between the United States and the world's other major nuclear power, Russia, he is going forward with his summit meeting with President Yeltsin. The President, who is going to be traveling very painfully to Helsinki--whether it is Air Force One or not. I have ridden enough times on Air Force One with various Presidents to know Air Force One can hit turbulence, too, and bounce you all around. It will be a painful trip. 
None of this seems to make any difference. They still proceed on the floor, Friday and today, blasting the President with resolutions and statements. This timing ensures, of course, that all this will be in the world's press, in Helsinki and elsewhere, just in time to be delivered to all those in the Russian party when he arrives. 
Mr. President, I don't know if the Senate is just spinning out of control without any sense of propriety or decorum. Perhaps, at the age of 56, I have become the old-fashioned Member of the Senate. But I have been here for 22 years, and whether it was in my first year as a 34-year-old former prosecutor or now as a 56-year-old senior Member of the Senate, I do know that we have followed a tradition of some propriety in this body. 
We have done that time and time again. We have withheld resolutions, questions or disapproval of a President when he was leaving to go abroad or was abroad so we could at least present a united face to the rest of the world. 
Yet, I have heard Members come on the floor and make highly critical statements of President Clinton when he has been at summit meetings overseas, statements that had to be read by all the people with him from around the world. That, I think, was unseemly. Just as I believe having this resolution at this time at the beginning of the Helsinki summit is highly insulting, shows no sense on the part of the U.S. Senate and, frankly, of those who brought it forward at this time, of the kind of image we should give the rest of the world. 
I am not suggesting by any means that we cannot question the President of the United States. I have done it, other Members have done it, both this President and other Presidents. That is perfectly appropriate under our separation of powers and under our duties as Members of the Senate. 
But I suggest that there are certain times when, by tradition--and a tradition that has served this country very well--that we at least back off and show some unity. One such time, just out of a sense of common decency and perhaps upbringing, would be when the President is in the hospital recuperating from a fairly painful and serious injury. One would think that we would not see this happening in the U.S. Senate. I question what we are coming to. 
But by tradition, by a sense of propriety, and by a sense of Senators putting their country ahead of their political partisan posturing, we have at least held off at the beginning of a foreign trip by a President or at the beginning of a summit. 
Mr. President, I was thinking of this matter this morning as I was coming to work. Comments were made to me over the weekend while I was home in Vermont by a number of people who are not Democrats, who thought that it was unseemly. I have not talked with anyone at the White House about this or anybody in my leadership or anybody in my office. This is simply something I started thinking about. It bothers me that we have reached the point where we are not showing the sense of history in this body that has served the Senate very well in the past, and has also served the country well. 
I urge those who determine the timing of issues before the Senate to take some time during the Senate recess and read a history of the Senate and read a history of the actions of the great leaders of the Senate, Republican and Democrat alike--and we have had great leaders in both parties. Read about the number of times when they have put the United States ahead of their own partisan fortunes, when they have put the United States ahead of their own ability to be in the news, and, frankly, when they realized that the U.S. Senate can be and should be the conscience of the Nation. We should uphold that conscience of the Senate so that the Senate can be the conscience of the Nation. 
With some in this body, it will be a rereading of the history of the Senate. Frankly, Mr. President, one has to assume that for some, it will be a reading of the history of the Senate, and that perhaps in all their efforts to get here, the time-consuming and difficult chore that is, they did not have a chance to read the history of the U.S. Senate before they arrived. But now is as good a time as any. There is going to be a 2-week recess, and that should allow some time to read it. Senators cannot be at fundraisers all of the time during that recess. Read over the history. 
I urge the leaders, those who determine the schedule of this place, that in the future, when the President is about to embark on a major summit, in this case with the other major nuclear power of the world, that they not bring up resolutions designed to embarrass him, designed actually to be voted on the day that he would arrive. As it turns out, it won't be, because he is delayed by a day because of his injury. 
We are not playing school-board politics here. We are not 
some small-town board. This is the U.S. Senate. There are only 100 of us who get the opportunity to serve at any one time, but we represent a quarter of a billion people in the greatest, most powerful democracy history has ever known. I think we all know that. It doesn't matter whether we are Republican, Democrat; conservative, liberal, moderate; no matter what part of this country we are from; we know, instinctively, that we represent the greatest democracy history has shown. 
But instinctively knowing and diligently upholding the responsibility of U.S. Senators to represent that Nation are two different things. If Members want to criticize the President, that is their right. If they want to embark on another investigation, like the rather pointless one the Senate already has, Whitewater--pointless, except for the fact it cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars--fine, they have a right to do that. But at least let's make an effort to present a united face when the President of the United States goes abroad on a major summit. At least give the President of the United States as much backing as possible when he is representing all the United States--not Democrats, not Republicans--all the United States. 
I am reminded of a story my father had told me many times about my State, which for many years was the most Republican State in this country. In fact, after 22 years as a U.S. Senator from Vermont, I am still the only member of my party ever to represent Vermont in the U.S. Senate. In fact, we are the only State in the Union that has only elected one Democratic Senator, and I am it. Sorry about that, Mr. President, but it happens. 
My father told me how the National Life Insurance Co. in the thirties and forties, basically ran the Republican Party in Vermont. They determined every 2 years who was going to be Governor. You had to be very much a Republican. 
In the late thirties--I believe it was 1937--Franklin Roosevelt came to Vermont to look at some flood control projects. He was driving down State Street in Montpelier, past our statehouse and past the National Life Insurance building--they were two separate buildings, although it was sometimes hard to tell which was which--in an open car. My father, the lone Democrat in Montpelier, was standing there, as chance would have it, next to the president of National Life who was then the de facto chairman of the Vermont Republican Party. As the open car went by with Franklin Roosevelt in it, the men all stood at attention and the president of National Life, like all the other men, took his hat off--they all wore hats then--and held it over his heart as President Roosevelt drove by. 
My father could not resist the temptation to chide him a little bit then, and he said, `I can't believe you took your hat off for Franklin Roosevelt.' The president of National Life replied, `Howard, I didn't take my hat off for Franklin Roosevelt. I took my hat off for the President of the United States.' 
What he did was show respect. Respect does not have to be blind. It does not mean we do not question things here. We have great respect on the Democratic side of the aisle for the Republican leadership, just as I would hope they would for the Democratic leadership. But it does not mean we vote with them all the time, by any means. There is a difference. 
We show respect in this body, just following Jefferson's Manual, by the way we address each other. It does not mean we agree. We might be fighting hammer and tong, but we say `my distinguished colleague,' and so on and so forth. 
We should show respect to the President of the United States when he is going abroad to represent every single American. We are the only country left on Earth that still does have the ability to destroy the world overnight with nuclear power. 
Every one of us on this floor, especially every Democrat on this floor, always showed that respect for President Reagan when he was in similar situations, and for President Bush. 
I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts on the floor. He has served here longer than all but a couple of Members. I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is one who would well remember both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate and the House showed some restraint and unity with them. 
This resolution could easily be brought up after the President came back, or any other time. There is absolutely no urgency to bring it up now. But it is brought up on the eve of his trip to Helsinki to have a summit meeting with the President of Russia. 
Mr. President, frankly, in my estimation, this is a new low for the U.S. Senate. In my estimation, this is something I have never seen happen here before. In my estimation, those who determined to bring this resolution up at the beginning of the Helsinki summit ought to be ashamed of themselves. They ought to admit they are ashamed of themselves and put it off for another time. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I said earlier that I have never seen a time in my 22 years here when those who control the majority of the Senate would schedule a resolution of this nature as a President was leaving for a summit meeting--even some of the less significant summits, and certainly not for a summit with the leader of a nation that is, militarily, a nuclear superpower. 
I can think of a number of times when there were issues that were as troublesome to Democrats, who had controlled the majority of the Senate, as this is to Republicans, or as they say it is--so long as it is limited just to investigate the Democratic President and not themselves. There were times when I was here in the majority with Republican Presidents, including President Ford, President Reagan, and President Bush, and time and time again we held off matters that we were thinking of bringing to the floor, even legislation, that might be a matter of some contention while the President was abroad at a summit meeting. At no time would even the most junior member of the Democratic Party, when the Democrats were in the majority, consider bringing up something like this while a Republican President was abroad. 
I think it shows one of the most egregious breakdowns of any bipartisan comity in this body, to see this come up as the President is about to go to Helsinki. I think certainly in my 22 years of experience, it is completely unprecedented. I think it is outrageous. I think it is inexcusable. It does not mean that this whole issue could not be debated when the President came back. It might mean that we would have to delay our 2-week vacation by a couple of days to do it. But we might present a better face to the rest of the world. 
It has become so partisan around here that we look first to partisan advantage and not for the advantage of the country. Some in Congress simply cannot avoid the temptation to jump the gun and demand another costly, time-consuming, largely unaccountable, potentially destructive independent counsel--provided it is only to investigate a Democratic President. Certainly, there is no effort to go and look at any activities of the Republican Party. 
Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance the administration of justice. It was drafted and introduced before the Republican and Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and those of the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to the Attorney General. Those letters are congressional actions contemplated by the independent counsel law. This resolution is not and does not take those actions into account. We have begun a process that will yield the reports from the Attorney General that are allowed by the statute. We ought to give that process a chance to work. 
This resolution, if it was a law, would probably be found unconstitutional. It certainly is not authorized by the independent counsel law. In my view, it is an inappropriate effort to pressure the Attorney General and to prejudge these matters. One of the main reasons this kind of a resolution is not contemplated in the law is to keep political and partisan pressure off the Attorney General. It perverts the independent counsel process. 
The independent counsel law was passed to ensure that 
investigative and prosecutorial decisions are made without regard to political pressures. This resolution would subvert that purpose by subjecting the critical initial decisions about invoking the law to such political pressures. 
It is not Congress' place to determine when to bring criminal charges. This body is ill-suited to that purpose. The administration of justice is ill-served by efforts to intimidate a prosecutor to begin a case. 
The resolution of the distinguished Republican leader will serve only to undermine the investigation that the Attorney General now has underway and will undercut the independent counsel law. It will further erode public confidence in the Government's ability to do its job. 
We ought to do our job up here and let the Attorney General do hers. We are having a hard enough time doing our own job. We have yet to see 1 minute of debate on the budget resolution which has to be passed by mid-April. We have not seen one single judge get confirmed. We have been voting them out of the committee at the rate of three-quarters of a judge a month, and none has come to the floor, not in 6, 7, or 8 months, and there are 100 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. The Chief Justice calls it a crisis. Yet, even though we are paid and elected to do that, to consider and confirm judges, we have not confirmed a single judge. We have not brought up the budget. We have a chemical weapons treaty which is languishing. 
But we can break all precedent and bring up a resolution attacking the President as he leaves on a summit with the President of Russia, the other nuclear superpower, something that has never been done before, something that any Democrat, when we have been in the majority and leading this body, would have been ashamed to do to a Republican President because we know it was so much against the best interests of the United States. Even though it might further our own short-term political gains, we would not want to damage the United States, the President's credibility or the President's ability to represent the United States abroad, so we would not have done it and did not do it. 
There are a lot of issues the Senate could be considering that are within our responsibilities, do reflect our duties in this Government and do reflect what is in the best interests of the country. This is not one of them. It is an affront to the constitutional separation of powers established by the Founders. Investigation and prosecution of crimes is left to those experienced in the use of that awesome power, not matters for a political body. 
When I was a prosecutor, I knew as a prosecutor I had the power to bring or to withhold prosecution. It was not anything I was willing to share with any legislative body. I hoped I would resist that temptation if I were ever a legislator and not a prosecutor. 
It makes as little sense as the call by some in the Republican Party for the Congress to be able to overturn any judicial decision of any Federal court by just a majority vote. This concept would have been laughed down by the Founders of our country. They wanted three independent branches of Government: The executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. Government 101--in most schools, you learn it in the first or second grade. 
What they are now saying, even though part of the strength of our democracy and the protection of our democracy is an independent Federal judiciary, even though we have a Federal judiciary that is the envy of all other countries because of the quality of the men and women in it and their integrity and their independence, 
we now have some who say, `Well, cut out the independence, we will have the Congress stand up and vote to decide whether a decision is right or wrong in a court. We will just overturn it. We will become a super court of appeals.' 
As though we don't have enough to do. We can't bring up a budget. The chemical weapons treaty isn't before us either to be voted up or down. We haven't even found time to vote to confirm 1 single judge when there are 100 vacancies in the Federal courts. But somehow we are going to have time to start reading judicial opinions and decide whether to vote to overturn them? I wonder how many judicial opinions most Members of this body have read since they have been here. I wonder how many are prepared to sit down and read the thousands delivered every year. This is balderdash of the first order. 
Then, yes, the other thing they are going to do, there are now Members in the other body who suggest that if we don't like a decision, impeach the judge. Now, some who were saying that, I will grant you, have read--I have suggested that some don't read enough in this body--but some of those who say `just impeach the judge' when we disagree, they have at least read something. Unfortunately, they read Lewis Carroll's `Alice in Wonderland' and got stuck in the part where the queen says, `Off with their heads.' Every time the queen disagrees with something, `Off with their heads.' 
Well, we are a gentler and kinder nation, so some say, `I disagree, impeach him, impeach him.' My goodness, it sounds like the chipmunk chorus, like we hear in some of the songs at Christmas time. 
This country was made by giants. Let us not have it torn down by pygmies. Let us respect our three branches of Government. Let us respect the independence of our judiciary. Mr. President, I have tried a lot of cases. Some I won; some I lost. But if I lost them and felt the case wrongly decided, I would appeal them. If somebody on the other side lost, they could appeal. That is what you do. I can imagine the hoots if somebody in one of these cases who lost, immediately said that we have to impeach the judge. We have appellate courts--appeal it. What are you going to do if you disagree with the appellate courts? Are you going to impeach them? Suppose they are upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. I can see a delegation of us going right out that door, Mr. President, straight across the street with our torches held high, our pitchforks brandished, our tumbrels `tumbreling'--the reporter of debates will have fun with that one--saying, `We are here to impeach the Supreme Court, you naughty boys and girls. You voted differently than we think you should have.' 
You know, I was reminded today of the first time that I saw a billboard to impeach the Supreme Court was when I was 18. I made my first trip down here. Some were upset that the Supreme Court didn't want to uphold segregation, so `impeach the Supreme Court' was their slogan. How laughable, in hindsight. How acceptable is the repeal of our segregation laws today. How laughable, in retrospect, were those billboards of that time. But at the time they were popular with a group. They were popular with a segment of the political society, and so that was why the billboards were there. 
Well, I have no question in my mind that it may be popular today for some to say `impeach judges' when we disagree with them--but not for the high crimes and misdemeanors the Constitution speaks of, not for the only ground the Constitution allows for impeachment, but simply because we disagree with their decision. It may be popular with some. 
In retrospect, it will be seen as laughable. 
But at the moment it is dangerous. It is dangerous, Mr. President, because a democracy exists only if we have respect for the institutions of a democracy. A democracy exists only if we follow our traditions and our laws and our best instincts. This does none of that. It doesn't follow tradition, and it doesn't follow any laws or our best instincts. Most importantly, it does 
not follow the Constitution, the remarkable instrument that has maintained this Nation for over 200 years. It has turned us into the most respected, most powerful democracy known to history. 
I urge all Senators, all House Members, all of us who have the responsibility, who have taken the oath to uphold the Constitution, to step back a moment, stop the foolishness of these calls for impeachment, stop the irresponsibility of refusing to fill judicial vacancies, stop the attacks on the President as he moves from his hospital bed to one of the most important summits he will have of his Presidency. 
This does not mean we cannot criticize. Everybody is free to vote for or against any proposal of the President. Any one of us is free to vote for or against any amendment of mine or anybody else's. 
But what we are not free to do is, for short-term political gain, is tear down the best things that make this country run. We are not free to tear down the Constitution on issues of judicial appointments or independence just because it may sound good in a speech back home or to a fundraising group. We are not free to try to design the timing of resolutions to embarrass a President when he is about to go into a major summit. 
Frankly, I will put my money on the President handling that summit with all of the issues involved, from the democracy movements within the former Soviet Union to our own nuclear security. Maybe the President is better off to have some in this body distracted by voting on this, rather than thinking of other things they could do to try to meddle into the foreign policy leadership of the President. 
Mr. President, I suggest that this extreme partisanship--and that is what it is--is something I have never seen in my time in the Senate, and it is time that we back off. It does not help the Senate. If somebody wants to state a selfish reason, it won't help any one of us either. Most importantly, it doesn't help the country. I have always believed that all the men and women in here are true patriots who have, or should have, the interests of the country first and foremost above their own political well-being or the political well-being of any special interest group on the left or the right. 
Maybe they want to back off. Maybe it might be good that some would acknowledge that they picked a poor time to bring this up, that it really does jump the gun. I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt that it might even have been a mistake to bring it up now. I realize the possibility is very, very slim but I will even accept the possibility that it might not even have been brought up with the intention of embarrassing the President. I assume it was. But I will accept even the possibility. 
I ask the same question that so many others have asked me: Why in Heaven's name? What have we come to that we try to send the President to a summit to represent everyone of us but knowing all the headlines will be `Senate Debating Resolution to Investigate the President of the United States?' We know that for some this is being done for short-term political gain for upcoming fundraising or fundraising letters. But the people who read the headlines in the newspapers around the world do not, and certainly those who will be at the summit do not. 
So I think it is a mistake. We ought to get on to other things.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join as an original cosponsor of the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997. 
One of the most important rights that we can safeguard for crime victims is the right to be heard in connection with sentencing decisions for the perpetrators of the crimes that changed their lives. When I was privileged to serve as State's attorney for Chittenden County, I tried to inform crime victims of the status of cases and to involve them, not only as witnesses at trial, but during the sentencing proceedings as well. Lawyers call this a right of allocution. To victims, it is a right to be heard. A similarly important right for victims is the right to witness the trial of the accused. 
Congress has addressed a victims' right of allocution and right to witness trials several times in recent years. In 1990, Congress passed the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act, commonly known as the victims bill of rights. This legislation expressly provides that crime victims shall have the right to be present at all public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial. 
In the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Congress included several provisions granting victims the right of attendance at trials and allocution in sentencing hearings. For instance, the legislation provides for a specific right of allocution by amending rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, thereby requiring Federal judges at the sentencing for a crime of violence or sexual assault to address the victim personally if the victim is present at sentencing and to determine if the victim wishes to make a statement or presentation. The legislation also authorizes courts to hear victim impact testimony at capital sentencing proceedings, and requires courts to determine if the victim wishes to make a statement or present any information in relation to the sentence. 
Finally, last year, Congress enacted the Televised Proceedings for Crime Victims Act as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Responding to the difficulties created for victims of the Oklahoma City bombing when the trial was moved to Denver, the statute was designed to provide a closed circuit feed back to the victims and their families in Oklahoma City. 
The Supreme Court has also ruled that victim impact statements are permissible in death penalty cases. In the 1991 case Payne versus Tennessee, the Supreme Court said that a sentencing jury in a capital case may consider 
victim impact evidence relating to the victim's personal characteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on the victim's family. The Court made clear that it is an affront to the civilized members of the human race to say that at sentencing in a capital case, a parade of witnesses may praise the background, character, and good deeds of the defendant, but nothing may be said that bears upon the character of, or the harm imposed upon, the victims. 
Although Congress and the Supreme Court has made progress over the last 20 years in recognizing crime victims' rights, we still have more to do, especially with regards to a victim's right of allocation and right to witness trials. Although I spoke of the need to do more with regards to these issues last year when Congress enacted the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, this need was highlighted by the recent district and appellate court rulings on motions in the Oklahoma City bombing cases. The courts ruled that the victims are categorically excluded from both watching the trial and providing victim impact statements. Thus the victims are faced with the excruciating dilemma of having to choose between attending the trial and testifying at the sentencing proceedings. If they sit outside the courtroom during the trial, they may never learn the details of how the justice system responded to this horrible crime. On the other hand, if they attend the trial, they will never be able to tell the jury the full extent of the suffering the crime has caused to them and to their 
families. 
The law as it is, has been written by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court does not thrust this painful choice upon the victims. However, the recent district and appellate court rulings on motions reveal the need to clarify existing law. In this regard, let me specify what the Victims' Rights Clarification Act of 1997 would and would not do. 
The law would: 
Clarify that a court shall not exclude a victim from witnessing a trial on the basis that the victim may, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, make a victim impact statement. 
Clarify that a court shall not prohibit a victim from making a victim impact statement solely because the victim had witnessed the trial. 
Just as importantly, the law would not: 
Eliminate a judge's discretion to exclude a victim's testimony that creates unfair prejudice, confuses the issues, or misleads the jury. 
Attempt to strip a defendant of his or her constitutional rights. 
Overturn any final judicial rulings. 
The defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing case have argued to the court that, despite the victims' rights laws, the court has the responsibility to safeguard against any identifiable risk that emotion could overwhelm reason when the victims provide their victim impact testimony. According to the defendants, the only way that the court can meet this responsibility is to provide the victims with the Hobson's choice of witnessing the trial or providing victim impact statements. However, to paraphrase Justice O'Connor's eloquent statement in the Payne versus Tennessee case, the possibility that evidence may in some cases be unduly inflammatory does not justify a prophylactic, constitutionally based rule that this evidence may never be admitted. 
It is for this reason that I am joining my cosponsors to clarify what rights victims in this country should and do have. There is more that needs to be done in this regard, but with this bipartisan legislation, we are taking an important and timely step in the right direction.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the first comment this morning is that everybody wishes the President well in his upcoming surgery. It is almost like those in some of the terrorist groups that go out and kneecap somebody and then send flowers to them in the hospital. I am not suggesting that there is hypocrisy in it, but I am waiting for all of the requests for special counsel and for some of my friends on the other side to ask for a resolution to spend money to send Senators in surgical gowns out to Bethesda to make sure the President really is out there having an operation. 
It has reached that kind of a level around here. For some of my colleagues, if President Clinton were to walk across the water to save somebody from drowning, the headline in their statement would be, `It proves he can't swim.' 
When I hear some of the statements being made, I am reminded of a what a former Republican President--who, incidentally, was one of the best fundraisers I have ever known--said, `Well, there you go again.' 
Some in the Congress simply cannot avoid the temptation to jump the gun, draw the most negative possible inferences, and take every opportunity to discredit those who serve in the Government, 
and, as one who has served for years in law enforcement, they also take every possibility to discredit those who serve in law enforcement, and demand yet another costly, time-consuming, largely unaccountable and potentially destructive independent counsel investigation so long as it is limited to only investigating a Democratic President. 
Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance the administration of justice. I think it is a kind of partisan effort at political spin. It comes at the end of a week during which the Senate rejected the majority leader's version of a resolution to restrict the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation. That resolution, before it passed, was altered during our floor debate to include examination of improper as well as illegal fundraising activities and finally to include such activities in congressional as well as the Presidential campaign. It then passed 99 to nothing. 
The joint resolution before us is a similarly ill-conceived effort. It was introduced before the Rules Committee or the Senate moved to consider, amend and reamend the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee. It was introduced before the Judiciary Committee met on a committee resolution on March 6. It was introduced before the Republican and Democratic members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees sent letters to the Attorney General. Those letters are the congressional actions contemplated by the independent counsel law. This resolution is not. 
In fact, this resolution, if it were introduced as a bill rather than merely a sense of the Senate resolution and then passed as a law, would not pass constitutional muster. 
It is very, very easy to stand here and say go out and look at the President; do not look at anything we do. Whatever you do, do not look at the House or Senate Members of Congress. But let us go after the President. 
Mr. President, what we are saying is that our regular law enforcement agencies cannot do the job. We in Congress can. That is a laugh. As I said, I spent nearly 9 years in law enforcement. I know that the Attorney General and the others in law enforcement here have the independence to do what needs to be done. But I also know that it is the height of hypocrisy to say look at them; do not look at us. 
The American people, the public, want more than anything else real campaign reform. The Republican leadership of the House and Senate could bring campaign reform measures to the floor today and ask us to have votes on them. Instead, they want to spend days and days and days bashing the President. Even while he is lying in the hospital in Bethesda for surgery, they will spend days bashing him, hoping that nobody will notice the tens of thousands of dollars we will spend in this Chamber in this debate and the printing costs of it all. They are hoping that maybe the American public will not ask the question: If you have all that time and money and effort to spend, why not debate real campaign finance reform and vote on it--campaign finance reform that would apply not just to the President and Vice President but would apply to every Democrat, Republican and Independent in the House and Senate and every Democrat and Republican and every Independent who might challenge an incumbent. 
The fact is that if you took a poll today and asked the American public, do you want real campaign finance reform, the response would be a resounding yes. I hope the America public will ask the Republican leadership of the Senate and the Republican leadership of the House, because they are the ones responsible for setting the legislative agenda, when are you going to bring campaign finance reform to the floor? The President has said he will sign the bill. Unlike the last strong, tough campaign finance reform bill that was passed by the House and Senate and went to the White House for signature and was vetoed by the former President, this President has said he will sign such a bill. 
It is going to be easy during the vacation set up in a week for the House and Senate, for Members to go home and give wonderful speeches and say we are in favor of campaign finance reform. We 
are all in favor, just like we are in favor of God and motherhood. But I hope people ask, but have you voted on it? When are you going to vote on it? Bring it up and have a vote on real campaign finance reform. 
Now, some Members will vote against it and some Members will vote for it. But at least the American public will know how their Member of the House and their Senators voted. That is all we are asking. 
I understand and I have great respect for some Senators who do not want to vote for a campaign finance reform bill, even those who oppose campaign finance reform legislation. I do not question their motives. Let them vote against it. But I also respect those such as Senator Feingold and Senator McCain who have brought forward a campaign finance reform bill, and they ought to have a vote on it. That is all I am asking. Stop the smokescreens of Friday afternoon talks about investigating the President. I am sure they will pause at some point to wish him well during his surgery this afternoon and then they will go right back to bashing him. 
Why not say here, Mr. President, we will actually do what we are hired to do, what we are elected to do, what we are paid to do. We will pass a campaign finance reform law. 
In fact, while we are at it, maybe we ought to pass the chemical weapons treaty. 
While we are at it, maybe we ought to pass a budget. My good friends on the other side of the aisle criticize the President's budget. Well, they have a majority of the votes in the House and Senate to pass their own. In fact, the law requires them to do it shortly after the vacation. Let us see if they will pass one. 
It occurs to me the kind of votes necessary to pass a budget are the kind of votes that might cause some political pain on the right and the left, and maybe that is why we do not actually vote on those kinds of things. It occurs to me that if we passed a bill on campaign finance reform, it would actually cause some pain, especially for those of us who are incumbents, and maybe that is why the leadership will not bring that bill to the floor. It occurs to me that the reason these resolutions about investigations are very carefully aimed at the President and exclude any consideration of possible improper activity on the part of Members of Congress is that maybe--maybe--some who are supporting them want to make sure no gaze of a special prosecutor is directed at activities of Members of Congress. 
There are only 100 people at any one time who are given the opportunity to be in the Senate. I do not question the fact that you have to have some partisan motivations to get elected in the first place. But when you are here and take an oath of office, an oath to uphold the Constitution, to represent the whole country and to uphold the Constitution of the United States, let us not have partisan games that are more reflective of somebody running for some minor county office somewhere. We are supposed to be reflecting the interests of all of the United States. We are supposed to be reflecting the interests of all people. What we do as the Senate should reflect the conscience of the United States. The Senate should be, and at times has been, the conscience of this great country. 
But, when we engage in partisan games aimed at sliming the President, but at the same time protecting every single thing we do, that is not representing the conscience of the United States. That is not rising to the level of what the U.S. Senate should be. 
If Members want to investigate the President on fundraising activities, then be honest enough to say we will apply the same searchlight, the same magnifying glass, the same standards to ourselves. Do not give a hypocritical image of the U.S. Senate to the American people by saying we will go after the President but we will make sure that nobody looks at us, nobody asks us if any of us had done the exact same things we are asking the President not to do. That is not showing the kind of respect we should have for this Senate, for this body, for the precedents we establish here. 
This resolution before us is not authorized by the independent counsel law. If it were a separate bill, it would not pass constitutional muster. It is an inappropriate effort to pressure the Attorney General to prejudge these matters. It would pervert the independent counsel process under the law. The independent counsel law was designed to protect the independence of investigatory and prosecutorial decisions, including those of the Attorney General. This resolution would say that Congress does not want the Attorney General to be independent. The resolution says that we want to step in and tell her what to do and how to do it. The independent counsel law was passed to ensure that investigative and prosecutorial decisions are made without regard to political pressure, but this action by the Senate would subvert that purpose by subjecting the critical initial decisions about invoking the law to just such political pressure. 
We are saying to the Attorney General, do not you use any of your judgment. We will tell you what you have to think. When I was a prosecutor, I know what I would have told any legislative body that told me how to exercise my prosecutorial discretion. It is not Congress' place to determine whether and when to bring criminal charges. As a former prosecutor, I say this body is ill-suited to that purpose. The administration of justice is ill-served by efforts to intimidate a prosecutor to begin a case, just as it would be ill-served by the legislature trying to intimidate a prosecutor to end a case. 
This resolution will serve only to undermine the investigation that the Attorney General now has underway. It will undercut the independent counsel law and I believe it further erodes public confidence in Government's ability to do its job. We ought to do our job and let the Attorney General do hers. 
Part of our job would be to pass campaign finance reform. But you see absolutely no effort by the Republican leadership to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote. Part of our job would be to vote up or down on the chemical weapons treaty, but you see no effort on the part of the Republican leadership to bring that to a vote. Part of our job would be to pass a budget, vote it up or down, but you see no effort on the part of the Republican leadership to bring that to a vote on the floor. What this resolution does is take the Senate down another detour, away from the critical work that we should be doing and is being left undone. 
I have been here 22 years. I have been proud to work with Republicans and Democrats on major legislation. On the floor of the Senate during last year's Presidential election, I took the floor of the Senate to praise the former Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole. I praised him during the height of the Presidential election year, saying he is a man I had worked with closely for bipartisan solutions on farm bills, on hunger issues, on school lunch, school breakfasts, and the Women, Infants, and Children Programs. We forged a bipartisan consensus, just as I have been proud to do with so many other Members on the Republican side, and just as so many real leaders in the Republican Party have done as they have worked with Members of the Democrat side to form a bipartisan consensus on issues that are most important to the United States of America. 
Unfortunately, when you have things like this resolution, 
which are so blatantly partisan, where little effort is made to bring about a bipartisan resolution, we find ourselves going further away from the kind of bipartisan approach to the Nation's problems that we heard so much about when this session was beginning. 
It is almost as though some go out and have a pollster ask, `What do you American people want of us?' They will get back from the pollster that the people want us to work together, they want us to have bipartisan solutions, they want us to show more civility, they want us to work together in the interests of the country. So what do these well-informed legislators proceed to do? They go on the Sunday talk shows and have weekend press conferences and say that it is a new day, that there is an effort for bipartisan consensus. They say what they think the people want to hear. 
But do we see a bipartisan effort on a budget resolution? No. Do we see a bipartisan effort on a chemical weapons treaty? No. Do we see a bipartisan effort to confirm Federal judges? 
There has not been one single judge confirmed yet this Congress. You know, there is a heck of a lot more effort given to somehow influencing the appointment of an independent counsel or special prosecutor, by this body, than there is to considering and confirming Federal judges. Not one single Federal judge has been confirmed by this Congress. Not one court of appeals judge was confirmed in the last session of Congress. The Chief Justice of the United States, a conservative Republican, appointed first by one Republican President as a member of the Supreme Court and subsequently by another Republican President as Chief Justice, has said we have reached a crisis situation. There are nearly 100 vacancies in our Federal courts. Justice is not only delayed, justice is denied to American people--all American people, Republicans and Democrats alike. 
Everybody knows it is a crisis. But this Senate, with all the talk about bipartisanship, has not confirmed one single Federal judge. In fact, I think there is only one scheduled for consideration by the Senate. At this rate--I am 56 years old--through normal attrition and all, if we keep on at this rate, when I am 156, instead of 100 vacancies we will have 300 or 400 vacancies. 
This is not the way to show any kind of bipartisan consensus. If we spend one-tenth as much of an effort at confirming Federal judges that we are supposed to, that we are paid to do, that we are elected to do we might begin to fulfill our responsibilities. If we spend one-tenth the effort on confirming judges that we spend on cranking up more and more multimillion dollar investigations of the President, we might accomplish something. But, obviously, that is not intended in this new era of bipartisanship. 
We spent the first 2 months of this year debating a proposed constitutional amendment that is unnecessary, unsound, and unwise, but a bumper-sticker approach to the problems of budget deficits and the need to balance our Federal budget. We have not spent 38 seconds on this floor actually debating a real budget. We have not spent 21 seconds; we haven't spent a nanosecond. We spent 2 months talking about something that might take effect in the next century. 
But we have not spent 2 seconds debating something that will take effect this year. 
Mr. President, I fear for the Senate. I am proud of the Senate. I am proud of being here for 22 years. I am proud of serving with great Republican leaders and great Democratic leaders. I am proud of serving with men and women from both the Republican and Democratic side whom I consider true national leaders. 
What makes me proud is they have come together for the best interest of the United States, not leaving behind their party allegiances, but being first and foremost Americans and U.S. Senators and doing what is best for the country. I do not see that happening now, Mr. President. It fills this Senator with a great deal of sorrow. 
This is not the way we do things in my State. In my State, we will fight for our elections. Some win, some lose. Then we come together as Republicans and Democrats for what is best for Vermont. We, U.S. Senators, 100 of us having a chance to represent more than 250 million Americans, ought to do what is best for this country. A quarter of a billion Americans expect the 100 men and women of this body to do that, and we are not bringing together the bipartisan consensus we used to and that we need to achieve. 
I talked about the bumper-sticker sloganeering of the constitutional amendment. It failed here. In the House, they have not even had a committee markup. The Republican Party decided not to do that. For whatever their reasons are, I hope now, after spending months on that ill-fated effort, we can actually debate and pass a budget. I tell my friends on the other side of the center aisle that if they really want to work on a bipartisan budget, we can. For that matter, they do not have to ask for a single Democratic vote. There are enough Republicans in the House and Senate to pass a budget, as the law requires, by April 15, if they really want to. 
Mr. President, I have talked about judicial vacancies. Twenty-five percent of the current vacancies have persisted for more than 18 months. A quarter of the judicial vacancies in this country have been there for a year and a half. This is justice delayed, this is justice denied, this is wrong. 
I have served here twice in the majority and twice in the minority. I have served here when the President of the United States was President Gerald Ford, then President Carter, then President Reagan, then President Bush, and now President Clinton. Never in my memory, under Republican Presidents or Democratic Presidents, with Republican Senates or Democratic Senates, never has the leadership of this body ever allowed a situation when judicial vacancies would exist in this number for this long. Never. 
Republican leaders like Howard Baker or Bob Dole or Hugh Scott, Democratic leaders like Mike Mansfield or Bob Byrd or George Mitchell or Tom Daschle never countenanced such a thing. Never would these great leaders have done this. Never have they allowed the Federal judiciary to get in such an abysmal state, when the Chief Justice has to say it is a crisis, when the Chief Justice says: `It is hoped that the Administration and Congress will continue to recognize that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.' And yet, we have to tell him today that we are not doing it, we are not doing our job. 
A little over a year ago, the Republican majority of the House and Senate closed down the whole Government, for days on end, weeks on end, to make a political point. The political point is that they wasted hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money and the American public found out the Speaker of the House, at one point, had to go out the back door of Air Force One--obviously, the kind of affront that they felt justified wasting hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. 
They were making a political point and the Government was closed down. Some say billions of dollars were wasted. It was an enormous inconvenience to the American taxpaying public who were 
wondering what was going on. 
Having had this failed experience of closing down the executive branch of Government, it appears they now want to close down the judicial branch of Government. This is the kind of capricious meanness that you see in a schoolboy plucking the wings off a fly. This is beneath the dignity of the U.S. Senate. This is beneath the dignity of being a U.S. Senator. This is beneath the dignity of our Constitution. This is wrong. This has never been done. It was never done under the leadership of Senator Baker and Senator Dole, under the leadership of Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, or Senator Daschle. I doubt if it was ever done under the leadership of those who came before them. 
The Senate is not fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. It is interfering with the President's authority to appoint Federal judges. It is hampering the third, coequal branch of our Government. 
The Republicans controlling the 104th Congress shut down the executive branch, this Congress they seem intent on shutting down the judicial branch for political gain. It is a scandal in the making. It is high time for the Senate to do its duty to consider and confirm judges to the vacancies that have persisted for so long. 
Instead, they bring to the Senate floor this resolution and say, `Hey, Mr. President, I hope you enjoy your time in Bethesda. Turn on C-SPAN. We're going to stand here and bash you for a day or two or three.' 
I suggest this: If you want to do that--if the leadership figures that the only thing to do, because they cannot pass a budget, cannot ratify a treaty, cannot pass anything else that might significantly improve the lives of the American people--if, instead, they want to use this Senate to bash the President, could we have maybe an hour every day to do the people's business? Maybe an hour a day? For 10 hours, they can bash the President and 1 hour each day we could actually debate their budget resolution, if they had a budget resolution. For 10 hours a day, bash the President, an hour a day actually consider and confirm Federal judges. 
It is getting a little ridiculous. Do people know that we get paid $133,000 a year, and we have not had 1 second of debate on the budget resolution that the Republican leadership of the Senate and the House are supposed to bring before us for a vote? Do they know that we get paid $133,000 a year, but if you want to litigate a case in a Federal court, you probably cannot get before a Federal judge because of the vacancies that our inaction is perpetuating? 
Do they know how much it is costing to do the bashing per page of the Congressional Record? Maybe it is a sort of full-employment opportunity for printers. As a printer's son, maybe I ought to be happy, but I do not think this is what my father would think was the best thing for this body to do. 
So, Mr. President, some of this could be humorous if it were not for the enormous cost to the taxpayers, if it were not for the fact that we are not doing what we are supposed to do, if it were not for the fact that the kind of bipartisanship that has always made me proud to be a Member of the U.S. Senate has broken down more than I have ever seen before. Maybe it would be funny if so many people were not hurt. 
The Attorney General will look into any issues that there may be at the White House. She will report back to us, as she is required to do. We can look at that report and we can determine whether we agree with it or not. But as a former prosecutor, I must tell you, I find it very offensive to tell a prosecutor, `Here is what you must do and must not do. Here are the conclusions you must reach and must not reach.' 
That is basically what this resolution is saying and it is also saying: `Oh, by the way--by the way--there's one thing thou shalt not do. Thou shalt not ask any question of a Member of Congress. We, the Republicans, who control the majority in the Congress, are saying, thou shalt not ask questions of us, what we might have done in fundraising.' I will guarantee you, Mr. President, when we bring up an alternative resolution which calls on the Attorney General to look at Members of Congress, that in lockstep the Republican majority will vote that down. A herd of elephants will trample that into the dust. 
Why is that? They say, go investigate the President. We have already spent $30, $40 million investigating the President and found nothing that says he has done anything wrong. We have already spent about $30, $40 million on a special prosecutor, who also goes out and gives speeches to organizations that seek to defeat the President. We spent $30, $40 million on a special prosecutor who has clients whose PAC's have worked very hard to defeat the President. We spent $30, $40 million on a special prosecutor who would not recognize a conflict of interest if it hit him up alongside the head. 
Now they say, `Let's just go after the President some more, but, please, make sure you understand what we are saying: Don't touch us.' It reminds me of the tax debate where the distinguished former chairman of the Finance Committee, and one of the real giants of the Senate, Russell Long, in debate said, `The kind of taxes we want are, don't tax me, don't tax thee; tax the man behind the tree.' Well, in this case, my good friends on the Republican side want to hide behind that tree and say, `Investigate everybody on the other side of the tree. Don't look at us.' 
I would like to think, Mr. President, this is because all the Members who are going to vote against any investigation of the Senate or the House, all the Members who want to block that, are as pure as Caesar's wife. I would like to follow that analogy, Mr. President, but I could not do it with a straight face. 
It is really very blatant what is going on here. The majority does not want to have a vote on a budget. The majority does not want to have a vote on a chemical weapons treaty. Lord knows, the majority does not want to do anything significant in filling the 100 vacancies now persisting in the Federal courts. And those vacancies will grow just through the normal retirements, deaths, and so forth. But let them pound the President. 
Oh, I would not be surprised if at some point in here we will probably have a resolution calling for the President's speedy recovery from the surgery this afternoon, but they will just pound the heck out of him in the meantime. 
You know, Mr. President, I am not sure anybody is fooled by this. If it was just a silly partisan exercise, it would be one thing. At most, it would be an embarrassment to the U.S. Senate. But it goes beyond that. Because now we find that not only--not 
only--has there been an unprecedented attack on the Constitution by blocking Federal judges, but now the other shoe has dropped. We have heard from Members in the other body that they want the impeachment of judges. If they disagree with their decision, they want them impeached. 
I say to my friends on the other side who are calling for impeachments, they should take the time--I was going to say to `reread' a history book, but I think that might be presupposing to say `reread' one--but go and read a history book. And I cannot say `reread' the Constitution, because that also presupposes they read it. Read the Constitution. 
This Nation, the greatest democracy that history has ever known, the most powerful nation on Earth and still remaining a democracy, is here because of the independence of the three branches of Government: The legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. 
Mr. President, everywhere I go in this country and throughout the world I find such enormous respect for our independent Federal judiciary. Look at some of the countries that are seeking democracy. One of the biggest problems they have is that they have never had an independent judiciary. We pride ourselves on our independent judiciary. But for us to say, `I disagreed with a decision, impeach him,' it is like Alice in Wonderland, the queen saying, `Off with their heads, off with their heads.' It is that silly. 
There are, after all, appellate courts. I have tried cases. I have won some and I have lost some. I have known I could always appeal. That is what you do. If a judge rules differently than you like, appeal the decision. Do not say `Oh, we'll impeach them.' What kind of respect do you think there will be for our Federal courts if that could be done? 
This makes me think, Mr. President, of those who had billboards out `Impeach the Supreme Court' because the Court ruled against segregation. It was wrong then for those who wanted to violate the independence of our courts because the courts dared point their finger at the sin and the stain of segregation. It was just as wrong then as it is today. 
If my friends on the other side persist in destroying the independence of our Federal judiciary, what kind of a legacy do they leave their children and their children's children? 
My children will live most of their lives in the next century. I think to myself every day, what kind of a century will we give to them if, after 200 years of building up the greatest democracy history has ever known, we start with this piece and this piece, tearing down what made it a great democracy, tearing down the Constitution, tearing down the independent judiciary, and, yes, Mr. President, tearing down the Senate and tearing down the House by our own statements and by our own actions? That is wrong. 
Mr. President, before this gets any further out of control, I pray that Republicans and Democrats will start coming back together as we did under the great leaders with whom I have had a privilege to serve--Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell and now Senator Daschle, and on the other side, Senator Baker and Senator Dole. These were men who were willing to fight for their partisan beliefs but who knew that there were some issues where the American people have to be heard first and foremost and that we needed to come together. 
I pray that our Members might pause here today--at least let the President of the United States go to surgery this afternoon without us trying to tear him apart--and ask ourselves, Republicans and Democrats alike, what are we doing to the Senate? What are we doing to the House? What are we doing to our Federal Judiciary? What are we doing to the protection of our Constitution when we say judges should be impeached not for high crimes and misdemeanors, as the Constitution speaks of, but because we disagree with them? 
If anybody has ever tried cases, and I have tried a lot of cases, you will find judges to disagree with. The other side might be delighted. The next week the judge may agree with you and the other side is angry. That is the way it works. I tried a lot of cases in the appellate court and I have tried a lot of cases in trial courts. However, sometimes I disagreed with a determination. 
Mr. President, when I began this statement there were no other Senators on the floor seeking recognition. I now see my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island and will suspend my remarks at this point to allow him an opportunity to be heard.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to my good friend from Kentucky, who has been my good friend from the time we first met as newly elected Members of the class of 1974. We came here together, and I can honestly say, Mr. President, that I have looked to Senator Ford for guidance on every issue since then. I came from a small county office, and he came from being Governor of a State much larger than Vermont ever has been or ever will be. 
I remember debates we had when we were in the majority and in the minority, and back to the majority and then back to the minority. Wendell Ford's was one of the voices we would listen to as we tried to find the answers that made sense for the country and for each other. 
Wendell Ford also had a quality that was very much the quality of all Senators, Republican and Democrat, when he first came here--a quality that, perhaps, some today should remind themselves of, because it existed universally then, and that is the quality of when a Senator gives his word, his word is gold. There is not one single person who has served here in the 22 years that Wendell Ford has been here who has ever questioned his word. There is not one single Senator here who found him to be someone who did not keep totally to his commitments. 
What I have enjoyed in our personal relationship is that he is a man I have been able to go to for counsel and guidance and know that I could discuss anything with him without it ever being given out, if I told him it was in confidence. 
Marcelle and I have been privileged to be here with Jean and Wendell Ford. They are the kind of people that future generations of the Senate should look to for the best, not just for Kentucky, but for the country. Ultimately, what is most important in this body is not whether you are liberal, moderate, or conservative, but whether you serve with integrity for the best interests of the country. I have served with many, many people who fit that description, but I have been fortunate that, for 22 years, I have served here with a man who epitomizes that--Wendell Ford of Kentucky. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to wish Arnie Aronson a happy 86th birthday and to commend him on his many achievements. 
Arnie has been working for civil rights for over 50 years. He began at a time when help wanted ads openly specified `Gentile only' or `Irish need not apply.' In the early 1940's he organized a coalition of religious, ethnic, civil rights, social welfare, and labor organizations into the Chicago Council Against Religious and Racial Discrimination. By 1950 he was working with Roy Wilkins and many others to organize support for President Truman's proposed civil rights effort and engineered the combination of national organizations that created the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. 
He and the leadership Conference were instrumental in the enactment of the first extensive Federal civil rights laws since Reconstruction, the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, the fundamental Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the pivotal Fair Housing Act of 1968. They have been critical to our civil rights efforts at every turn every since. 
The statement of purpose he drafted for the Leadership Conference says a great deal about this extraordinary man and his dedication to the rights of all: 
We are committed to an integrated, democratic, plural society in which every individual is accorded equal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice and in which every group is accorded an equal opportunity to enter fully into the general life of the society with mutual acceptance and regard for difference. 
Arnie went on to help organize clergy, churches, and synagogues. He was a founding member of the National Urban Coalition and a charter member of Common Cause. In the last 10 years, while well in his 70's, he assumed the presidency of the Leadership Conference Education Fund and helped invigorate its educational and public service activities. 
While he gave leadership and inspiration to the country he never forgot his family. I know the influence he had on his niece and nephew, Jenette and Si Kahn. 
Their lives were changed as were ours. I wish him a happy birthday.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont. I thank him for his strong support on the issue of Ngawang Choephel. He and I have heard from so many Vermonters who met Ngawang Choephel at his time in Middlebury and feel as we do. 
I also thank Senator Moynihan for his support of this former Middlebury College student and this Fulbright scholar, and also for his support of other prisoners of conscience in Tibet. Senator Moynihan has been a stalwart supporter of Tibet and its people for as long as I can remember. The fact he has sponsored this resolution gives added weight to it. 
Like so many in Vermont, I was outraged when I heard of Mr. Choephel's 18-year prison sentence in December. This followed a secret trial and followed a year of incommunicado detention. The Chinese Government has not released a shred of evidence that Mr. Choephel committed any crime. In fact, I understand the entire 16 hours of videotape that he sent out of Tibet prior to his arrest contained only footage of traditional Tibetan music and dance. That is what he studied at Middlebury College and that is the reason he returned to Tibet. 
The frustrating aspect of this is that China has done so much to destroy a lot of the tradition of Tibet, the history, the writings, the music, the dance. Mr. Choephel was simply preserving for future generations what is so important in this ancient, ancient culture. When the Chinese authorities finally acknowledged that Mr. Choephel had been arrested, and they did not do that until a year after he disappeared despite numerous inquiries on his behalf, the State Department called for his immediate release. Even after he was convicted, the Chinese Government refused to release any information to support the charge against him. 
Many of us suspect that his arrest and sentence were intended to intimidate the Dalai Lama's supporters in the United States. The Dalai Lama's supporters have voiced their support for Mr. Choephel, but I am not aware of any relationship between Mr. Choephel and the Dalai Lama. If the Chinese authorities' purpose was to scare off these supporters, they are going to be disappointed. It is only going to embolden those like myself who support Tibet and its people. 
I have written several letters to Chinese and United States officials, as has Senator Jeffords and Representative Sanders and others. I was in Beijing in November, and I asked President Jiang Zemin personally about the case of Ngawang Choephel, and I raised the case of Ngawang Choephel with the other Chinese authorities with whom I met. Just last week I sent letters to President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Gore. The Vice President is due to travel to China in the near future. Those letters were signed by the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and by Senators Feinstein, Glenn, Kempthorne, and Dorgan, all of whom were on the November delegation to China. 
Of course there have been all kinds of articles and editorials on Mr. Choephel's behalf in this country. 
I said to the Chinese that here, at a time when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Fulbright Scholarship Program, a Fulbright scholar from Vermont is arrested unjustly. It shows a lack of any sense of history on the part of the Chinese in this because, of course, the first Fulbright scholarships 50 years ago were used in China. Now, on the 50th anniversary of the Fulbright scholarship, the Chinese arrest a person who was simply recording an ancient culture. 
So, our resolution calls for the release of Ngawang Choephel. It urges United States officials to raise his case in their meetings with China's officials, to support a resolution on human rights in Tibet and China at the U. N. Commission on Human Rights, to urge the Chinese Government to allow international human rights groups to monitor human rights in Tibet, and to support an exchange program for Tibetan students. It says, instead of bringing the curtain down on Tibet, open the doors to Tibet, open them to this wonderful, wonderful culture. 
The resolution makes clear to the Chinese Government that the United States Senate considers improvements and respect for human rights in China and Tibet a priority. There would be no better way for the Chinese Government to demonstrate sincerity on human rights than to release Mr. Choephel. 
This resolution and the support for Mr. Choephel that we all share are not intended to embarrass or unfairly single out China. We want relations between our two great countries to improve. But our purpose is to call attention to a terrible mistake that has been made in the hope that China's Government will review the case and set Mr. Choephel free. I intend to keep writing and speaking about Ngawang Choephel until that day comes. So I thank Senator Moynihan for his leadership as well as the other dozens of Members of Congress, the hundreds of Vermonters, and Americans around the country who have signed letters in support of Ngawang Choephel. 
The Chinese should look at the names on these resolutions. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue, not conservative or liberal issue. It goes across the political spectrum in this body. What it says is that we are as interested in human rights 
as anybody else. It also says, when you have an ancient culture like the Tibetans', an ancient religion, ancient music, ancient writings and speakings, they cannot be stamped out by anybody and they should not be stamped out by anybody. The Chinese should respect the culture of the Tibetans. 
The Tibetans pose no threat to the People's Republic of China. But actions in trying to suppress, to eliminate, to destroy their religion, their culture, their music and their writings, that poses a threat to all, including those of us in the United States, the greatest democracy on Earth.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have been considering this proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution of the United States since this session began almost 2 months ago. In fact, we have been engaged in floor debate for nearly 4 weeks. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have begun to think we live on this floor with this debate. 
Mr. President, stop and think what we are debating--a proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution. The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. During this time, the United States has been through some very, very serious situations--the War of 1812, the Civil War, two world wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Great Depression, westward expansion. One would have to assume during that time, there have been hundreds and hundreds of times that we have seen crises in our Nation that, some would say, reached a constitutional magnitude. We know that hundreds, even thousands, of constitutional amendments have been proposed, but those who have gone before us have seen fit to only amend the Constitution 17 times--which was very wise--since the Bill of Rights. 
I say this because nobody in the Senate owns a seat in the Senate. We are only passing through, no matter how long we serve. What we ought to do is remember that we have a responsibility not only to those who went before us, but those who will come after. So during this debate, some of us have tried to look at the substance behind this bumper-sticker title and even the poll-driven politics that led to this proposal, again occupying the No. 1 position in the majority's legislative agenda. 
We have examined the resolution in our Judiciary Committee hearings, markup and report and during the Senate debate. We have become, and certainly the American people have become, more and more aware of the serious substantial failings in this proposal. I believe this debate has shown any objective observer that this resolution fails to meet the standards set by our founders in article V of the Constitution for its amendment: It cannot be found necessary by two-thirds of this Senate. 
Moreover, the proponents have failed to answer the serious questions raised about the various provisions over the past several weeks. They have failed the Byrd challenge by being unable to demonstrate what it means and how it would work. The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia came on this floor and, in his usual careful manner, his usual sense of history, his usual understanding of the Constitution, asked the pertinent questions: How would it work? What does it mean? What does it do? And no answer was forthcoming. Having now had an opportunity to focus on the language of the resolution before us, none of us can be confident concerning its meaning or its use. 
During the course of this debate, we have had the principal proponents of the resolution concede that it does not require a balanced budget, but that it is intended to provide incentive to balance the Federal budget and exert pressure on Congress. It is intended just to make us do our job. That is not sufficient reason to amend the Constitution. As the President said in his State of the Union Message, we have but to vote a balanced budget, he has but to sign it to have a balanced budget. We do not have to tinker with the Constitution in a way that would actually throw the whole matter over to the courts, not to the President and the Congress. 
The President and Congress have shown over the past 4 years that we can make progress undoing the mistakes of the deficit-building decades of the 1980's without a proposed amendment to the Constitution. We succeeded in reducing the deficit in each of the last 4 years. We have cut the deficit by more than 60 percent. At the same time, we are pursuing sound economic and fiscal policies doing those things that have made the United States economy the strongest in the world. 
What we are now asked to do is tinker with obvious success. But more than that, we are asked to give people something they can 
put on a bumper sticker that says, `I voted to balance the budget,' when, indeed, it does not do that, instead of saying, `I voted to really mess up the Constitution,' which is what it would do. 
I hope that we will think not only of our political fortunes of this day and the political polls of our State of this moment, but think of the United States and think of those who will come after us. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we talk about how many votes there may be and we talk about this debate, which, incidentally, has been interfered with in some ways over the weekend, at the same time we talk about evil money in politics. We have seen some so-called `independent' expenditures in running ads on this. They are about as independent as absolutely nothing. I think it is unfortunate that apparently the proponents of this constitutional amendment do not feel that they can make their case well enough on the Senate floor. They have to do this. 
We talk about whether it is one vote or not. Let us talk about votes. In 1993, we started down this road to concerted, consistent deficit reduction. We did that without a single Republican vote in either the House or the Senate for the President's budget. After 12 years of ever-larger deficits, voted for by the Republican Members of Congress, when we finally started cutting the deficit, not a single Republican Member voted to do that. 
Over the last 4 years, we have succeeded in reducing the deficit by 63 percent. It went up for 12 years; the national debt went up. We started bringing the deficit down. When President Clinton took office, the deficit was at its highest point ever--$290 billion. Today, the deficit is at its lowest dollar figure since 1981, $107 billion. In fact, it is at the lowest point as a percentage of the economy since 1974. 
In his testimony to the committee, Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that over the past 10 years the deficit has actually declined 70 percent as a percentage of gross domestic product--5.1 percent in 1986 to 1.4 percent in 1996. In fact, as a percentage of gross domestic product, our deficit is now at the lowest level of any major industrialized nation in the world. The deficit is at the lowest level of any industrialized nation in the world. We are the envy of the rest of the world. But it has taken some political courage to do that. And the budgets are starting to bring that deficit down. 
I say to my good friends in the Republican Party, it was done without a single vote from their side of the aisle, notwithstanding those deficits grew up over 12 years of Republican administrations. 
The record of deficit reduction is an accomplishment of the Clinton administration. It is an accomplishment that the Clinton administration's policies have restored fiscal sanity and have kept the economy strong. The result of the recent election is testimony that the American people recognize these facts. In fact, were it not for the interest on the $2.462 trillion debt that was rung up during President Reagan's term and President Bush's term, our budgets over the last several years would already have been in balance. 
Just think of that. They ran up a debt of $2.462 trillion. The rest of the budget, including entitlements, is already balanced. We didn't need a constitutional amendment to do that. All we needed was courage. If we were not paying the interest on that debt run up, we would be totally in balance. 
This deficit progress has been achieved through tough votes over the last 4 years. But we have seen its impact on our growing economy with lower interest rates. In 1980, the annual interest on the national debt accumulated over our entire history was $75 billion. Think about this. In 1980, when President Reagan came to office, it took a whole national debt to accumulate over 200 years, and the interest was $75 billion. Yet, when 12 years of Republican administrations ended, that amount had skyrocketed. So the interest on the national debt is now $248 billion. 
We had failed fiscal economic policies of the last decade, and we are paying the price. These interest payments on the national debt remain too high, and they have to be reduced further. But the proposed constitutional amendment, were it to pass, only allows Members of Congress who don't want to step up and cast the tough votes to bring down the deficit to say when the Constitution is going to do it. We can delay congressional action. Eventually we will toss it into the courts and let them do it. 
Frankly, I wish Congress and the President would, instead of talking about a debate here that will go nowhere, sit down and do the tough things that are necessary to bring the budget under control. 
Mr. President, I notice that the other side now has another speaker. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I listened to the debate on the floor of the Senate, I heard that the budget deficits begin in Congress and not with the President. Let's look at the facts. During the Reagan years President Reagan got 99.999 percent of everything he asked for in the budget, including the deficit. In fact, during those years President Reagan vetoed only one appropriations bill. Only one spending bill did President Reagan veto. Why? Because it didn't spend as much money as he had requested. Congress actually had come back with less money than he requested. So he vetoed the bill and asked for more money. 
So let's just fully understand what happened. It was the same way with the Bush administration. The budget was what the President asked for. But let's assume that it begins here in the Congress. Then, I ask my friends in the Republican majority, where is your budget? You can't have it both ways. You can't say that the budget deficits are the fault of the Congress and those who lead the Congress. Republicans lead the Congress. Where is the budget? 
Instead of spending weeks and weeks and weeks on the floor debating how we might amend the Constitution--it has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights--instead of debating why we would amend the Constitution with an amendment that even its proponents can't explain its consequences, trying to amend the Constitution just because somebody is taking a poll and says that is popular without going into the details of what is involved, instead of spending all of the time doing that, why not actually negotiate the details of the historic agreement of trying to balance the budget? Why aren't we doing that? Because it is easier to pass a constitutional amendment which is so flawed that even its proponents cannot say what it does to Social Security, what it does to a capital budget, what it does to a court challenge, what it does to the power of purse. It is easier to do that than to sit down and say, let's talk about the tough votes, let's talk about what we do with school lunch, let's talk about what we do with the defense budget, let's talk about what we do with Medicare, let's talk about what we do with Medicaid, let's talk about what we do with a farm program, or a foreign program, and on and on and on. 
That means that every time you come up to vote, you are going to anger somebody; you are going to anger a special interest group on the right, or you are going to anger a special interest group on the left. 
So it is a lot easier to say, let's just toss it over to the courts, let's toss it over to a constitutional amendment, let's toss it to something that we can't even explain. We can't even say what it does to Social Security or to a capital budget or anything else. But we can go home with a slogan that has been tested by the polls and by focus groups. We can say, `I voted to balance the budget.' Boloney. It is sort of like me voting to grow hair. It might make me feel good, but `it ain't gonna work.' It is the same thing here. 
In light of all we have experienced, but also what we have accomplished in the last 4 years in bringing the deficit down in each of those 4 years, there is no basis today for seriously contending that a constitutional amendment is needed or that it is a necessary substitute for political will or even that it is the only way to achieve a balanced budget. We have shown in 4 years of bringing down the deficit--and now going into a fifth--that there are other ways. 
During the course of time that has been reserved for debate on this proposed constitutional amendment, there has been a good deal of talk about the President's proposed budget. The President made a State of the Union Address on February 4. He submitted his statement on his proposed balanced budget the following day. Then on the next day, February 6, the President sent his proposed budget to Congress. My good friends in the Republican Party have been quick to criticize that proposed budget, but they left out one thing in their criticism. They never said where their budget is or what their budget does. I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, Where is your budget? If you want to say that the budgets really come from the Congress, you are in the majority. You run the Congress. 
You turn the lights on in the morning. You turn them off at night. In between, prepare a budget. Where is the alternative? Where are the proposed amendments to the President's plan? 
I hope that we do not get into partisan harping and carping and, instead, get on to the process of developing a bipartisan consensus. It is not going to be easy, Mr. President. Like so many other Members who have voted to bring the deficit down 4 years in a row, I bear the scars of saying no to every special interest group from the right to the left when I voted for cut after cut after cut--the farm bill being one good example of that, the Lugar-Leahy farm bill. Item after item, we have done it not by gimmicks but by solid votes. But it has been a month now and we have not seen a proposal for modification of the President's budget nor have we seen an alternative for the majority party. The President even came to Capitol Hill to meet with congressional leaders, going the extra mile--going the extra 2 or 3 miles. 
We are fast approaching our statutorily imposed deadline of April 15 for a budget resolution. So let's see what this budget resolution is going to be, and let's debate it. Let's proceed to debate the budget and, in the words of Secretary Rubin, `finish the job of balancing the budget by the year 2002.' It has been 4 years of bringing the deficit down, and we are about go into the fifth year of bringing it down. Let's get a budget that does the job. 
What it means is that the Republicans and the Democrats are going to have to hold hands, and we are going to have to vote in a way that is going to offend some of our core constituencies. But the American people in the long run will be better off. Certainly the American people would be better off and the world's strongest economy would be better off without tinkering with the Constitution, which basically becomes a judicial nightmare and does nothing to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also have great affection and respect for the Senator from Nevada. I know to err is human and to forgive divine. While I make no claims of divinity, I forgive him for his position on this. 
I also point out both the distinguished Senator from Nevada and the distinguished Senator from Utah are two of the hardest working Members of this body. In their debate, they have been strong and forthright, as has the distinguished Presiding Officer, who made his first speech on the Senate floor on this issue. I noted at that time, so many times when one gives his or her first speech on the floor it is on an inconsequential item. This time, it was one of the most important items that the distinguished Presiding Officer will have a chance to debate during his tenure in this body. 
I say this because I think during the past weeks of debate, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, have tried to fulfill our responsibility as one of the two Houses of Congress to create a full and fair record. Sometimes it may have seemed tiring, for the distinguished Senator from Utah and myself, as floor managers, to be here. But the more we have listened, the more we have realized that this is one of those issues where a strong and full debate record has been made. Even if those of us who have been here may not realize that at this moment, certainly historians will. 
I believe most of the men and women in this body, in both parties, have approached this historic debate with a seriousness the consideration of a constitutional amendment requires. Every one of us should pause and think: We vote either to amend the Constitution or not to amend the Constitution. With the exception of a vote to declare war or with the exception of one or two other areas, I cannot think of anything that approaches the seriousness of voting on a constitutional amendment. No Member of the Senate should take that lightly. All Members of the Senate should think they may only once in their lifetimes actually have a vote that will determine whether the long and almost sacred process of amending our Constitution begins. So we should think long and hard how we vote. 
Those of us who expressed our reluctance to amend the Constitution, for this or many other issues, have at least said, if we are going to amend the Constitution, let us make sure the amendment is as good as can be written. 
We have offered serious and substantial amendments to this proposal. I believe the amendments that we have offered--all from this side of the aisle--have revealed serious and substantial flaws in this proposed change to our Constitution. 
What has bothered me in this debate is instead of addressing these serious and substantial flaws, instead of acknowledging what writers outside the Senate have acknowledged, that the proposed change to the Constitution is flawed, but instead of addressing the substantial flaws, the sponsors of the resolution have proceeded with a no-amendment strategy, in which they have failed to consider the merits of the amendments. I think there was an up-or-down vote only one of the amendments. The others were all tabled. The sponsors of this proposed constitutional amendment have taken the unyielding position that no changes in the language are acceptable. 
I cannot think of an instance that a major and contentious issue has reached the Senate floor where Members have not realized, before its conclusion, that there may well have to be some changes. During the weeks of debate on Senate Joint Resolution 1, this no-amendment strategy has been a disappointment to many, certainly to the senior Senator from Vermont. I do not believe this is the way to debate an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Both proponents and opponents of this proposed constitutional change should be searching for the best language possible to propose to the States. 
My own feelings, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, is that if this is going to pass, let it at least pass in the best possible form. Today, it is a long way from that. 
As the distinguished Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], said, `Good is simply not good enough when we are amending the Constitution of the United States.' 
Frankly, Mr. President, constitutional amendments are held to a higher standard. The perfecting and substitute amendments offered during the debate on this amendment showed the serious and substantial flaws, and I will recall a few of them. 
I will continue speaking. I have already talked with my good friend from Utah about when a Member on the other side comes and seeks recognition, I will, of course, yield for him or her to speak. But while waiting for that, let me talk about a few of these amendments. 
We had the Durbin amendment. The distinguished Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], offered the first amendment during our debate, and it highlighted the fact that Senate Joint Resolution 1 is unsound economic policy. What he did in his amendment would have allowed us to waive this article by majority vote in the event of an economic recession or a serious economic emergency. 
His amendment had the underpinning of the statements of more than a thousand of the Nation's most respected economists, including at least 11 Nobel laureates and the former chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, the current and former Federal Reserve Board Chairman, the former Democratic and Republican directors of the Congressional Budget Office. All agreed that the underlying resolution, Senate Joint Resolution 1, was unsound economic policy. They all agreed that it would hamper the Government's ability to cope with economic downturns. 
Treasury Secretary Rubin, one of the most respected Treasury Secretaries I have served with in my 22 years here, testified before the Judiciary Committee:  
A balanced budget amendment would subject the Nation to unacceptable economic risk in perpetuity. This balanced budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions and recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions. 
I think of the history books that tell us that as the United States was going into its greatest depression, President Herbert Hoover, wanting to give credibility to the American people and hope to them, instituted a balanced-budget policy. It was like throwing gasoline on to the smoldering embers of an embryonic depression, and what might have been only a slight recession became a depression that destroyed the hopes and dreams of many of our 
parents and grandparents. It was a depression that wreaked the greatest havoc in the lives of American people in this century. It was a depression that caused great migration of people from various parts of our country, nearly wreaked our farm economy, our agrarian economy, and destroyed the hopes and dreams of families in every part of America. 
What we have done now is say if your State or region is hit by a major recession or emergency that a minority of Senators or a minority of Representatives could stop a Federal response to that major recession or emergency. Although the sponsors of this measure repeatedly outline the dangers of a budget deficit, they fail to address how the proposed constitutional amendment will provide for the flexibility needed in economic downturns without holding working families in hard-hit regions hostage to a supermajority vote. Senator Durbin's amendment would have restored that flexibility by requiring a majority vote to respond to economic recessions and emergencies. 
But the sponsors and proponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 opposed the Durbin amendment. The sponsors and proponents of the underlying resolution did not offer alternative language to address the real economic concerns surrounding Senate Joint Resolution 1. Instead, with lockstep voting, they defeated the Durbin amendment by a vote of 64 to 35. Having forced this effort to be tabled on February 10, and they rejected the Torricelli amendment on February 26, the Republican leadership hinted this weekend that they are now themselves finally considering an amendment along these lines but have not brought one forward. 
It is ironic, last Friday, the Senate passed an air ticket tax--they reinstated one that had lapsed--imposed a significant tax without a recorded vote by unanimous consent. I wonder whether the proponents of the provisions of the underlying resolution would draft in the Constitution a requirement that such measures only be passed by a constitutional majority after a recorded vote. In this body the majority leader called up the matter, and, in moments, it was done. I am not suggesting it should not have been done, but it is also reality. This is a significant tax. It is a significant tax from which the American people benefit. Hopefully, it will make our airports safer, air traffic more efficient and safer, and we benefit by it. But it was not reinstated with a recorded vote. 
I withhold the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I had other amendments I was going to speak to, but I see the distinguished Senator from Maryland on the floor who is seeking time. How much time does the Senator from Maryland want?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on my time, if we are going to go by rating, I say to my friend from Maryland, let's see how we would rate. I think probably one way of rating is our deficit as a share of GDP. I say this because we do it for ourselves. We talk about having our household budgets in line. As a U.S. Senator, I own a home, of course. But my real home is in Vermont. 
But I have a home to use when I am down in the Senate. Now, I do as almost all Vermonters, unless they have a lot more money than I do. I buy that with a mortgage. I could not pay for those homes all in 1 year. I am in deficit.

I look at the chart that he has been good enough to bring up, and I think that the United States is rating pretty darned good. We are an awful lot better in our deficit than all the rest of the First World--Japan, Germany, Canada, France, UK, Italy. I think our bonds would be pretty darned good. I say this to my friend from Maryland. We all know we are in about as much of a global market certainly as at any time in the Senator's lifetime or my lifetime, and markets become even more global as we go on with everything from the Internet to plants worldwide. I ask my friend, what is the dominant currency when we talk about that global market? Is it not the dollar?

I hope, though, that those who watch this debate around the world will realize that we are making debate on what is the world's strongest economy, the strongest economy recorded history has ever shown. I worry sometimes when I hear this denigration of our economy and that we need gimmicks to fix it. It is like some of the debate on the military budget during the cold war: Oh, my God, we are falling so far behind, until someone said, well, would we trade our Air Force for the Soviet Air Force or our Navy for the Soviet Navy or our Army for the Soviet Army? And everybody said, Oh, of course not. I ask just one question. Would we trade the U.S. economy for any economy in the world? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not take long. I hear these debates, and I still say the same thing: All we need is the courage to vote. We all give great speeches about the need for a balanced budget, but I remember the Senate and the Senate leadership during the time of President Reagan endorsing huge deficits. In fact, we are still paying the interest on the deficits run up during the Reagan and Bush administrations, as contrasted to the Clinton administration where the deficit has come down 4 years in a row and is about to come down for the fifth year, something that has not happened in the lifetime of most of us in this body. 
But to bring it down, you don't pass a bumper-sticker slogan and stick it on the Constitution of the United States of America. To bring it down, you cast difficult votes, unpopular votes, votes that make you stand up to special interests and single-issue groups from the right to the left. 
What we are trying to do is to pass some kind of a feel-good amendment that would send most of this to the courts, that would cripple the strongest economy in the world. Let us remember that, with all those who come and talk about the dangers of our economy, I ask them, what country in the world would they trade economies with? We have the strongest economy in the world. It is like the days of the Soviet Union when everybody said, `Well, our military is falling apart,' and we say, `Do you want to trade our Air Force for theirs, our Army for theirs, our Navy for theirs?' We have to say no. 
When we have the strongest economy in the world, when we have a deficit that is the smallest as percentage of our gross domestic product of any in the industrialized world, let's not start talking about trading what is working for countries that do not work anywhere near as well as what we have. Let us back off from the political siren call of saying, `We'll do this on a bumper-sticker slogan slapped on to the Constitution,' the greatest Constitution in the world, because then some day somebody else, probably a Federal court, will do what we can do today. 
I know that we cannot legislate political courage and responsibility, but that is what we are trying to say we are going to do. No amendment to the Constitution can supply the representatives of the people of this great country with political courage and responsibility. Indeed, the majority report on this amendment concludes that the ultimate enforcement mechanism that can lead to balancing the budget is the electorate's power to vote. How true, but that power to vote doesn't come in 10 years from now in a constitutional amendment. That power to vote has been there throughout the history of this great country. The underlying resolution would actually cut, rather than enhance, our democratic principles of majority rule and separation of powers but ultimately lead to less accountability to the electorate. Why would it do that? Because it would destroy majority rule, and it would turn all contested issues of the budget over to the courts, not to the elected people of this country. 
Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us achieve remarkable deficit reduction over the past 4 years. That is a history that those who support this flimflam on the Constitution choose to ignore. We have succeeded in reducing the deficit every year of the past 4, we have cut the deficit by more than 60 percent in that time, and we have had a strong economy and sound fiscal policy. We did not do that through a flimflam amendment. We did that through political courage. 
It meant that some Members of this body and some Members of the other body actually lost their seats in the Congress by voting for what was right--but they did it--and reminds all of us that nobody owns a seat in the U.S. Senate. Nobody should have their decisions guided solely by polls, but rather by what is right. 
So why do we not stay the course of what we have been doing, bringing the deficit down and use bipartisan work for further progress? It is an illusionary quick fix by constitutional amendment, and it makes the job more difficult. 
The questions raised during this debate will not go away and cannot be ignored. They point to a series of fatal flaws in proposing and conducting our economic and budgetary functions this way. 
A recent editorial in Vermont by the Burlington Free Press said it: 
Amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget amendment would be like using a sledgehammer to nail a picket in a fence. The picket might stand, but at great risk to the fence. 
I think of what Senator Hatfield said when he stood up and opposed this. Senator Hatfield, then the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said: 
The debate on the balanced budget amendment is not about reducing the budget deficit. It is about amending the Constitution of the United States with a procedural gimmick. 
What I say is, it is amending the Constitution with a bumper-sticker flimflam. That is what it is doing. 
Senator Hatfield said: 
As I stated during the debate on the balanced budget amendment last year, a vote for this balanced budget amendment is not a vote for a balanced budget, it is a vote for a figleaf. 
Mr. President, it is a pretty small figleaf. We ought to be embarrassed to put that figleaf on anything, especially on the greatest Constitution democracy has ever known. 
Senator Hatfield said: 
Congress should not promise to the people to balance the Federal budget through a procedural gimmick. If the Congress has a political will to balance the budget, it should simply use the power that it already has to do so. There is no substitute for political will. And there never will be. 
Our Senate oath of office has in it a promise to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. We owe to our constituents our best judgment on this. We owe to our children and our children's children our best judgment. 
My children will live most of their lives in the next century. I want them to live in that century with the best Constitution democracy has ever known. We demean the Constitution with this amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry the Republican whip was unable to yield to me for an observation, but I will make this observation. He condemns President Clinton, who is the only President since he has been here in the Senate who has brought the deficit down 4 years in a row. He says it may go up in future years. I remind the Republican whip, my good friend from Oklahoma, that the Republicans have the majority of Senators and the Republicans have the majority of House Members. If they do not like the budget of the President, all they have to do is pass their own. But to this day they have not brought forward one page, one paragraph, one sentence or one word of a budget that would do better than what Bill Clinton has done.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the Senator from West Virginia to arrive--and my understanding is there is not someone on the other side now asking to speak--I will, within the time on this side, continue some comments I made earlier this morning. 
I talked about the fact that the amendments were, in almost lockstep fashion, knocked down by the proponents of the constitutional amendment. I was concerned about that because even many of the supporters of a constitutional amendment spoke in their testimony before the Judiciary Committee of the basic flaws in this amendment as worded. 
When we go to amend the Constitution of the United States, the constitution of the greatest democracy in history, we have at least an obligation to our Nation, and certainly to the Constitution, the bedrock of our democracy, to do it in an understanding way, not as some kind of a slapdash, bumper-sticker, sloganeering fashion that raises more questions than it answers. 
The amendment before us leaves wide open questions of Social Security and how that is going to be handled. It leaves wide open the questions of a capital budget. 
Just before we recessed for the caucuses, a proponent of the balanced budget amendment spoke about Thomas Jefferson and how Thomas Jefferson said that he would have liked to have had a balanced budget amendment. Well, now, let us stop to think about this. Thomas Jefferson borrowed an amount that was equal to twice the budget of the United States for the Louisiana purchase. I mean, this would be like borrowing trillions of dollars today. 
Had President Jefferson had a balanced budget amendment, certainly one like this, he would not have been able to do that. North Dakota would have had the chance to speak Spanish, not English. Our European-sponsored wars probably would have taken place on our continent. Certainly the United States would not be a country described as `from sea to shining sea.' 
These are some of the historical, as opposed to hysterical, facts in this debate. 
Senator Dodd offered an amendment that pointed out another serious flaw in the language of the proposed constitutional amendment. Section 5 of the proposed amendment requires the United States to be engaged in military conflict before a waiver may be obtained. Moreover, the Senate report compounded the problem by indicating that only certain kinds of military conflict may qualify. Only military conflict that involved the actual use of military force may serve as the basis for this waiver. 
Senator Dodd's amendment exposes the folly of this language. It would create constitutional circumstances making military spending and preparations easier only when military force is actually used and military conflict ensues. If you want to arm to deter aggression, that is suddenly no longer the preferred course. If you want to aid allies in a conflict rather than dispatching U.S. military forces, that would no longer be as viable an alternative. 
If you wanted to rebuild our military capabilities after conflict, you could not do it without three-fifths. 
Has nobody read a history book about World War II? Does nobody know what preparations we had to undertake and the possibility that we might go into war? Has nobody read what we did to help other countries? Instead of addressing the serious and substantial concerns raised by Senator Dodd's amendment, the sponsors and proponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 simply opposed the Dodd amendment as creating a loophole in the balanced budget amendment. The proponents did not offer alternative language to address the real military and foreign policy concerns surrounding Senate Joint Resolution 1. Instead, lockstep voting, they defeated the Dodd amendment by a vote of 64-36. And then they rejected those provisions again when they rejected the Torricelli amendment. 
We have probably reached a point, Mr. President, where Senators know how they are going to vote. But I hope that they will go back and read what is in this debate. We have said over and over again that if you really want a balanced budget, just balance it. Vote to do it. This morning, I asked the distinguished Republican whip, `Where is the Republican budget?' You know, we have had this debated on the floor of the Senate, Mr. President, when I have raised the fact that we are now paying the interest on the huge debt brought up in the last two administrations--President Reagan's and President Bush's--and the fact that if we weren't paying the interest on the debt and deficits created just in those two administrations, we would actually have a surplus in our budget today, not a deficit. 
Having said that, the response was, well, now it is not the President who proposes that, it is the Congress that does that. If you want to go into facts, President Reagan got 99.99 percent of everything he ever asked for. Even though he had the veto pen, he only vetoed one spending bill--only one--as each year unprecedented deficits went up, as each year his budget showed greater deficits than had ever been seen in the history of this country, and he vetoed one spending bill. Why? Was it because it spent too much money? No. He vetoed that one bill because it spent less money than he thought it should. The only spending bill President Reagan ever vetoed was one that spent less than what he wanted. 
Let us assume that it is not the President's prerogative to propose a budget. Let us assume it is not the President's plan, and let us assume it is the Congress'. Then I ask, again, my friend, the Republican whip, and others, where is the budget? `Where's the beef?' On April 15, we are supposed to have a budget. Republicans control the Senate and the House. They have a majority in each House. If, indeed, they really want a balanced budget--not a balanced budget gimmick, but a balanced budget--then vote one, pass one. There are 55 Republicans in the Senate. That is a majority. There is a majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives. Just bring up the budget and pass it. Pass it. Pass the actual spending bills and tax bills. 
Last year, even with a majority, they didn't even pass 13 appropriations bills on time. Mr. President, the public should not hold their breath waiting for this to happen. The reason is very simple. It is one thing to pass on to the States a constitutional amendment, no matter how poorly drafted, and say, there, I voted for a balanced budget. You can put that on the bumper sticker on your car, you can put it on the tag line in your campaign, and you can use it in focus groups. Of course, it doesn't balance the budget. It doesn't do one thing. It doesn't change 1 cent of our national debt or the deficit, or 1 cent of the budget. But it sure makes you feel good, and it is a nice political gimmick. But if you cast the hard votes to actually bring the deficit down and actually balance the budget, then you are going to upset special interests from the right to the left. I know. I have voted for an awful lot of cuts to our budget. I voted for programs that brought down the deficit. I voted for programs that cut thousands and tens of thousands of Federal employees off of the rolls. I have voted to cut programs in my own State that closed offices in my State and in the State of the Presiding Officer, and every other place. 
I think I have heard from everybody whose toes I stepped on in those cuts. It is a heck of a lot easier to vote for the constitutional amendment and say everybody is going to agree with you. It is more difficult to make the actual cuts. 
My challenge is this, to all those who say you want a balanced budget. Fine, you have until April 15 to bring one up, and then start making the tough cuts. Mr. President, I guarantee you, we won't see the tough cuts being made, the real efforts to balance the budget. But you are going to hear, once this cockamamy flimflam of a bumper sticker constitutional amendment goes down to defeat this afternoon, you are going to hear everybody saying, `Oh, we lost our chance to have a balanced budget.' My response to that is: You guys are in charge, go ahead and do it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I have previously emphasized, the constitutional amendment is not like a statute that we can revisit, fine tune, revise, or repeal. We have repealed only one constitutional amendment in more than 200 years of our country's history. The only constitutional amendment we have repealed was that of prohibition. 
We ought to remember in this debate that we are being asked to consider an amendment to our Constitution. Before we propose to alter our fundamental charter of freedom--I might say also the blueprint for our representative democracy--we ought to step back from the political passions of the moment. We are debating a proposed constitutional amendment, not just a political slogan, a plank of a campaign platform, or partisan win or lose. 
The Constitution of the United States is a good document. It is not a sacred text, but it is the best law of any that has ever been written. That is why it has survived as the supreme law of this country with very few alterations over 200 years. It has contributed to our success as a nation by binding us together rather than tearing us apart. It contains a great compromise that allowed small States and large States to join together in the spirit of mutual accommodation and respect. It embodies the protections to make real the pronouncements in our historic Declaration of Independence. It gives meaning to our inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
The Constitution requires due process and guarantees equal protection of the law. It protects our freedom of thought and protects our freedom to worship or not as we each choose, and our political freedoms as well. It is the basis of our fundamental rights of privacy and for limiting Government's intrusions--and burdens--into our lives. 
So I oppose what I perceive to be this growing fascination in this country--and, unfortunately, the growing fascination with so many in Congress--to lay waste to our Constitution and the protections that have served us well for over 20 years. The separation of powers amendment is the power of the purse and should be supported and defended. 
The most recent Republican platform endorsed six or seven constitutional amendments, of which this is only the first. In the last Congress, the Senate debated and rejected three proposed amendments. This year that number could well double, or even triple, unless we begin to exercise some discipline and restraint. 
We have only amended the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of Rights. We have only amended it 17 times since the Bill of Rights because those who walked these Halls ahead of us had enough sense that the Constitution came before their political purposes, their polls, their momentary needs. They thought, `How do we protect this Constitution, one of the shortest in the world? How do we protect it and keep it the living, breathing Constitution that it is?'

Mr. LEAHY. They did indeed. As I referred to just before the Senator came on the floor, one of those amendments was, of course, to repeal an earlier amendment. 
Mr. President, I see my friend from North Dakota and my friend from West Virginia on the floor. I will yield the floor with this. 
When we started off in this Congress, each one of us swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That is our duty--all of us--to those who forged this great document. It is our responsibility to those who sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution. It is our commitment to our constituents. It is the legacy to those who will succeed us just as it is showing our responsibility to those who stood up 
before us. 
Mr. President, we talk about our children. My children will live most of their lives in this next century. I want them to have a constitution they can be proud of, not a constitution that fell, injured by momentary political passions. 
I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. LEAHY. I didn't think in 22 years I would be at a loss for words on the floor of the Senate, but that came as close, let me tell you. 
Mr. President, we will come very soon to a vote. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia does deserve enormous credit for standing up each time for the Constitution. Really, that is what I am urging Senators to do. There is no question in my mind that if we took a public opinion poll, the popular thing, the easy thing would be to vote for this constitutional amendment, and we can say, then, as soon as the States ratify it, it is somebody else's problem. 
If we don't stand up and do the things we need to do to protect the Constitution, if we don't stand up and do the things we need to do to bring down the deficit, if we don't stand up and cast the tough and unpopular votes, well, then, somebody can go to court and let the courts straighten it out. 
Mr. President, when I first announced for the U.S. Senate in this week--this very week--in 1974, I was a 33-year-old prosecutor in the only State in the Union that had never elected a member of my party. I told the people of Vermont, `You may not always agree with me on every single thing I will do, but I will make you one pledge: I will hold your interests and the interests of the country foremost. I will follow my best judgment. I will follow my conscience. I will not allow myself to be swayed by passing polls and fancies, and I will always try to do right.' 
I have cast more votes in the U.S. Senate than any Senator in Vermont's history. I have cast more votes in the U.S. Senate, by far, than any Senator in Vermont's history. If I went back through those thousands of votes, I bet I could find a vote or two or three or four that might come as close. Some come to mind, because some of these votes were votes, if I could have cast it on a balance, I would have cast 51 percent one way, 49 percent the other, they were that close. 
I remember the wise advice of the majority leader when I first came here, Senator Mansfield of Montana, who said, `Don't worry if maybe you have some difficulty on a very close vote. Do what you think is right, and if later you determine maybe you made a mistake, the issue will come up again.' It usually does. 
So if I go back to the thousands of votes, I could find one of those 51 to 49 votes, but this is not one of those 51 to 49 votes. On this vote, I have no question in my mind what is the right vote. It is not the popular vote, but it is the right vote, and that is the vote I will cast against this amendment, because we have amended the Constitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights, and two of those amendments crossed each other out: One was for prohibition; one was to end prohibition. All the other amendments have stayed there, because the men and women who came before us carefully considered what was best for the country, what was best for our Constitution, and even though during this time the temptation, the siren song of constitutional amendments has been heard through the Halls of the House and the Senate hundreds and hundreds of times, the siren song has been heard by those campaigning, by those elected and by those defeated, but the siren song was resisted. We are a better country for it. 
This is not a time to try to manipulate the Constitution of the United States of America. This is not a time to put into the Constitution an amendment so flawed, an amendment that leaves more questions unanswered than questions answered, an amendment that may look good on a bumper sticker but stinks like a dead mackerel on the shores of the Constitution. This is not an amendment this Senate should send to the States. 
Rather, what we should do, Republicans and Democrats alike, is join together and pass real budgets, pass those budgets that allow the United States to continue to have the world's strongest economy, an economy that is the envy of every other country, and an economy, incidentally, which has a smaller deficit as part of its gross domestic product than any of the rest of the industrialized world, an economy which is unmatched in recorded history, and realize that there are things that we should spend for. 
Thomas Jefferson borrowed an amount, I think, equal to about twice what the whole budget of the United States was to make the Louisiana purchase. Is there anybody here who would like to see what this country would be like had we not made that Louisiana purchase, had we not had that westward expansion? If we had not been able to go out to our Western States, why, there are some Senators even currently in this Chamber today who might not have States to represent had we not had the Louisiana purchase. 
I ask Senators to think back to when the Constitution was put together. Small States and large States were given an equal voice in this body so that they could maintain their identity. What a great compromise that was, what that did to allow this country to hold together--an advantage, obviously, to my own State of Vermont. But under this constitutional amendment, on matters of spending, on matters of crises, on matters of natural disasters, we would no longer have that parity. We would be left at the whim of the minority, not of the majority. 
So, Mr. President, on this vote, I am sure in my heart and soul I am voting the right way, the right way for the State of Vermont. But I must say to my fellow Vermonters, even more important, it is the right way for our country and our Constitution. 
I was raised in a household brought to revere the Constitution. I have taken an oath to support it in each of my terms in the U.S. Senate, in each of my terms as a prosecuting attorney. I remember each and every time I took that oath because I stopped and thought of what I was swearing allegiance to. It is what sets us apart from all other countries on Earth. It is why we have a Constitution that every one of us should stop and read and reread periodically. It is why, if we have a matter where we want to bring down the deficits, then do it the honest, old-fashioned way, vote to bring it down, vote the hard choices, vote against the special interest groups on the right or left, vote for what is best for the country, but do not pass the responsibility off to our Constitution, to future generations, to the courts to do what we are elected to do, what we are paid to do, and, more important, what we are sworn to do for this country. 
This is something that should unite Democrats and Republicans. When this debate is over and after this vote has gone by, I hope that before we go to more bumper-sticker kinds of debates, that we go to the issues where we can join. Certainly the financial status of this country is one. 
Mr. President, earlier today, I was summarizing the debate that the Senate has had on this proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I would like to continue that discussion to complete the Record on this historic debate. 
REID, FEINSTEIN AND DORGAN AMENDMENTS 
Senator Reid offered a perfecting amendment to exclude the Social Security trust fund from Senate Joint Resolution 1. Senators Feinstein and Dorgan also offered substitute constitutional amendments that would have excluded the Social Security trust fund from the balanced budget mandates. The Reid, Feinstein and Dorgan amendments all focused on removing any threat to Social Security by this proposed constitutional amendment. 
The Social Security Program is America's contract with its senior citizens. Were the underlying resolution to become the basis for a constitutionally-mandated budget balancing act, Social Security would be rendered just another Government program and have its place on the chopping block with everything else. 
Since 1983, Congress has acted to protect Social Security from overall budget cuts. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 required Social Security to be placed off budget within 10 years. That protective legislation passed the Senate 58 to 14 with a strong bipartisan majority. In fact, Congress accelerated this process. Rather than wait 10 years, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, commonly known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, placed Social Security off budget beginning in 1986. This means that the congressional budget resolution in 1985 was the last time that Social Security was included in the Federal budgets that Congress approves each year. 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings permitted across-the-board spending cuts--sequestration--when budgetary goals are not achieved. By its actions placing Social Security off budget, Congress explicitly and intentionally exempted Social Security from the sequestration process. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings--with its protections for Social Security--passed the Senate 61 to 31 with a strong bipartisan majority. 
The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 reinforced earlier protections by placing Social Security even more clearly off budget. This bill, too, passed the Senate 54 to 45 with the bipartisan support of 35 Democrats and 19 Republicans. 
The proposed constitutional amendment turns its back on these many years of bipartisan progress in protecting Social Security from the ebb and flow of efforts to eliminate the deficit. I believe that our senior citizens deserve better. 
When the Government overestimates revenues for an upcoming year, or underestimates expenses, or something changes in the course of the year to influence either, the budget goes out of balance and, under Senate Joint Resolution 1, the Government is out of money. The amendment's mandates would make continued expenditures into constitutional violations of law. If this proposed constitutional amendment were enshrined in the Constitution, it could force the Federal Government to stop making payments for any number of obligations, possibly including payment of Social Security checks, until the budget imbalance could be corrected. 
Treasury Secretary Rubin warned the Judiciary Committee of this great risk, when he testified:  
[T]he amendment poses immense enforcement problems that might well lead to the involvement of the courts in budget decisions, unprecedented impoundment powers for the President or the temporary cessation of all federal payments. Any of these options could disrupt Social Security and Medicare payments. 
Further, if the President and Congress reached a budget impasse under the proposed constitutional amendment, Secretary Rubin cautioned: 
Some proponents have suggested that under these circumstances, the President would stop issuing checks, including those for Social Security benefits. Alternatively, judges might become deeply involved in determining whether Social Security or Medicare checks would be stopped. 
This would be a disaster for senior citizens on fixed incomes who live on Social Security and Medicare from check to check. When they miss a check, they will not have the funds to pay the rent or meet the mortgage, buy groceries, pay their utility bills, heat their homes, pay for medical care or needed pharmaceutical drugs, or meet other expenses. 
That is the dilemma that the Social Security system would face if Social Security is not protected under this proposed constitutional amendment. In his recent letter to Senator Daschle, the President stated: 
I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, could pose grave risks to the Social Security System. In the event of an impasse in which the budget requirements can neither be waived nor met, disbursements or unelected judges could reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. No subsequent implementing legislation could protect Social Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment overrides statutory law. 
The 1983 bipartisan Social Security Commission headed by Alan Greenspan recommended converting the Social Security system from a pure pay-as-you-go program to one that builds up surpluses to pay for the future retirement of the baby boom generation. The Greenspan Commission recommended taking Social Security off budget in order to meet this goal without subjecting the program to the vicissitudes of Federal budgeting for other programs. Congress concurred with the Greenspan Commission's recommendations in passing the Social Security Amendments of 1983. 
Just as families save for their retirements, the Social Security Program currently is building up surpluses while baby boomers are still working in order to be able to afford their retirements in the next century. This proposed constitutional amendment would encourage, even necessitate, Congress, the President, and the courts using Social Security as a way to comply with the amendment. When the trust fund begins to shrink after the year 2020, this proposed constitutional amendment would add pressure on the Government to cut Social Security rather than risk constitutional violation. Instead, we ought to be working on ways to honor our commitments and ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security. 
A recent analysis from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities is telling. It says: 
The Leadership version [of S.J. Res. 1] would be virtually certain to precipitate a massive crisis in Social Security about 20 years from now, even if legislation has been passed in the meantime putting Social Security in long-term actuarial balance. To help pay the benefits of the baby boom generation, the nation would face an excruciating choice at that time between much deeper cuts in Social Security benefits than were needed to make Social Security solvent and a much larger increase in payroll taxes than would otherwise be required. There would be only one other alternative--to finance Social Security deficits in those years not by drawing down the Social Security surplus but by raising other taxes substantially or slashing the rest of government severely. As a result, the government might fail to provide adequately for other basic services, potentially including the national defense. 
Congress can balance the budget while protecting Social Security, but the sponsors of the underlying resolution tabled the Reid, Feinstein and Dorgan amendments. I do want to acknowledge Senator McCain and Senator Specter for voting their conscience on the Reid and Dorgan amendments to protect Social Security. I respect their decisions to buck their party's no-amendments strategy on this point. Their votes not to table these amendments were, I believe, the only times Republicans voted to do anything other than march lock-step with their leadership in support of the original language of Senate Joint Resolution 1.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have stated my disagreement with those who will vote for this. But I also know that many on both sides of the aisle are moved by their conscience in the way they will vote. I hope no one will seek to punish them. I hope they do not seek to punish Members of this body who vote his or her conscience on this matter--I was concerned to see some of the so-called independent expenditure ads over the weekend that seek to do just that--whether they have been Senators on either side of the aisle who express different views today than they might have expressed another time. I assume they have reasons for doing it. 
I have tried throughout this debate for several weeks now to state my reasons. My reasons are based, as my reasons are for all votes, on what is best for the country, what is best for Vermont, what is best for the Constitution. 
None of us owns a seat in this body. Each of us just passes through. Someday I will be gone, just as every other Member now serving in the U.S. Senate will be gone. But when I leave I want to be able to say to my children and my children's children, I did the best I could, and I did those things that prepared you for the future. My children will live most of their lives in the next century. 
As I have said many, many times on this floor, I worry just not for those of us who are here at the twilight of this century, but those who live in the next century and the centuries after, because I expect that this Nation, having gone through all the terrible things that it has in its 200 years, and coming back stronger every single time, will be here long after each of us is a dusty memory. I yield the floor and turn back to my good friend from Utah.

By our Senate oath of office we each commit to `support and defend the Constitution of the United States.' That is our paramount duty and a responsibility that I certainly cherish in this opportunity to represent the people of Vermont here today. 
A constitutional amendment on the budget poses dangers to Vermont and threatens the constitutional principles that have sustained our democratic form of Federal Government over the past 200 years. Separation of powers, checks and balances, and majority rule are not constitutional guarantees to be altered without serious deliberation. 
The real question this year is not whether to reduce the deficit, but by how much and what cuts to make in order to bring the budget into balance. That is the hard work that lies before us. 
As President Clinton declared in his State of the Union Addresses: All we need to balance the budget is for Congress to pass a bill and for his signature. We do not need to change the Constitution of the United States. 
The time and resources devoted to reconsidering a constitutional amendment on the budget merely serve as a distraction from the real task at hand. Let us not be distracted, again, from the true means to deficit reduction: Hard work, hard choices, and bipartisan cooperation with the President. 
Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us reach the level of deficit reduction that has been achieved over the past 4 years. We cannot legislate political courage. We must summon that ingredient from ourselves. 
In addition to being unnecessary, there are six key reasons why adoption of this proposed 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would, in the words of Treasury Secretary Rubin, `be a terrible, terrible mistake.'

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the distinguished manager of the resolution and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The Senator from Utah is a tough opponent and one who I know is committed to and sincerely believes in this proposed amendment to the Constitution. He has certainly done everything that he could and spared no effort to persuade the Senate to pass this proposal. 
As the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to working with him on important legislation and nominations through the remainder of this Congress. 
I want to thank the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle for his leadership on this issue. He helped set the tone of the debate early on, when he articulated the standard that we should apply when considering a proposal to amend the Constitution. 
I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Byrd. I said in my opening statement at our first Judiciary Committee hearing on January 17 that we would be privileged to have Senator Robert C. Byrd with us during this floor debate to instruct all of us on these historic matters. Senator Byrd did not disappoint. Indeed, his challenge to the proponents to explicate their proposal and their failure to do so provided the fulcrum on which this debate has turned. 
I want to commend those Members who had the courage to look behind the title of the proposal and help us focus on its dangers and vagaries. In particular, I thank all those who came forward with such thoughtful amendments. Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, Feingold, Durbin, and Torricelli from the Judiciary Committee, and Senators Boxer, Wellstone, Reid, Bumpers, and Dorgan each offered amendments that raised important issues and added greatly to the debate. 
I want to thank Senators Lautenberg, Sarbanes, Conrad, and Glenn for their contributions and their full participation in this historic debate. 
I commend those cosponsors of the resolution who nonetheless offered amendments, spoke in favor of various amendments, or voted not to table the amendments that were offered. I hope that they will continue to think about the problems that have been raised with the proposed constitutional amendment. 
I want to thank the organizations that have provided invaluable information and insights into this debate. In particular, I would like to thank Charles Loveless and Edwin S. Jayne, of the legislation department at AFSCME, who spearheaded the Coalition on Budget Integrity, and Robert Greenstein and Ellen Nissenbaum, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who spearheaded the Center's research on this proposed constitutional amendment. I also thank Eugene 
Lehrmann for his important testimony on behalf of the American Association for Retired Persons. I commend the 150 organizations that made up the Coalition on Budget Priorities for the hard work of each of their representatives and all of their volunteers. 
I also commend Professors Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, Robert M. Solow of MIT, and James Tobin of Yale University and the 1,060 economists from around the country who came forward with a joint statement to condemn the proposed constitutional amendment. 
Finally, I thank the Senate staff for its dedication and professionalism during the debate on this proposed constitutional amendment: Larry Sein and Jonathan Adelstein from Senator Daschle's staff; James English and Peter Kiefhaber from Senator Byrd's staff; Caroline Chambers and Jeremy Bates from Senator Dorgan's staff; Michael Myers and Melody Barnes from Senator Kennedy's staff; Kevin Cronin from Senator Feinstein's staff; Sumner Slichter and Michael O'Leary from Senator Feingold's staff; Tom Faletti from Senator Durbin's staff; Eric Shuffler from Senator Torricelli's staff; Jim Ryan from Senator Reid's staff; Bill Dauster and Jodi Grant from Senator Lautenberg's staff; and Julie Kehrli and Carlos Angulo from Senator Sarbanes' staff. From Senator Hatch's staff, I would like to thank Manus Cooney, Sharon Prost, Shawn Bentley, Paul Larkin, Larry Block, Steve Tepp, and Troy Dow. I was assisted, in particular, by Ed Pagano and Michael Carrasco. 
As in so much that I do, my counsel Bruce Cohen was indispensable. 
This effort would not have been successful, however, without the attention and efforts of hundreds and thousands of concerned Americans who want to balance the budget while preserving the Constitution and the guarantees that it provides. Their calls and letters made the difference. This is their victory.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I concur with what the majority leader said about being on the floor for the vote. I concur. I think it is an extremely important one. Also, under our unanimous-consent agreement, I will be controlling the time for the Democratic side. A number of Senators on our side have asked for specific carve-outs of time other than what has been set in the unanimous consent. I urge Senators who wish to speak to come to the floor and be prepared to speak. 
I see my distinguished friend from Utah, who will be handling that side. We have all been able to work things out as traffic cops on this, but I hope everyone who wishes to speak will have the opportunity. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the 104th Congress, a bipartisan group of Senators came together to overhaul our country's outdated export rules and bring some sense to our country's encryption policy. We are back at it again in this Congress. I am pleased to introduce with Senator Burns, and others, two encryption bills, the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act [ECPA] and Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era [PRO-CODE] Act. 
This legislation bars government-mandated key recovery, or key escrow encryption, and ensures that all computer users are free to choose any encryption method to protect the privacy of their online communications and computer files. These bills also roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demands of customers--both foreign and domestic--for strong encryption. 
As an avid Internet user myself, I care deeply about protecting individual privacy and encouraging the development of the Internet as a secure and trusted communications medium. As more Americans every year use the Internet and other computer networks to obtain critical medical services, to conduct business, to be entertained and communicate with their friends, maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computer communications both here and abroad has only grown in importance. 
Strong encryption also has an important use as a crime prevention shield, to stop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into private computer files and stealing valuable proprietary information. We should be encouraging the use of strong encryption to prevent certain types of computer and online crime. 
We made progress in the last Congress on encryption. The attention we gave to this issue in classified briefings and public hearings helped the administration recognize the need for reform. In fact, in the waning days of the last Congress, the administration took steps to adopt one element proposed in these bills by transferring export control authority for certain encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The administration also loosened export controls on 56-bit key length encryption--at least for 2 years. Although the administration is moving in the right direction by loosening 
some export controls, its unilateral regulatory reforms are not enough. 
Even under the current regime, popular browser software, such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, may not be exported in the form generally available here, since both software packages use 128-bit encryption. Lotus Notes shareware, which uses 64-bit encryption, cannot be exported in the same version sold domestically. 
We need to loosen export restrictions on encryption products so that American companies are able to export any generally available or mass market encryption products without obtaining Government approval. ECPA would allow our companies to do that. 
We are mindful of the national security and law enforcement concerns that have dictated the administration's policy choices on encryption. Both bills contain important exceptions to restrict encryption exports for military end-uses, or to terrorist designated or embargoed countries, such as Cuba or North Korea. This is not enough to satisfy our national security and law enforcement agencies, who fear that the widespread use of strong encryption will undercut their ability to eavesdrop on terrorists or other criminals, or decipher computer files containing material evidence of a crime. 
Administration officials have made clear that they seek nothing less than a world-wide key recovery encryption scheme in which the U.S. Government is able to obtain decryption assistance to decipher encrypted communications and stored electronic files. I have significant concerns about the administration conditioning the export of 56-bit key encryption on companies moving forward with key recovery encryption systems. In aggressively promoting a global key recovery scheme the administration is ignoring the conclusion of the National Research Council in its thorough CRISIS report issued last year. Specifically, the report warned that `Aggressive government promotion of escrowed encryption is not appropriate at this time.' 
The administration is putting the proverbial cart-before-the-horse by promoting key recovery without having in place privacy safeguards defining how and under what circumstances law enforcement and others may get access to decryption keys. Many users have legitimate concerns about investing in and using key recovery products without clear answers on how the law enforcement here, let alone other countries, including those with bad human rights records or a history of economic espionage, will get access to their keys. 
ECPA provides those answers with clear guidelines on how and when law enforcement and foreign countries may obtain decryption assistance from key holders, who are voluntarily entrusted with decryption keys or have the capability to provide decryption assistance. 
It is time for Congress to take steps to put our national encryption policy on the right course. Both the PRO-CODE bill and the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act reflect a bipartisan effort to reform our nation's cryptography policy in a constructive and positive manner.

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his customary courtesy. Mr. President, someday somebody will sit down and write scholarly articles about this debate. I commend my friend from Utah, who has spent more time on the floor, I believe, than any other Senator. As the amendments have come from this side, it has been easier for me, as the Democratic floor manager, to leave and allow those proposing them to speak. He has stayed here throughout. 
Mr. President, even though my friend from Utah and I have been on opposite sides on this issue, there have been extremely important arguments. Senators can disagree over the question of the three-fifths vote requirement, whether that changes our normal idea of how a legislative body should work, and on the issues of Social Security. Those arguments have been important. Capital budgets have been important. No matter how the final vote comes out--and I suspect it will be voted down--I think that the American public has had the opportunity to hear some aspects of a constitutional amendment debated that, as I have gone back and read various debates, have not come out previously with the same strength and clarity. 
We have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of constitutional amendments proposed every decade. We have, however, amended the Constitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. We are the most powerful democracy history has ever known--in fact, the most powerful country. To be able to be powerful and to be a democracy is an interesting juggling act, especially in a country as diverse and as large as the United States. I think one of the reasons is our Constitution. We have kept it simple, short, and very clear. 
The genius of the Founders of this country is in our Constitution, in our Bill of Rights. But also the genius of it is that Congress, for over 200 years, has, for the most part, resisted the temptation to amend the Constitution. Now, we can, with courage, the men and women in this body and the other body, bring down deficits and balance the budget--with courage. We do not need a constitutional amendment to do it. I urge that we reject this constitutional amendment, having listened and considered the arguments made by both sides. Then we must settle down and dedicate ourselves as Members of the Senate, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Members of the Senate, to get rid of unnecessary expenditures, to make sure that we have a tax code that is fair to all, to bring down the deficits and allow the world's largest and strongest economy to operate as it should. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

We have debated it on the floor of the Senate for the past couple of weeks, which also feels like several years. We have gone back and forth.

Mr. LEAHY. I ask us to think back to 1804 when Thomas Jefferson financed the Louisiana Purchase. He spent, I believe, $15 million at that time, which he had to borrow. Put that $15 million, I say to my friend from New Jersey, in today's dollars and it would amount to $225 billion. He had to borrow the equivalent of $225 billion in 1 year for that transaction. We have not had a deficit as high as $225 billion, I do not think since the last deficit during the Bush administration. In fact, $225 billion exceeds all annual Federal deficits except for those in the last 2 years of the Bush administration. 
I think that we ought to commend Senator Torricelli for the constructive way in which he has acted in this debate. I agree with what the preeminent historian of the Senate, the Senator from West Virginia, said when he spoke of the debates of Clay and others. 
I also agree that this amendment and this debate shows a great deal of thought from the Senator from New Jersey. He was thoughtful and serious during our committee proceedings and debate, as well. He has consistently shown that he has thought hard about and wrestled with this matter. I hope everyone, whether they are for or against his amendment, will listen to his speech. Whether they are for or against this constitutional amendment, I hope everyone will seriously consider the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. The Nation's leading economists all agree that a capital budget is an essential part of the State experience with balanced budget requirements, and that the omission of a capital budget in this proposed constitutional amendment is a major flaw. Over 1,000 economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, noted in a statement of opposition announced by the Senator from West Virginia that you should have this. It is a major flaw in this whole poorly written Senate Joint Resolution 1. Unfortunately, as I have said before, this resolution is one that is written more for a bumper sticker than it is for the Constitution of the United States of America, the greatest Constitution ever. 
I wish the manager, my good friend from Utah, and his cosponsors would abandon their blood oath of not allowing amendments and consider the merits of this suggested amendment. 
All Senators should consider favorably Senator Torricelli's effort to correct dangerous aspects of the underlying proposed constitutional amendment.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act of 1997. This is the President's juvenile justice bill, and I am pleased to introduce it on behalf of the administration. 
Like the Democratic leadership bill, S. 15, the President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Control Act includes important provisions to address the increases in juvenile crime and gang violence that we have seen over the past decade. 
Just as we proposed measures in S. 15 to streamline the procedures for prosecuting violent juveniles, the President's bill would take steps to ensure that serious juvenile offenses are addressed quickly and efficiently by the courts. 
In addition, the President's bill targets many of the same problems we addressed in S. 15, such as increasing the penalties for witness intimidation--a particular problem for prosecutors in gang cases--and improving the rights of the victims of juvenile crime to include restitution, notification of disposition, and greater public access to juvenile proceedings. 
The President's bill also addresses the Federal Government's grant authority in the area of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention. I applaud the President for his reform-minded effort for improving the Federal Government's role in helping State and local authorities prevent juvenile crime and juvenile victimization. I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this issue. It is important that we reach a bipartisan agreement on the role the Federal Government should play in this area as we move forward into the next century. 
Certain sections of the administration's bill differ from S. 15, and I look forward to sorting out this and other differences in the proposals. 
I commend President Clinton and the Department of Justice on their efforts to address the problems of gang and youth violence with the concrete proposals in this bill. I urge my colleagues to put partisan politics aside, to work together on finding constructive solutions to these problems. Our challenge is to resolve any differences in approach in ways that make sense and will work to reduce youth and gang violence. 
As we proceed to meet this challenge, I know we will depend heavily on Senator Biden, our former chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and now the ranking member on the Youth Violence Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. He has worked hard and effectively on these issues in the past and, I thank him in advance for continuing to share his expertise on these important issues.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we should understand what we are voting on. We are about to vote on a resolution to decide when, not whether we release funds, but when. 
Somebody said yesterday that this vote is about an additional $123 million for groups that fund abortion. That is absolutely false. We have appropriated this money. There is no additional money. In fact, we are voting to spend and release $160 million less than we appropriated 2 years ago. So whether or not this resolution passes this afternoon, the funds are going to be spent anyway. It is just a question of when. 
We should also understand that U.S. law, which all of us have supported, says that none of this money can be used to pay for abortions anywhere, and very careful audits have been made of this money, and nobody has shown that a cent of it has ever been used to promote abortion. 
Some say we will have another population funding vote maybe later this week. That is not going to happen. This is the only vote on family planning. Do we vote to release the money now, that is March 1, or July 1? That is all it is. But if we delay, we are using the ultimate arrogance. We are saying we know better than you; you cannot have family planning money. 
Let me tell you what happens when we spend it. In Russia, abortion was routinely used as a method for family planning. In the 4 years since we started family planning programs there, just by increasing the number of contraceptives by 5 percent, the number of abortions fell 800,000. So when we put family planning money into Russia, abortions came down by 800,000. When we withhold family planning money, abortions then go up. We ought to ask ourselves about that. 
The Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, spoke so eloquently on this. Senator Gordon Smith, who is very much a right-to-life Senator, spoke of his opposition to abortion but of his support of family planning. 
We should listen to what is really here. We are just saying, let us stop abortions by voting for family planning.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join as an original sponsor of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights Act of 1997. 
Our State and local law enforcement officers are the backbone of our nation's anticrime, antigang and anti-drug efforts. Together with local prosecutors and an energized public, our local law enforcement officers are responsible for much of the good news we have had over the last few years, as crime rates across the county have declined. The President's community policing program, which is assisting local law enforcement to add 100,000 additional cops on the beat, is paying off. More police officers are patrolling our neighborhoods, towns, cities, and rural areas, and it is helping communities across America. 
On the first day of this Congress, I joined in sponsoring S. 15 with the minority leader and other Democrats. With that bill, we hope to take the next step against crime by redoubling our efforts against youth gangs and drugs. State and local officers are essential participants in these initiatives. 
When I was privileged to serve as state's attorney for Chittenden County, I had the good fortune to work alongside a number of dedicated State and local officers. These public servants literally put their lives on the line each day to protect all of us. Since coming to the Senate, I have tried to do my best to support local law enforcement. Their responsibilities require split-second judgment, dedication, timing, and guts. We hold the men and women who serve in law enforcement to the highest standards because public respect for the law is so critical. 
This legislation is an effort to spell out what the Constitution's guarantee of due process means to law enforcement officers subjected to administrative disciplinary proceedings. It is our hope that these standards will serve the public by helping specify fair, prompt procedures for determining whether a rule relating to an officer's service has been violated. This measure should make unnecessary prolonged litigation challenging whether disciplinary procedures were sufficient to satisfy officers' constitutional rights to due process. These kinds of fair processes should provide the public and law enforcement officers with confidence in both the outcome of such administrative proceedings as well as the fairness of the procedures used to determine questions of possible misconduct. 
When a law enforcement officer engages in wrongdoing, it reflects badly on all law enforcement. No one is harder on those few officers who go bad than fellow law enforcement officers. This bill will do nothing to protect those wrongdoers. Officers under criminal investigation or those subject to immediate suspension because there is probable cause to believe they committed a felony or pose a threat to public safety will find no comfort here. This bill should not affect criminal investigations, nor for that matter, civil lawsuits against officers. 
The procedural protections provided by this bill attach in administrative proceedings. They provide officers with a minimum threshold of due process protection by requiring that the officers be informed of charges against them, have a right to a fair hearing, be allowed representation, be advised of the results of internal investigations and be afforded an opportunity to review and comment on adverse actions. 
I hope that we can make progress on this bill and look forward to working with representatives of State and local government, police chiefs, sheriffs, troopers, and other interested parties as we proceed. As a cosponsor, I will work to improve this bill. For example, I would like to be able to provide greater privacy protection for officers' medical records as well as for the financial information already included in the bill. At the same time, I remain concerned that disciplinary actions be open to the public. When a hearing is justifiably closed, its results should nonetheless be made public. I am confident that we can work out such details in a consensus, bipartisan effort. 
I am convinced that it is worth the effort to reassure those who serve us that we respect their rights and reputations. While no one is above the law, everyone is entitled to be treated fairly.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from North Dakota, and I see the other Senator from North Dakota here about to speak. I will yield immediately to him. 
You know what this debate has shown? The two Senators from North Dakota have been in the forefront in discussing this, as was the senior Senator from West Virginia, in describing his own amendment yesterday, and will be in his discussion in the week coming up. It describes what would seem to be a very simple concept: have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. If you do a poll on this, `Are you in favor of a balanced budget,' everybody says, `Sure, of course we are.' 
Then comes the question: Do we amend the Constitution? It has only been amended 17 times since the Bill of Rights--only 17 times. Now, we have another issue. If we are going to do that, do we do it for something that looks good on a bumper sticker for a slogan, 
or do we do it thinking about what we are doing? 
Just remember, this Senate has only been involved in successful amending of the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of Rights. That means a lot of our predecessors had to think long and hard about thousands of proposals to amend the Constitution, about what would they do. The Senators from North Dakota, the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Nevada, and others who have spoken do us service by saying, `Just what is it we are buying with this? Is it a balanced budget?' No, it is a very, very dangerous monkey wrench in the Constitution that will cost our children and our children's children a great deal. It will cost our Social Security recipients, and it will not do what the President said in the State of the Union Message what can be done: Do you want to balance the budget? All we have to do is vote to do that, and he signs it. It is as simple as that. We don't need to amend the Constitution. 
I am delighted to yield to my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know the distinguished Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] will be here soon, as will the distinguished Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid]. They are involved in another discussion of the issue that is pending in the Chamber. 
Again, I will say, as I said over and over again, we have to separate the difference between a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and a balanced budget. There is nothing to stop us today, this moment, right now, from bringing about a balanced budget. It could be done. It could be done very easily. We could vote for it. The President could sign it. 
A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution means that we amend the Constitution for only 18 times since the Bill of Rights. Now, thousands of amendments have been proposed to the Constitution during that time. The Senate and the House and the States have been wise enough to reject them. Otherwise, had they not, we would have a Constitution about 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 times bigger than it is today. We would not have the bulwark of the most powerful nation known in history. But we also would not have just reflected the passing fancy of the moment, and that is what this is. Not a balanced budget. We can do that. All we need is the courage for it. 
After watching the Reagan administration and the Bush administration and the nearly quadrupling of our national debt as they spoke of having a balanced budget, two administrations that took all the debt of this Nation for 200 years and tripled, quadrupled it in a matter of 12 years, all the time talking about the need for a balanced budget, that was the easy way. Talk about it and increase the deficit. 
What has happened under President Clinton for the first time in my lifetime is that the deficit has come down 4 years in a row. It has meant some very tough votes. Members of the House and Senate have lost their seats in these bodies because of these tough votes. But what they did was the right thing. They left a legacy for their children and their children's children. 
Let us stop the sloganeering. Let us talk about the tough votes. As I recall, in the first two efforts, first two successful efforts to bring down the deficit, most of the people now talking about the need for a balanced budget amendment did not even cast a vote to bring it down. Let us go for reality, not rhetoric. 
I see the distinguished Senator from Nevada and the distinguished Senator from South Carolina in the Chamber, and I will yield the floor, Madam President.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I recall, the tax bill actually lowered taxes for the vast majority of Americans. I can understand some concern for some who may have had it higher, those who serve in this Chamber, because they are in the highest income bracket anyway. They may have felt their taxes go up slightly. But the vast majority of people we represent saw their taxes go down. 
I raise this, however, the fact that without all the rhetoric that we have been hearing for years, rhetoric about balancing the budget at a time when the national debt was tripled in the two previous administrations, we have had a President who has brought down, with very tough votes and very tough action, brought the deficit down 4 years in a row. I would only suggest to my good friend and colleague from Utah, the President laid it out very well in the State of the Union message. He said all that's needed for a balanced budget: We vote it, he signs it. 
The Republicans are in the majority in the Senate. The Republicans are in the majority in the House. All they have to do 
is bring up the various spending bills, entitlement bills or anything else. They should have the votes.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are several people on this side of this issue who will speak, and so I will be brief to retain time for them, and I will yield myself now such time as I need. 
All Senators should understand what this vote is. It is really whether to approve the President's finding. The President's finding is that withholding until July 1 the release of the funds that Congress appropriated last September for international family planning would result in more unwanted pregnancies and abortions and harm programs to protect the health of women and children. 
This is not whether you are for abortions or against abortions, whether you are for family planning or against it. We know in many parts of the world family planning is abortion because we do not have everything from birth control devices to training, so people rely on abortion. What this would do would really give alternatives to it. In a misguided effort by some foes of abortion last year, the funds were held up until now and, if anything, will result in more abortions, not less. 
What I would like to see us do is release the funds for family planning and give people an alternative to abortion as a form of family planning. In fact, 2 weeks ago the House voted by a substantial margin to uphold the President's finding. That meant that Republicans and Democrats voted to uphold the President's finding, and the Senate is going to vote tomorrow. 
Some say that approving the President's finding would result in spending an additional $123 million on abortion. Of course, that is false, totally, patently false. This vote will not change the amount spent on family planning by one dime. And, none of this money can be spent on abortion or to promote abortion. Our law prohibits that. 
This is an extremely important vote, and there should be no confusion about what it is about. So let me first talk about what this is not, so all Senators, no matter on which side of the abortion issue he or she is, will understand why they can support this resolution. This vote is not about how much we are going to spend on international family planning. We already decided that. We decided that, I believe, last September when we passed the foreign aid bill. That bill contained $385 million for family planning, and if we pass this resolution that amount is not going to change at all. If the resolution is defeated, the amount still will not change. So nobody should think we are voting to add or take away money. 
The vote will also not affect how we spend the $385 million. It will not affect, for instance, which family planning organizations receive the funds. So, no matter which way we vote today, we do not determine which groups receive the funds. It does not affect that. Nor will this vote decide in any way, no matter which way we vote, if the funds can be used for abortion or to promote abortion. 
This vote will decide only one thing. All this vote decides is, what date do we start spending the $385 million that we appropriated last year in the last Congress? It does not decide whether to spend it or how to spend it or what to spend it on, only whether we start spending the funds on July 1, 9 months after the start of the fiscal year, or March 1, 5 months after the start of the fiscal year. 
You may ask, what difference does 4 months make, March 1, July 1, so what? If it did not make any difference, we would not even be here. But the difference is, there are tens of millions of people who will not have access to family planning services during those 4 months. We are talking about modern contraceptives, as well as condoms that protect against AIDS. This vote is about whether we should withhold family planning services to couples who desperately want to limit the size of their families or space the births of their children so their children survive past infancy. 
We are not talking about money in a wealthy country like the United States. We are talking about money in the poorest of poor countries. We are talking about money so people might be able to space their children so they do not see, what so many of these countries do, children that die in the first year. In fact, a number of these countries do not even list a birth until the child is several months old, or even years old, because of the high number of infant deaths. 
There is no more effective, practical way to reduce the number of abortions than family planning. I could cite many examples. Here is one. Before 1990, a Russian woman averaged at least three abortions in her lifetime. From 1990 to 1994, with support from USAID, contraceptive use in Russia grew from 19 to about 24 percent. Just that 5-percent increase in the use of contraceptives resulted in a decrease in the number of abortions during that period by 800,000 abortions. 
I would ask, how many of those who opposed that family planning money back during those years because somehow it might be used for abortion, how many of them are willing to stand up and say, `Because we spent it, we stopped 800,000 abortions in one country alone'? That should be the beginning and the end of this 
debate. If you are against abortion--and a number of Senators on this floor have voted for family planning money because, and primarily because, they are opposed to abortion, because they know this provides alternatives to abortion, just as we proved it did in Russia--just that 6 percent increase in contraceptive use cut the number of abortions by 800,000.

Mr. LEAHY. I mention this because Senator Hatfield was ardently, consistently pro-life for all his years here in the Senate. But I also know he is equally passionate about his support for family planning. He fully understood that when you limit access to family planning, the result is more abortions. 
The other side will argue that since a tiny fraction of these funds may go to private organizations that provide abortions in countries like the United States where abortion is legal, the resolution should be defeated. There is no logic in that. What if the tables were turned and I argued that no family planning organization should receive U.S. Government funds unless they do use their own funds for abortion? There would be a big outcry, `It's big Government. How dare you tell these private groups what to do with their money?' That is not a road we want to go down. AID requires every dime to be kept in a separate account. We know how every dime of our money is spent. There has never been any evidence that any of these funds have been used for abortion. If there were, you can be sure we would have heard about it. 
So let us start spending the money that we appropriated 5 months ago so it can do some good. The longer we wait, the more we add to the costs of administering the program, the more damage we cause to the health of women and children, the more unwanted pregnancies and abortions will result. It is that simple. 
I would also say, this has become more of a political argument than an argument based on reality. I do not hear any of the advocates of this position, of withholding this money, stand up and say, `Let's not send any of our foreign aid to any country that may use some of their money, their money in that country, to pay for abortions.' I challenge those who oppose this resolution, if you want to prove that you are really sincere, if you want to prove you are not doing this because of some other agenda, then pass a law that says that no money, none of our foreign aid money, can go to any country that uses any of its money for abortion. That make no more sense than voting against this resolution. 
Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend the senior Senator from Maine for her statement. It demonstrates, as we have said before, that this is not a partisan issue. This is an issue of good sense. Whether people believe that abortion should be legal or whether people believe there should not be abortion, it makes no difference. We should be trying to join together in this to avoid all abortion. If you have family planning, that, to me, is a far greater alternative than using abortion as family planning. 
As we also showed in this, in Russia, where just increasing our foreign aid over a relatively short period of time and increasing the availability of contraceptives by about 5 percent, that cut out 800,000 abortions. I mean, the fact of the matter is, if we hold the money back for family planning, abortions go up. If we release the money for family planning, abortions go down. Holding back the money, just because it may make some feel like they are being a purist on the abortion issue, flies in the face of reality. It is rhetoric over reality. The reality is, spend money for family planning and you reduce abortions. 
I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts. I yield to him.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will take one moment for myself and then yield to the Senator from California. 
I will note for my colleagues that we are here because of an agreement entered into in good faith by Republicans and Democrats, by those who supported the money for family planning and those who opposed it last year. Unfortunately, like in the House, we have a request for another vote because some of the people who made that agreement last year do not now want to live up to it. 
I have spent 22 years in the Senate. If I give my word on something, if I make an agreement on something, I carry it out. I am surprised that there have been some in the other body, and elsewhere, who are not willing to honor the spirit of an agreement made. 
I mention this only because there are aspects to this agreement that I was not happy with, and there are other votes I would have liked to have had. But the agreement was that both sides would have this vote and that would be it. 
When I came here 22 years ago, the distinguished majority leader, Senator Mansfield, and the distinguished Republican leader, Senator Scott, said the same thing to every Member of the Senate: `Whatever you do here, keep your word.' 
Senators I have dealt with on this issue have. I am concerned some in the other body have not, and it is unfortunate. 
I note that contrary to what some on the other side have said this afternoon, this vote is not about the early release of family planning funds. If we approve this resolution, it still means the 
funds are going to be 5 months late. 
It has been said that this vote will provide $123 million more to organizations that fund abortions. That is totally false. This vote will not increase or decrease the amount we appropriated last year at all. 
It is said this vote will increase from $356 million to $385 million the funds for family planning. Yes, but that is a $130 million cut from 2 years ago. 
We also agreed what this vote would be about, and what it would not be about. 
And we heard that this is about funding abortion. Of course not. If anything, the facts show that where we have given money to provide family planning, the number of abortions have gone down, not up, and gone down very substantially, and when we withheld the money for family planning, abortions have gone up. 
I yield to the Senator from California 8 minutes.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, with the exception of a few self-appointed experts who have apparently never been to Beijing, Mexico City or Calcutta, it is widely understood that stabilizing the Earth's population is the foremost challenge of our time. 
This vote is as important as any vote we are going to cast this year. But I do not think we should confuse with something it is not. There are other votes for or against abortion, but as the distinguished Senator from California has said, that is not what this vote is. There seems to be no end to the number of times we will fight the fight on abortion. But that is not what this vote is about, despite what some would try to suggest. 
This vote is about a program that is absolutely crucial if we are going to stabilize the Earth's population in the 21st century. The number of people born in the next decade are going to decide that question. 
A quarter of the Earth's people live in poverty. They have no jobs. They have nothing resembling adequate shelter and medical 
care. They drink from the streams they and their animals bathe in. They live from hand to mouth in filth and in despair. We can do something to help. 
Our family planning program gives those people a chance to get out from under the crushing weight of more and more hungry mouths to feed. Some argue that by giving them that chance, we impose our values on them. The people who make that argument should ask those people, as I have. They should ask them if they feel we are imposing our values on them. What they will hear, as I have, is that there are hundreds of millions of couples who want access to family planning and cannot get it or cannot afford it. They desperately want to be able to decide when to have children and how many to have. They do not see that as us imposing our will on them, but giving them the chance to make their own decisions. Then they will decide. 
The only question is whether they will decide with family planning, or with abortion or by having more children who die in infancy of hunger and disease. If we ask those people if they want to have the technology, and the knowledge, so they can make the choice of when to have children and how many to have, or if they would rather rely on abortion or have more children who will die of disease or hunger, the answer is very simple. They want control over their own lives. And by passing this resolution, as the House did 2 weeks ago, we give those people safe alternatives to abortion now, not 4 months from now when for many of them it will already be too late. 
Madam President, it is the height of arrogance for us to stand on this floor and say, because of a few single-issue groups in the United States, we will not give families in other countries the chance to make the decisions that any one of us could do in our own family or in our children's families because we live in a nation where family planning is readily available and all of us make the kind of income where it is not a problem for us. 
But we stand here and say, so somebody can put a notch on the wall, that they voted politically correctly for which single-issue group or some fundraising letter has gone out, and we turn our backs on millions of people who want our help. 
Again, I would remind my colleagues of the facts in the record here. In 4 years time in Russia, where we made available family planning services, where we increased just one simple thing, the use of contraceptives by just 4 or 5 percent, the number of abortions went down by 800,000. 
But some of the same people stand on the floor of the Senate today and the floor of the House, and say that they are against providing these services because somehow they are following a right-to-life or antiabortion agenda, and they voted against the money that was used in Russia. And that same money helped reduce the number of abortions by 800,000. 
We have Members in this body and the other body who say they have to be so dependent on single-issue groups that they cannot vote for this money. They cannot vote for this money because somebody somewhere in that country, some private organization, might use money of their own, not ours, for abortion, so we should not give them any money for family planning. Fortunately, a majority of the House was wise enough to stand up to the single-issue groups, and vote for this resolution. 
Let us stop the hypocrisy and stop the pandering to single-issue groups. I do not care whether they are to the right or to the left. Let us do what is right. How can we stand here and say, `Oh, we can do this because we're rich and we know better, but, boy, we're going to show you. We can't help you because somewhere somebody will send out newsletters to somebody will say they didn't stick to the agenda that our group asked them to do.' Let us stop the hypocrisy and do what is right; 
and let's vote for this resolution.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is so frustrating. Every year we have this debate, time after time. We have written into our law that not one cent of our money for family planning can be used for abortion, and none of it has been. Yet we hear the argument, `But we can't send money to some private groups because they may use some of their money for abortion.' We do not hear anybody stand on the floor and say we cannot send foreign aid to this or that government because they may use some of their money for abortion. That is never done, nor will it ever be done, nor should it be done. But it points out the illogic of their argument. 
This has become a litmus test vote for some pressure groups in this country. The same pressure groups are wise enough to not to advocate withholding foreign aid from governments that allow legal abortion or that uses their funds for abortion. I am not suggesting that nor have I heard anybody suggest that. However, the hypocrisy is obvious. 
Let us not legislate for single-issue groups, on the right or the left, Democrat or Republican, Conservative or Liberal. Let us instead legislate what is in the best interests of the country. Now, maybe we will offend the right one day and the next day the left, maybe we will offend this single-issue group one day and that single-issue group the next day, maybe we will upset somebody's special-interest newsletter this day and somebody else's the next day. But do you know what, Madam President? In the long run the American people will be far more respectful of the U.S. Senate if we do that. 
On this issue it is very simple. We have already appropriated the money. What we are doing now is withholding the money so that it cannot be spent. As long as it is not spent, instead of people having access to family planning, instead of people being able to make the decision themselves of how many children they will have and when, the number of abortions will start going up again. As we have shown over and over again, when family planning is available, the number of abortions go down, and when family planning withheld, the number of abortions go up. It was that way long before any one of us served in this body. It will be that way long after we leave. 
So we should stop the rhetoric for the fundraising letters, but instead do what is right. We want to help countries determine what they may or may not do on the question of overpopulation, on the use of their own resources, being given not the tools of abortion but the tools of family planning, and tell the special interest groups that say no, that maybe they have gone a bit too far. 
I have nothing but respect for my colleagues who are opposed to abortion. I wish there would never be another abortion in this world. But I am also a realist enough to know that simply withholding family planning money or passing laws does not stop abortion. Giving people alternatives to abortions, modern contraceptives, that does cut down on abortions. 
As I say, I have nothing but the greatest respect for those who have moral opposition to abortion. But we should be realistic. It is like the old days when we passed laws against abortion and the back-room abortionists thrived, as they did in my State. When abortion was legal, people made the choice. 
This is not necessarily directly on point in this debate, but I remember and I remind people who think simply passing a law determines what is a very difficult question for any woman to ask, what happened in my State in days when I was a young prosecutor. I got a call at 3 o'clock one morning to go to our medical center 
where a young woman lay nearly dying, hemorrhaging from an illegal abortion. As part of the investigation I instituted that 3 a.m. in the morning, we found out that a number of women, some college students, had gone to one person in our community to seek abortions. He would arrange illegal abortions for them. Abortions were performed by a man who had learned how to perform abortions while working for the SS at Auschwitz. The women would be sent to Canada, the abortions would be performed. They were basically the darning needle type of abortion, and subsequently he would blackmail these women for money or sex. They had no other place to go. This is where they went. This one young woman nearly died, did not die but ended up sterile as a result. If she had not nearly died, I never would have found out about it. This man would never have been prosecuted. I prosecuted him. As a result of that, we ended up with another case, which I was very proud of, called Leahy versus Beecham, a predecessor to Roe versus Wade, which made clear that abortions within a medical context would be legal. Then the difficult question that any woman would have to make would be her decision, whatever consequences would be hers, not the manipulations of a back-room abortionist. 
In a way, we do almost the same thing here. We say we will withhold safe and legal alternatives to abortion, family planning, because we are against abortion. The abortions will go up. Abortions will go up and people will die. Instead, we should give families, from the largess of the United States, money to plan their families. 
Madam President, I yield back all time on both sides.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think that Senator Dodd has put his finger on a very serious flaw in the language of the proposed constitutional amendment. 
Section 5 of the proposed amendment requires the United States to be engaged in military conflict before a waiver may be obtained. The military conflict must be one that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security. Moreover, the Senate report's section-by-section on this language compounds the problem by indicating that only certain kinds of military conflict may qualify. Only military conflict that involve the actual use of military force may serve as a basis for this waiver. 
I hope that this is not what the authors, sponsors and proponents of this constitutional amendment truly intend. If it is, they are creating constitutional circumstances that make military spending and preparations easier only when military force is actually used and military conflict ensues. Arming to deter aggression would no longer be the preferred course, aiding allies in a conflict rather than dispatching U.S. military forces would no longer be as viable and alternative and rebuilding our military capabilities after a conflict would no longer be possible without a supermajority vote of three-fifths of the Congress. I cannot believe that anyone in the Congress would propose such restrictive measures. 
I have spent much of my time in the Senate working with Republican and Democratic administrations to avoid the actual use of military force. This amendment is written in such a way that it serves to encourage such use. Nothing that would serve to place our men and women in harm's way more quickly or leaves them less well equipped or prepared should garner the support of this Senate. I hope that all Senators will consider favorably Senator Dodd's important amendment. I urge the manager and the sponsors of the resolution to abandon their no-amendments strategy and consider the merits of the Dodd amendment.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there have been a number of articles in various papers over the last couple of years about groups that tried to block Justice Clarence Thomas from speaking at various schools. I abhor this kind of activity. 
Justice Thomas was nominated by the President of the United States, went through his hearing, we had a vote on it up or down, and he was confirmed. That is the major trial that he should have to go through. He has the same rights, first amendment rights, as every one of us to speak. I am proud of the fact I come from a family that made the first amendment a hallmark, in bringing up the three Leahy children. I have been in this body for 22 years, defending the first amendment from attacks from any side, and I am proud of the achievements that has brought about. But I would say that those who try to block anyone from speaking disregard the first amendment. 
McCarthyism of the left is as bad as McCarthyism of the right. If some disagree with what Justice Thomas says, then let them seek their own forum to express that disagreement. Do not block the statements from being made in the first place. That is wrong. We, in this country, ought to understand that those who try to block speech, from the right or from the left, do a disservice to our Constitution, do a disservice to our country, and, most important, they do a disservice to the diversity that makes up the greatest democracy in history. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has done a service to this body, as he has for so many years in so many different issues at so many different times. 
In part of this debate over the last 2 days, I have on more than one occasion urged the proponents of this constitutional amendment to step up to what I call the Byrd challenge. I know the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia knows that I say that most respectfully because when the distinguished Senator from West Virginia lays down a challenge on a constitutional issue, every one of us, Democrats or Republicans, should pay attention because what he is doing is challenging the U.S. Senate to rise above politics, rise above polls of the moment, but to stand up for our Constitution for the ages. Polls come and go. Polls change. The Constitution stands for the ages. 
I think of the vote as the war clouds gathered in Europe before World War II, the vote to extend the draft, I believe it was by one vote. Those who voted to extend the draft cast a very unpopular vote for the most part. Where would democracy be today if they had not had the courage to step beyond the polls of the moment? Look at the Marshall plan. I remember former President Nixon telling me that he remembers 11 percent of the people in this country were in favor of the Marshall plan, but if Harry Truman had not had the courage to push forward and had not Members of this body and the other been willing to stand up, we would not have had the democracy stand where it does today. 
If this great country, the greatest democracy, the most powerful economy, the most powerful Nation in history, hamstrings itself into something in the Constitution where it cannot reflect basic economic realities, those of us who succumb to the passing moments of a poll may regret, and our children may regret, that we did not listen to the Byrd challenge. 
I repeat what I said before many times, the Byrd challenge is here. I ask proponents of this constitutional amendment to focus on the words of this proposed amendment, explain what they mean, explain how this proposed constitutional amendment will work. Senator Byrd has explained this amendment word by word, section by section, phrase by phrase, and what he has done is asked the obvious questions--what does it mean? 
Mr. President, we are in this Chamber, the Chamber that shows respect for silence, for the silence is thundering in response to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, because there has been no response to his question, what do these phrases mean, what do these words mean, what do these sections mean?

Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I close only with this: None of us in this body owns a seat in the U.S. Senate. We are privileged and honored to serve here at the time we are here, and then we go on. But our Constitution does own a place in our country. It has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. We should never rush pell-mell into an amendment to this Constitution without thinking through the consequences. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently learned about a public statement by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture [CPT], concerning the problem of torture in Turkey. The CPT is a respected international organization established in 1989, which visits prisons in countries that have ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. All countries that have ratified the Convention agree to permit these visits, and presumably to pay attention to the Committee's recommendations. 
The CPT publishes public statements only when states party to the Convention refuse to follow its recommendations. The group has only issued public statements on two occasions in its 8 years of existence. Both of these statements, the most recent of which was issued in December, discuss the ongoing problem of torture in Turkey. 
The CPT acknowledges the serious threat of terrorism that Turkey faces and the security and humanitarian crises that have resulted, especially in the southeastern part of the country. The CPT also recognizes that the Government of Turkey has expressed concern about the use of torture and has responded by circulating memoranda and designing human rights programs for its law enforcement officials. However, the CPT concludes that in practice these measures, along with the legal framework to protect detainees from torture and ill-treatment and to discipline those who have used torture, are inadequate and ignored by Turkish authorities. A recent example is the decision by the Turkish Government to reduce to 4 days the length of time a suspect can be held incommunicado, without access to a lawyer. There is ample evidence that torture routinely occurs immediately following arrest. Any period of incommunicado detention is an invitation for these kinds of abuses to continue. 
The facts contained in the CPT's December public statement are very troubling. In a September 1996 visit to prisons in Turkey, the CPT reported:  
A considerable number of persons examined by the delegation's three forensic doctors displayed marks or conditions consistent with their allegations of recent ill-treatment by the police, and in particular of beating of the soles of the feet, blows to the palms of the hands and suspension by the arms. The cases of seven persons . . . must rank among the most flagrant examples of torture encountered by CPT delegations in Turkey. 
As in October 1994, the CPT again found `material evidence of resort to ill-treatment, in particular, an instrument adapted in a way which would facilitate the infliction of electric shocks and equipment which could be used to suspend a person by the arms.' 
Mr. President, this report shows that despite the Turkish Government's efforts in recent years, the practice of torture continues unabated. The latest State Department Country Reports on Human Rights, which was released on January 30, confirms this. It illustrates, once again, that good intentions and training programs, while important, are no substitute for holding people accountable. Only when people who engage in this abhorrent conduct believe they will be punished, will it stop. 
This should concern us all, because Turkey is a valued NATO ally with which we have many shared interests. Turkey is going through a difficult period in its history, and I for one want to see our relationship strengthen. I raise these concerns because I believe that Turkey, and relations between our two countries, would benefit greatly if it were clear that vigorous, effective action were being taken to eradicate this curse. 
I urge the administration and Members of Congress to raise the issue of torture at the highest levels of the Turkish Government, and to work with Turkish officials to pursue aggressively the necessary measures to end the practice of torture and the impunity that persist in Turkey today.

Mr. LEAHY. But I hope no person in the public will be fooled by that. The result is still going to be the same as an up-or-down vote would be. 
Madam President, the Senator from Utah has virtually a blood oath from the Republicans to vote against anything that might try to protect Social Security, children, or anything else in this proposed constitutional amendment. So he would have the votes, I assume, to win. But I hope the American public will not think this is a procedural thing. This is very much a vote on the merits on any motion to table that the Senator from Utah might make to defeat an amendment. 
He does have an absolute right, as any of us do, to move to 
table at some appropriate time. I hope he will allow enough time, of course, for debate, but he does have that right. But the vote on that motion to table should be viewed as if it were a vote on the merits. 
I further ask the distinguished Senator from Utah how much longer he will take.

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I should note a couple things from the debate that my good friend from Utah has stated. He said he is in favor of a balanced budget amendment. I know he has been very sincere about that. My difference is I am in favor of a balanced budget. The two are not necessarily the same. We have been voting closer and closer to a balanced budget each of the last 4 years. 
We have seen, after the enormous increase in deficits and the national debt that grew up with Presidential budgets throughout the 1980's, for actually 12 years, beginning in the early 1980's straight through 1992, where we saw a tripling of the national debt--I do not want to sound partisan, but I point out those were all Republican budgets and Presidents, Republican Presidents who got virtually every single thing they ever asked for. In fact, the only appropriations bill that President Reagan ever vetoed--the only one--was one that did not spend as much money as he wanted. Yet he had, with his budgets, nearly doubled the national debt. The debt had taken 200 years to build up to the point where he became President. Within 8 years he doubled it. It was nearly tripled by the time his successor, another Republican, finished office. 
So we actually built up the debt during that time--we are spending over a half a billion dollars every working day just in interest on that. We would not have a deficit today had there not been so much debt built up during the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
In the last 4 years, under President Clinton, the deficit has come down every single year. No President, Republican or Democrat, has done that in my lifetime. I think he ought to get some credit for it. Now he has submitted another budget that will bring it into balance by the year 2002. 
We have endured a number of gimmicks, from the dumping of thousands of dollars of cash on the ground to even a debt ticker. Now we have this stack of books being represented as the unbalanced budgets of the last 28 years. They are not the budgets for the last 28 fiscal years. Let us make this very clear. The stack of books over there are not the budgets for the last 28 years. They are not the budgets of the United States at all. The stack of books are a mishmash of documents. Some are proposed budgets by past Presidents. Some are proposed appendices of the proposed budgets. Some are simply analyses of the proposed budgets. Actually, the stack is as much a gimmick as a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is a gimmick--as everyone from the Wall Street Journal, on the right, to newspapers like the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post, more to the left, have pointed out. 
In fact, here is a copy of last year's budget resolution. It is a little tiny thin thing. This, incidentally, brought the deficit down for the fourth year in a row. It is not a very picturesque thing. It is not a gimmick. It is actually something we vote on. And by voting on it, we brought the deficit down. 
President Clinton made it very, very clear. All it takes to balance the budget is our votes and his signature; not a constitutional amendment. It also takes some courage on our part. 
Many of us have shown that courage over the last 4 years in bringing down the deficit. I am proud to be one of those. I am proud to be one of those who voted against the economic plan that built up those huge deficits in the first place. Because we are willing to cast specific votes is why I support the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone. 
I share his strong commitment to keeping America's children healthy and strong. He has stated this not just on the floor of this body but in individual talks with Senators. It is a deeply held view on his part. As one who has chosen to protect the lives of those in the next century, I share his view of that. I believe in strong families and a strong family structure in this country. Families prosper only if their children go the bed fed, not when their children go to bed hungry. 
Last Congress, we had this Contract With America--or contract on America. It seems like deja vu all over again. If you read the fine print of that contract, as the Senator from Minnesota has, and the balanced budget plan in there, it repealed the School Lunch Act that provides lunch to 26 million children. The Contract With America legislation repealed the WIC Program, special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children, that provides nutritious foods to 6.9 million women and children. That Contract With America legislation repealed the Food Stamp Program, which is a nutritional safety net, a very modest one for 28 million people. 
Now we beat back the repeal of the School Lunch Act with the help of the Senator from Minnesota. We beat back the repeal of the WIC Program with the help of the Senator from Minnesota and we beat back the repeal of the Food Stamp Program with the help of the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from North Dakota and others who were here on the floor today. We beat them back because people saw what was in the so-called Contract With America. 
But with the balanced budget amendment you do not see how this is going to be done. Nobody wants to bring up the enabling legislation, the details for future Congresses, or most likely for unelected judges to decide. How can we guarantee--I will ask this question of the Senator from Minnesota, is there any way you can guarantee that we would not repeal the School Lunch Act or the WIC Program or the Food Stamp Program without at least some of the protections of your amendment? Is there any way we can be sure we protect them?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
I do support the Durbin amendment. I stated earlier that I wish it would not be tabled, that we would have a straight up-or-down vote, but I think the American public understands what the vote means. 
I was interested in hearing my friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Utah, oppose the Durbin amendment last week by saying the proposed constitutional amendment does not need the flexibility of the Durbin amendment in times of economic crisis because we can build up yearly surpluses to handle tough times. The distinguished chairman said: 
The balanced budget amendment in no way prevents us from running a reasonable surplus which could be used to offset the effects of an economic downturn. This surplus would allow us to use fiscal policy within the balanced budget rule better than we can now without it. 
Not quite so. The constitutional amendment does not have that flexibility. It is very specific as it is written, and it prohibits this use of a rainy day fund. Indeed, those who support it--proponents' own witnesses before the Judiciary Committee over the course of the last two Congresses--pointed this out and suggested the language be amended to provide for such a rainy day fund. The distinguished Senator from Illinois was present at those hearings this year when they were saying just that. 
Fred Bergsten in 1995 and James Miller in 1997, the witnesses brought by the proponents of the constitutional amendment, criticized the language before us for not including the possibility of accumulating surpluses in a rainy day fund. That is what we do to prepare for economic downturns in my own State of Vermont. 
So I hope we might pay attention to the Durbin amendment. I hope we might support it. 
The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, challenged the other side to explain the language in this proposed constitutional amendment to say how it is going to work; what do the words mean; what sections do what? In fact, nobody has taken up the Byrd challenge. I urge the proponents to accept the challenge of Senator Byrd, if they can--I suspect they cannot--and say just what the words mean. 
If you read the words, they say, `Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.' Then they provide for waiver by a three-fifths majority --come on, that is not going to happen. The rainy day fund is out. It would require outlays, specifically, those saved in the rainy day fund, to be expended in a latter year and thereby exceed the total receipts for that fiscal year.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, paralleling the position of the 1,060 economists who banded together to oppose this constitutional amendment, the 150 organizations that make up the Coalition for Budget Integrity argue that the proposed amendment is likely to damage the economy more than strengthen it. They note that the amendment would require spending cuts or tax increases at just the wrong times. They are concerned that the constitutional amendment would likely limit public investments by failing to distinguish public investment from Government spending and failing to allow for a capital budget. They correctly observe that the constitutional amendment would draw the judicial branch into the determination of fiscal and economic policy and undercut the constitutional principle of majority rule with supermajority three-fifths requirements to raise the debt limit and waive the provisions of the amendment. 
Mr. President, I also want to commend the honesty of Jack Kemp, who appeared yesterday on the NBC News television program, `Meet The Press.' 
Jack Kemp was quite honest in his appraisal of the so-called balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Jack Kemp said yesterday on national television: 
I have never been enamored with putting a budget balanced amendment into the Constitution. . . . I would not vote for the Stenholm balanced budget amendment because it clearly is a trap into which, I think, a future Congress would end up keeping taxes high or raising taxes in a recession. . . . It's a recipe for a future disaster for this country. 
Jack Kemp said what I believe many Members of Congress privately believe, but are too afraid to say in public. 
I believe Jack Kemp was right to speak his conscience and I hope more Members of Congress will follow his courageous lead. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

I urge those who do wish to speak to cooperate with the floor leaders, as they have. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have been trying to do this informally--not through an order, but informally--to have one Member speak in favor of the amendment, one Member speak in opposition to the amendment, and go back and forth so the debate will bear relevance to the issue. I hope that all Senators will understand that and will work and cooperate with the two of us to make that possible.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator from Arkansas is still on the floor--and while I indicate a different view than his on the amendment, I, too, join the chairman in complimenting him and the other new Senators who have spoken. When you think back to what your first speech was, it is nice to know it was on a major issue. So I compliment him for that. 
Mr. President, I would note though that it is an important issue. That is why we should take it as serious as possible. We talked about amendments. 
Senator Durbin, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, has also spoken, in one of his first speeches on the floor of the Senate, as eloquently and as completely and as logically and cogently as he used to speak in the other body. The Senator from Illinois has spoken of an amendment that he has offered. While we will not vote on it today, we will eventually vote on it to the balanced budget amendment. He also expressed his concern about the underlying amendment. 
There is nothing inconsistent with saying that one does not want to amend the Constitution of the United States on this issue but will propose an amendment to the constitutional amendment as presented by the distinguished Senator from Utah and others. I think there is nothing inconsistent with this because all of us have a responsibility, however we vote, to try to make what is the final product as good as possible. 
All Senators know that there are issues that come to this floor where we may have made up our mind how we would vote on the underlying piece of legislation, either for or against it, but yet we will be involved in numerous amendments before we get there. 
I have voted against amendments on a bill when I finally voted for the final bill and vice versa. I have had legislation of my own that I have sponsored and have then supported amendments to my own legislation, amendments offered either by myself or other Senators. I have supported amendments to my own legislation offered by Senators from the other side of the aisle on major pieces of legislation on numerous occasions because while I thought I had brought a good piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate, other Senators brought up amendments that I realized, in listening to the debate, made that legislation even better. 
I can think of various times during the years when I was chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, when I would have a farm bill, a major piece of nutrition legislation, and others on the floor--legislation that I had been the principal author of--and Senators on both sides of the aisle, both Republicans and Democrats, had come up with amendments which, after listening to them, I felt that they made the underlying piece of legislation better and voted for them. 
I can think of a couple instances when I have had legislation on the floor where Senators have been very candid and told me they would not vote for my piece of legislation, but on the possibility it might pass they had an amendment which at least in their thought would make it better. It is a very legitimate thing to do. We debated those amendments. Some were accepted, some were not. 
The underlying amendment, the underlying proposed constitutional amendment, is unsound economic policy and should be rejected for that reason. But you also go on the assumption that any piece of legislation may pass. 
It is the responsibility of each of us to offer suggestions, if we have them, of how it may be improved. Senator Durbin's amendment to waive this article in the event of an economic recession or serious economic emergency is right on point, and it does improve the legislation. 
One should listen in that regard to the economic experts. More than 1,000 of the Nation's most respected economists, including at least 11 Nobel laureates, as well as a former chair of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, the current and former Federal Reserve Board Chairman, former Democrat and Republican Directors of the Congressional Budget Office, all agree this amendment is unsound economic policy. 
The distinguished senior Senator from the State of West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] held a news conference in which he released the signatures of more than 1,000 economists and had a number of economists, Professor Tobin and others, who pointed out why they felt this proposed constitutional amendment was bad economic policy. These economists, incidentally, were across the political spectrum. They all agreed that the proposed amendment would hamper the Government's ability to cope with economic downturns. 
Economists and financial experts agree that this proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment will straitjacket the economy in hard times. It will hamstring the adjustment mechanisms that have been developed since the Great Depression to preserve jobs and restore the economy after a downturn. 
Being opposed to the constitutional amendment is an entirely different thing than being opposed to a balanced budget. This Congress, under very strong leadership from President Clinton, has brought the deficit down 4 years in a row and is now going to go for the fifth year in a row. Certainly since I have been old enough to vote, no President, Republican or Democrat, has done that before. The deficit is coming down. 
Were it not for the fact that we were now paying almost half billion dollars a day in interest on the deficits run up in President Reagan and Bush's budgets, we would not even have a deficit today. We would have a surplus, and we could start applying that surplus to the national debt. 
I urge Senators to understand that people like the Senator from Vermont and others who have cast very, very difficult votes, politically unpopular votes to cut programs, to cut spending, to bring down the deficit, do not need to be shown a constitutional amendment that some day in the next century, the next millennium, it might have some effect. We can vote right now. As President Clinton said in his State of the Union Message, all it takes is our vote and his signature to bring down any deficit. We can do it now rather than saying, well, sometime in the next millennium, the year 2000-something, maybe there will be this untried amendment to the Constitution, only the 18th amendment to the Constitution since the Bill of Rights. Instead, we should have the courage to vote to bring the deficit down now. 
Some of us in this Congress and the House and Senate have had the courage for 4 years in a row to cast those votes to bring down the deficit. I wish we were not paying that half billion dollars a day in interest from the doubling and tripling of the national debt during the 1980's. But to President Clinton's credit and the credit of those men and women who have voted with him to bring down the deficit, it is coming down. 
Let us think about the flexibility you do need in difficult times. President Herbert Hoover, who was a great engineer and had many wonderful characteristics, but not a sense of the economy, felt during an early recession in his term that the most important thing he could do to bring about some confidence in this country was to take whatever steps necessary to have a balanced budget--basically taking the steps that would be required by this constitutional amendment. By doing that, it plunged this country into the worst depression it has known in its 200-year history. 
If the economy today takes a downturn and Americans are losing their jobs as happened in the early 1990's, then this proposed 
constitutional amendment makes it more difficult for our Government to respond to the needs of working families. 
As Treasury Secretary Rubin, a man who has proven by his own life that he understands the economy and economics, testified before the Judiciary Committee--and, incidentally, without any expert refuting what he said--Secretary Rubin said he thought `a balanced budget amendment would subject the Nation to unacceptable economic risk in perpetuity. * * * A balanced budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions and recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.' 
To date, no competent, recognized expert has come forward and refuted what Secretary Rubin said. Thus, the 1,060 economists and 11 Nobel laureates who are opposing the proposed constitutional amendment condemn it because the amendment `mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions.' 
I am deeply concerned about the impact the balanced budget amendment will have on jobs for working families in Vermont and across the country during times of recession. If I put a human face on it, I put a human face of 560,000 Vermonters. We are a fiscally conservative State. We find when we sell bonds from Vermont, they sell out virtually immediately because people know how we feel about keeping our books. We do not have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in the Vermont State Constitution. What we have are 180 Vermont legislators who treat every tax dollar as though it were their own. Governors, Republicans and Democrats, felt the same, who realized, however, at such time as Vermont, a small State, has gone into a recession, there are times it has had to spend some money to help us out of it as a responsibility to the people of Vermont. 
I hate to think what might happen if we go into a deep recession and people are being laid off from jobs and are told, `Well, we cannot help out.' There are none of the programs we normally see to ease recessions and get our economy going again. I realize it is 25 below zero in Vermont. I realize you have just been laid off from a job you have had for 15 years, but the various Federal programs that we started after the Great Depression cannot be funded. 
As Secretary Rubin explained, the so-called automatic stabilizers in our economy would be ineffective under this proposed constitutional amendment. These are mechanisms that have been developed over the last 50 years to reduce the extremes of the boom-and-bust cycles. They are intended to prevent another Great Depression. They have proven effective over time. 
Secretary Rubin testified:  
`[W]ithout automatic stabilizers, the Treasury Department has estimated unemployment in 1992 that resulted from the 1990 recession might have hit 9 percent instead of 7.7 percent, which would have been in excess of 1 million jobs lost.' 
Some of these things that helped, when I think about 1988 and 1992, we were adding around 40,000 people a week to the food stamp rolls to help bring us back. In the last 4 years, we have been taking millions back off the food stamp rolls. It shows it can work. 
The preamble to the Constitution and its stated purpose to `promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,' ought not be overridden by a constitutional amendment that denies jobs to hundreds of thousands of working families in hard times. 
People talk about the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reiterated his opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment during questioning by Senator Lautenberg during his testimony before the Senate Budget Committee. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan urged the Senate Budget Committee to continue to eliminate the deficit. He did join Secretary Rubin and our Nation's leading economists in the conclusion that this proposed constitutional amendment places too many constraints on our economy. 
This so-called escape hatch allowing a waiver of its provisions by a supermajority vote of three-fifths of both Houses of Congress is small comfort to America's working families, because many national recessions start out in different regions of the country. For example, the most recent recession hit New England first. 
What if citizens of New England, who have fewer Members of the House of Representatives than other regions of the country, needed help? Or, conversely, what if a very populous region of the country suddenly had a recession? Do they become the only ones who can get help? Could New England get Senators and Representatives from other States, which are still experiencing good times, to waive the constitutional balanced budget requirement to help protect their livelihoods? 
Prof. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, a past president of the American Economic Association, understood the economic problems under this proposed constitutional amendment when he wrote: 
One need only recall the near collapses, in recent years, of the economies in New England, California, and Texas. Who would bail them out if their own tax revenues again decline and there were surges of claims for unemployment benefits, food stamps, and general assistance? 
One of the reasons for having this great Nation of 50 States is so that we can work together to help each other, knowing that if a tornado hits one part of the country and not others, or a recession hits one region and not others, relief would be available. Relief for economic recessions and emergencies has to be flexible. None of us can predict, and certainly cannot write into a constitutional amendment, when the next natural disaster will hit or the next recession will take place, because usually a swift response from the Federal Government is needed to aid State and local relief efforts. Economic emergency relief by constitutional supermajority mandate is a prescription for gridlock, not swift action. 
It would make no sense--if there is a terrible earthquake in California, or awful flooding in the Midwest, or a drought in the Southeast, or a recession in New England--to say we can't do anything to help because we need a supermajority vote. 
When your State or region is hit by a major recession or emergency, do you want critical Federal assistance to hang on the whims of 41 Senators or 175 Representatives? That is all it would take. We have 535 Members of Congress. All 535 Members of those bodies--save a critical 41--could vote and you may not be helped. 
Our Founders rejected this requirement of supermajorities. We should look to their sound reasons for rejecting supermajority requirements before we impose on our most vulnerable citizens a three-fifths supermajority requirement to provide Federal relief from recessions and serious economic emergencies. 
In fact, I urge some to go back and read `The Federalist Papers,' read what our Founders wrote. I hope that all Senators have read them. But if they haven't, now is as good a time as any to add to your education, improve your mind, and acquire a sense of history. It is why Senators, for 200 years, have resisted the temptation to amend the Constitution unnecessarily--17 times since the Bill of Rights, that's all. Surely, we have had more than 17 times in this country when we have had the urge to do it, when it has been politically popular to do it, when we could point to political polls of the moment that said 70 percent of the country wanted us to amend the Constitution. We have taken polling where people have taken our Bill of Rights--those things that protect us from unlawful search and seizure, protect us in our right of free speech and religion--there have been polls and studies done that would just break down the words and ask the people, and the majority would say, oh, no, we could not vote for that. Then they are surprised to find that it is in the Bill of Rights. 
The Constitution should not be a prisoner of that moment's public opinion polls. The Constitution should be protected by the best instincts and the greatest sense of responsibility of every man and woman in the Senate and in the House. If we start voting by popular public opinion poll and not by a sense of history and not by what is best for the next generation, then we fail in our own responsibilities here. 
Mr. President, I grew up in a family that revered the Constitution. I grew up in a family that understood the first amendment. I grew up in a family that knew that so much of what makes us Americans is in the Bill of Rights. In my public life as a prosecutor, as a lawyer and, more important, as a husband and a father, I have realized the advantages I have that no one in any other country has because of the protections in the Constitution. I also realize that those protections came because my predecessors, and all our predecessors in these bodies, resisted the temptation to amend the Constitution every time that it was popular. I hope we will not do it now. 
The sponsors of this measure repeatedly outline the dangers of a budget deficit. We are all in favor of bringing down the deficit, as we have done for the last 4 years. But these sponsors have failed to address how the proposed constitutional amendment will provide for the flexibility needed in economic downturns, without holding working families and hard-hit regions hostage to a supermajority vote. 
Senator Durbin's amendment restores that flexibility by requiring a simple majority vote to respond to economic recessions and emergencies. 
Whether you are for or against this constitutional amendment, we should take the effort to make it a better constitutional amendment. Certainly, Senator Durbin's amendment does that, and it deserves our support. 
Mr. President, I see my friend from Utah on the floor. Maybe he can give us some idea of what he plans to do with our lives for the rest of the day.

Mr. LEAHY. On that point, as the distinguished chairman knows, the new Senator from Nebraska was on the floor yesterday. While he took a different position than mine on this, I commend him for his efforts and his work on this. While the chairman and I disagree on the need for this amendment, I think we both agree that if somebody is to give their first speech in the Senate, there are few issues that will be of such significance as this. 
Anytime one amends the Constitution, something that has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights, that is a significant effort. As I said yesterday, for 200-some-odd years, we have resisted the temptation to amend our Constitution, which is one of the reasons why we are such a powerful democracy and one of 
the reasons why our Constitution has stood the test of time. 
I also note, I think on both sides of the aisle there is strong support to balance the budget, but what I want to remind everybody, as the President said in his State of the Union Address, is all it takes is our vote and his signature to balance the budget without a constitutional amendment. In the last 4 years, the deficit has come down. For the first time since I have been able to vote, the President 4 years in a row brought the deficit down and is now on the fifth time. He deserves a great deal of credit for that.

Mr. LEAHY. I ask the Senator: The Senator is aware, I am sure, that during the first 7 or 8 years of the 1980's the national debt was doubled and tripled; that the administration, then President Reagan's administration and the budget they proposed and received, took all the national debt that this country had built up over 200 years, first doubled it, and then they tripled it.

Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator's point. Would the Senator not also agree with what President Clinton said in the State of the Union Message that we want a balanced budget? The answer is right there in the Chamber where he spoke. We can vote for it, and he can sign it, and we can do that without amending the Constitution. 
The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. 
Is that correct?

Mr. LEAHY. And see if it could be cleared here, too. 
Madam President, last night in his State of the Union Address, the President of the United States spoke of the difference between taking action to balance the Federal budget and the political exercise of considering a constitutional amendment on balancing the budget. I mention this because the American people know there is a big difference between talking about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, a big difference between talking about what you might or might not do, and actually doing it. Here is what President Clinton said. 
Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It does not require us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that would cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results, such as judges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes. 
Listen to what the President said. Balancing the budget requires only the vote of the Congress and his signature. 
This from a President who in the 22 years I have been here is the only President who has brought the deficit down 4 years in a row--the only President who has done that. In fact, if we were not paying the interest on the deficits run up during Presidents Reagan and Bush administrations, we would have a surplus today and not a deficit. 
In fact, I believe he is probably the only President in my lifetime, Republican or Democrat, who has 4 years in a row brought the deficit down and certainly the only one since the last President, a Democrat, who had a surplus. That was President Johnson. Deficits have run since then, and only President Clinton has brought them down four times in a row and is about to submit a budget which will bring the deficits down for the fifth time in a row. 
That is a record which certainly in modern times, certainly the postwar time, no President, Democrat, or Republican, has done and is a marked contrast to the two Republican Presidents who preceded him who tripled the national debt, who took all the debt from 200 years and tripled it in just 12 years. 
So President Clinton is committed to signing a balanced budget that protects America's values, honors our promises to seniors and our veterans and fulfills our responsibilities to the disadvantaged and the young. If this Congress, the 105th, will join him for the good of the Nation and the future, we can, in fact, be the Congress that finally balances the budget. 
Madam President, I would like to be part of that Congress, and I would like to see Democrats and Republicans work together to bring about that kind of a balanced budget. But that would mean each one of us, every man and woman in this body and every man and woman in the other body, will have to stand up and cast votes that are politically unpopular--not a vote that sounds very popular but does not cut a single program and does nothing to balance the budget. 
My good friend from Utah has talked about the public opinion polls that say how popular a balanced budget is. I support a 
balanced budget. I voted for more deficit reduction than most of the Members of this body. But wanting it and voting it can be sometimes two different things. It is easy to stand up, as we all do, in town meetings back home and say we want a balanced budget. It is very difficult to come back and face special interest groups on the right and left and say we are going to cast votes to achieve balance. 
This is not one of those tough votes. This proposed constitutional amendment is unnecessary, it is unwise, it is unsound, and it is dangerous. 
First, it demeans our Constitution. It will destabilize the power among our three branches of Government. That balance of power between our three branches of Government gives this, the greatest and most powerful democracy in history, its greatest protection. It would head us down the road to minority rule and undermine our constitutional democracy. It would likely result in a shifting of burdens, responsibilities and costs to State governments. Whether my own State of Vermont, the State of Maine, the State of Utah, or any other of the 50 States, these State governments are ill-equipped to assume the vast burdens of the Federal Government. 
Both because of what it would do and what it would not accomplish, adoption of this proposed 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would be wrong. Treasury Secretary Rubin testified that the proposed constitutional amendment would `subject the Nation to unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity. It would be a terrible, terrible mistake for this country.' 
Treasury Secretary Rubin commands the highest respect of both Republicans and Democrats and certainly within the financial community, and when he speaks of the unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity we ought to stop and listen to him. We should also listen to the 11 Nobel laureates in economics who joined 1,000 other economists who condemn the proposal as unsound and unnecessary. It is what the Los Angeles Times calls a false political star. 
Now, there are responsible ways to reduce our budget deficit, but focusing our attention on this proposed amendment only delays us from making progress on what are some very tough choices. This is the same old sleight of hand that we have witnessed around here since 1982 when people began voting for a constitutional amendment on the budget rather than to vote to balance the budget. A lot of people stood up to say, `Yes, I voted to amend the Constitution to balance the budget.' 
Hurrah, hurrah, how brave they are, but they cannot quite step up here and vote on these tough issues that actually do balance the budget. There is no magic in the proposed constitutional amendment. The magic is hard work. Reducing the deficit will take hard work, and it will require hard choices. 
Some may even use a `feel good' vote for this proposed amendment as the excuse to sit back and await the ratification process in the States, and then they would sit back and await the consideration of implementing legislation. Then they would sit back and await the consideration of budgets consistent with such implementing legislation. Then maybe, just maybe, they would start making the necessary cuts. 
Madam President, it is like some of the people who stand on the floor of this body or the other body and say that we have to amend the Constitution and have term limits. There are those who stand up and say, `I have been arguing for term limits for 20 years,' some who have been arguing term limits before some of the Members of this body were born, and they will keep on into the next century saying we have to have a constitutional amendment for term limits. 
I heard one Member of the House, who has been here, I think, 14 terms, say, `If I do nothing before I leave here, we are going to get term limits--if it takes me another 14 terms to get term limits.' 
What makes more sense, instead of looking for bumper sticker amendments and bumper sticker politics, is to cast votes that will cut the deficit now. Do not wait until the next century. I want to continue to lower the deficit now, not wait for two more election cycles to pass before balancing the budget sometime after the year 2002, which, incidentally, is the earliest date this amendment could be effective. 
We showed in the last two Congresses we could make progress in undoing the mistakes of the deficits-building decade of the 1980's without having this proposed amendment in the Constitution. For the first time since Harry Truman was President, the deficit has declined 4 years in a row and with the help of President Clinton we have reduced the deficit 63 percent over the last 4 years. 
We have reduced the deficit, as a percentage of our economy, from 4.7 to 1.4 percent. These may seem like just numbers, but what we have done is we have reduced the deficit as a percentage of our economy to the lowest among the world's industrialized countries. Instead of constantly standing up supporting this because it might sound like good politics, let us be honest with the people we represent. We have done better than any industrialized country in the world. 
As part of our efforts we passed legislation that saves tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer-financed Government programs. These are tough votes. For example, the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and I sponsored legislation that reorganized the U.S. Department of Agriculture to become a more efficient and effective agency. The Leahy-Lugar bill passed Congress at the end of 1994. It will result in saving over $3 billion, but it has to close 1,200 USDA field offices including, should anybody ask, a large number of offices in my home State of Vermont. 
What the distinguished Senator from Indiana and I did was not just to talk about it, we actually put together a piece of legislation which means in every single State in this country somebody is going to feel the pain. I know because I got letters from all over the country about it. But we passed it. 
Maybe some of the same people who so eagerly support this constitutional amendment should ask themselves, are they responsible for the huge and unprecedented budget deficits of the Reagan and Bush years? Many are. I am one of only five remaining Senators in this body who voted against the 1981 Reagan budget package that increased defense spending by a huge amount while cutting taxes by a huge amount and which, of course, caused our debt to explode. The 12 years following Reaganomics have left us with over $2.6 trillion in additional debt. 
Do we have a deficit today? Of course we do. If we did not have to pay the interest on the debt run up during President Reagan and President Bush's terms, we would have a surplus today. I commend, again, the President, who, while inheriting a huge national debt, a huge deficit, and a huge debt service when he came into office, has brought the deficit down. President Clinton has, four times in a row, brought the deficit down and is about to do it a fifth time in a row, something that none of us in our lifetime have seen. 
But this proposed constitutional amendment remains now what it was then: political cover for the failed policies of the 1980's and their tragic legacy. Those mistakes continue to cost our country hundreds of millions of dollars every workday in interest on deficits run up during the last two Republican administrations. Think of that--hundreds of millions of dollars every single workday just on interest alone based on the deficits of those years. As I said before, were it not for the interest on this debt, we would have had a balanced budget in each of the last several years. 
The proposed constitutional amendment contains no protection against the Federal Government seeking to balance its budget by shifting costs and burdens to the States. That is the ultimate budget gimmick--pass the buck to the States. The proposed constitutional amendment would be a prescription for disaster, especially for small States that are ill-equipped to handle the extra load. We know what happened in the 1980's; Federal contributions to State and local governments fell sharply, by about a third. During that same decade, my home State of Vermont had to make up the difference. We had to raise the State income tax rate from 23 to 28 percent. In addition, State and local property taxes and taxes of all kinds had to be increased. 
I remember talking to so many people in my State of Vermont, hard-working men and women, people who bring home a weekly paycheck and pay the mortgages, set money aside for their children to go to college. They keep our economy going. I said, `Have you felt these huge tax cuts that we read you have gotten under 
Reaganomics?' Except for a couple of my friends who, frankly, Madam President, make a heck of a lot more money than I do, they had not. In fact, what they had seen, the average person had seen their taxes go up. They saw Social Security taxes go up, they saw their local taxes go up, they saw their State taxes go up to cover the differences. 
That is not the way to cut the Federal deficit. It is the Federal deficit. You do not cut it by simply shifting the burdens to State and local government and telling them to raise the taxes on their people. Working people cannot afford tax increases any more just because they are imposed by State and local authorities and not by the Federal Government. 
While we passed unfunded mandates legislation last Congress, even that legislation offers insufficient protection. My concerns extend beyond new legislation that the lawyers determine include legally binding obligations. I am concerned as well about those programs that respond to the basic needs of individuals. 
Human needs are no less real because they are not set forth in a Federal statute. Hunger, cold, illness, the ills of the aged--these do not need statutory definition to cause suffering. With or without definition, they do cause suffering. If we try to balance the Federal budget by scaling back services, we are just as surely going to be shifting the costs and burdens of these unmet needs, as well as Federal mandates, on State and local governments. 
I know the people of Vermont are not going to let their neighbors go hungry or go without medical care, and I expect people elsewhere will not either. As much as our churches and synagogues and our charities and our communities will contribute, a large part of the problem and a large share of the costs are still going to fall to State and local governments. 
The distinguished majority leader in the other body, Richard Armey, said in 1995 that he did not want to spell out the effects of this constitutional amendment before it is passed because he is afraid that Congress would not vote to pass it if it knew what it would do. He later reinforced his remarks by warning supporters not to reveal where the necessary cuts would be made because knees would buckle. 
If we are going to be asked to consider this constitutional amendment, let us find out what the impact is likely to be. Certainly, before any State is called upon to consider ratification of such a constitutional amendment, we ought to know what the impact is going to be. Every State ought to be able to look at the debate here and our actions here and know what the impact is going to be if they ratify. Each State should be advised of the likely effects on its economy and, in particular, on personal income levels and job losses in that State. Let us get some of the answers. Let us know where we are headed. 
In fact, I believe this proposed constitutional amendment would invite the worst kind of cynical evasion and budget gimmickry. The experience of States that do have balanced budget requirements only bears this out. My State, which has one of the best credit ratings in the country, takes care of its budget without having in its State constitution a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Because we know we have good times and bad times, we have provisions to set aside a rainy day fund. We know that there are things that we have to do in our small State economy at a time of recession to help. 
But look what happens with States with a balanced budget requirement. Many that do achieve compliance do so only with what the former comptroller of New York State calls dubious practices and financial gimmicks. These gimmicks include shifting expenditures to off-budget accounts, postponing payments to school district suppliers, delaying refunds to taxpayers, deferring contributions to pension funds, and selling State assets. The proposed constitutional amendment does not prohibit the Federal Government from using the same and other dubious practices and gimmicks. 
With Congress facing a constitutional mandate, the overwhelming temptation will be to exaggerate estimates of economic growth and tax receipts, underestimate spending, and engage in all kinds of accounting tricks as was done before the honest budgeting efforts of 1993. The result will be that those who do business with the Government may never be certain in what fiscal year the Government will choose to pay up or deliver, and those who rely on tax refunds can certainly expect extended delays from the IRS. 
Passing a constitutional directive that will inevitably encourage evasion is only going to invite public cynicism and scorn, and not just toward the Congress. That, Madam President, does bother me, since we represent one of the three branches of Government. 
What bothers me far more is cynicism toward the Constitution itself. 
None of us in this body owns the seat that we are in. We are all here for 6 years at a time. Some day we will leave, as we should, either by our own choice or because we are given an invitation to do so by the voters of our State. But while we are here, we have a responsibility to the institutions of this country, and certainly to our Constitution, an oath that we each take solemnly and without any reservation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are, in some ways, an unprecedented country. No nation, no democracy has achieved the power that we have. In fact, in history, no country, democracy or otherwise, has had the great economy and the great power of the United States. But no other country has had a constitution like ours, a short constitution, a simple constitution, an understandable constitution. Since the Bill of Rights, it has only been amended 17 times. In one of those cases, it was amended for prohibition and then to repeal prohibition. 
I mention this because I think there is a definite connection between the greatness of the United States, the fact that we maintain our democratic principles and, notwithstanding our enormous power, a respect for Government and a respect for our Constitution based on the knowledge of that Government and that Constitution and not because a dictator and army tell us we have to. 
But that has meant that the men and women who have occupied these seats that we only temporarily occupy, the men and women who have occupied the seats in the other body that were only temporarily occupied, were wise enough--even though there were hundreds and hundreds of proposals over 200 years--were wise enough not to amend the Constitution willy-nilly, especially for those things that can be taken care of legislatively. As the President said last night, it only requires our vote and his signature for a balanced budget, not a constitutional amendment. 
Our predecessors on both sides of the aisle and our predecessors on both sides of the aisle in the other body were wise enough to refrain, no matter how popular it sounded or no matter how much it helped them in their elections, from amending the Constitution willy-nilly, especially for those things they knew they could do legislatively. 
It is one thing to amend the Constitution to limit the terms of Presidents or to set up successions when there is a vacancy in the Vice Presidency or the Presidency itself. Those are of constitutional import. But something we can do simply legislatively, why amend the Constitution? Let's not debase our national charter with a misguided political attempt to curry favor with the American people by this declaration against budget deficits. Let us not make the mistake of other countries and turn our Constitution into a series of hollow promises. 
We are too great a nation for that. We are too great a democracy for that, and the loopholes in Senate Joint Resolution 1 already abound. One need only consult the language of the proposed amendment and majority report for the first sets of exceptions and creative interpretations that will allow Congress to reduce the deficit only so far as Members choose to cast responsible votes. The Judiciary Committee reports that the Congress will have flexibility in implementing the constitutional amendment. It will leave the critical details to implementing legislation. 
This proposed constitutional amendment uses the seemingly straightforward term `fiscal year.' But according to the committee report, this time period can mean whatever a majority in Congress wants it to mean. It has no immutable definition. It may mean one thing this year, and we may decide the next year it means something else. It can be shifted around the calendar as Congress deems appropriate. Watch out for the shifting of fiscal years in order to juggle accounts when elections are approaching. 
This proposed amendment gives congressional leeway to rely on 
estimates to balance the budget, to make temporary self-correcting imbalances and to ignore very small or negligible deficits. But what is temporary? What is self-correcting? What is small? What is negligible? 
With apologies to one of our distinguished predecessors, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Everett Dirksen, a billion here, a billion there; after a while, it does not add up. This is a lawyer's dream. 
What is negligible? We think a billion is negligible, and somebody sues, or a whole lot of people sue. My guess is that unless it becomes a political bone of contention between political parties as we approach an election, we could go a long time without Congress declaring itself in violation of this proposed amendment. 
What happens if the President of the United States says, `Well, here are my estimates. My estimates are we are going to receive x number of dollars and my estimates are we are going to spend x number of dollars,' and it turns out he is wrong? What do we do? Sue him? 
What happens if the Congress does the same thing? We estimate in our budget resolution we are going to receive x number of dollars and spend x number of dollars. What happens if we are wrong? Do all 535 Members go to jail or just those who voted for it? 
This proposed constitutional amendment could be economically ruinous. During a recession, deficits rise because tax receipts go down. But various Government payments, like unemployment insurance, go up. By contrast, the amendment would demand the taxes be raised and spending be cut during a recession or depression. It is almost like when President Herbert Hoover, as we started into a slight recession, said the thing that would give the most confidence to the country would be to force through a balanced budget. He did, and we went through the worst depression in this century. 
As Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testified in the Judiciary Committee, `the balanced budget amendment would turn slowdowns into recessions and recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.' 
Economic policy has to be flexible enough to change with a changing and increasingly global economy. But the requirements of this proposal would tie Congress' hands to address regional, national, and international problems. We should not hamstring the legislative power that is expressly authorized in article I, section 8, of the Constitution. Let us not undo that which our Founders wisely provided: flexibility. 
This proposed constitutional amendment risks seriously undercutting the protection of our constitutional separation of powers. No one has yet convincingly explained how the proposed amendment would work and what role would the President play and what role would the courts play in its implementation and enforcement? 
I can just see the new law school courses all over the country. How do you sue under the constitutional amendment? 
When you put the budget in the Constitution, economic policy would inevitably throw the Nation's fiscal policy into the courts. That is the last place issues of taxing and spending should be decided. Basically what it does is it destroys this delicate balance between the three branches of government: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. 
I cannot understand why Members of Congress want to give up their powers to the judiciary, because the effect of the proposed amendment could be to toss important issues of spending priorities and funding levels to the President or to thousands of lawyers in hundreds of lawsuits in dozens of Federal and State courts. 
If approved, the amendment would have let Congress off the hook by kicking massive responsibilities for how tax dollars are spent to unelected judges and the President. Judge Robert Bork warned of the danger more than a decade ago. Again, Mr. President, why--why--would we give up the constitutional powers we have had for 200 years and give them over to the courts who do not want them and have not asked for them? 
So instead of creating future constitutional questions, let us do the job we were elected to do. Let us remember what the President said last night: You vote it, I sign it; we have a balanced budget. Simple as that. But it means we have to make the tough choices and cast the difficult votes and make progress toward a balanced budget. 
I worry, Mr. President, that perhaps some, because it is a lot easier, just vote for a constitutional amendment which has huge popularity. It is a lot easier to do that than to vote against a whole lot of programs where your vote is not popular. 
It is not popular to actually cast the votes to balance the budget. It is easy to cast the vote for the constitutional amendment. It is sort of like saying, `I will vote today to eliminate cancer.' Who disagrees with that? Or the person says, `I'm against cancer. I don't want to give up smoking, but I'm against cancer.' It is the difficult steps. 
This proposed constitutional amendment undermines the fundamental principle of majority rule by imposing a three-fifths supermajority vote to adopt certain budgets and raise the debt limit. 
Again, has anybody read a history book in this body? Has anybody found out how this country started? Go back to our Founders. Our Founders rejected such supermajority voter requirements on matters that are within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described supermajority requirements as poison. I sometimes wonder if anybody around here even knows who Alexander Hamilton or Thomas Jefferson, George Washington or these people were. 
Hamilton observed that:  
Supermajority requirements serve to destroy the energy of the Government and to substitute the pleasure, caprice or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. 
These supermajority requirements are a recipe for increased gridlock, not more efficient action. If there are some in here who have not read The Federalist Papers, just recall the lessons of the last 2 years when the Government was shut down by a determined minority intent on getting its way. The Nation was pushed to the brink of default when a group pledged that, no matter what, they would not vote on raising the debt limit, they were going to let the Government be shut down. Whether it was political or they went out the wrong door in an airplane or whatever, they shut down the Federal Government. 
That cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. It certainly cost everybody in private enterprise in this area, just about any area in the country, hundreds of millions of dollars more. We looked ridiculous to the rest of the world. But all because a minority made that determination. 
Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic distrust, not just of Congress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion. I have faith in the electorate. I am prepared to keep faith with and in the American people. 
Mr. President, we have also said that `The devil is in the details.' I believe Emerson first said that. The proposed constitutional amendment uses such general terms even its sponsors concede that implementing legislation will be necessary to clarify how it is going to work. 
So we ask, what will the implementing legislation say? Well, we are not going to find out until we see the implementing legislation. Basically this says, `Trust us. Pass this. And we'll tell you afterward what it means.' That is kind of like 
somebody saying, `I'll sell you this business. Would you sign this contract in blank? Give me all your money, but I will fill in the terms afterward.' 
I am a Vermonter. We just do not quite do it that way back home. We trust each other, but we kind of like to see the details. The questions raised by this proposed constitutional amendment still lack satisfactory answers. For example, what programs are going to be off budget? What role will the courts and what role will the President have in executing and enforcing the amendment? How much of our constitutional power do we give up? What is really compliance with the amendment? How much of a deficit may be financed and then carried over to the next year? There are a lot of questions like these that are critical to our understanding of this amendment. And they have not been answered. 
Should Congress be asked to amend the Constitution by signing what amounts to a blank check? I disagree with that. No Congress should be asked to do that. Nor should each State be asked to ratify a pig in a poke. 
In the interest of fair disclosure, Congress should first determine the substance of any implementing legislation as it did in connection with the 18th amendment, the other attempt to draft a substantive behavioral policy into the Constitution. Let us go look at the implementing legislation first. 
In my view, this amendment does not meet the requirements of article V of the Constitution for proposals to the States because it is not constitutionally necessary. It is only with resolve and hard work that we make progress. Neither is evident in the proposed constitutional amendment. 
I have heard some of the speeches about why it would be good politics, popular politics to vote for this. Politics--good, popular or otherwise--have no place when we are dealing with the Constitution of the United States. We inherited a great legacy from those who went before us because they resisted the temptation to play politics and to amend our Constitution willy-nilly. 
As a result, we are the greatest and strongest democracy history has ever known. The bedrock of it is our Constitution, which sets up three branches of Government, with powers that make sure there are checks and balances. This amendment destroys so much of what this country has rested on for over 200 years. 
So instead of a bumper sticker for the Constitution, what we need is the wisdom to ask what programs we must cut, and the courage to explain to the American people that there is no procedural gimmick that can cut the deficit or the debt. There is no nice, easy self-serving item. There is only hard work. But I think the American people would rather have the hard work than have us fool around with our Constitution. 
Yesterday the Wall Street Journal printed an editorial titled `Constitutional boondoggle' in its editorial page. The editorial says:  
We do need to get the national debt declining . . . 
I agree. 
We do need to restrain federal spending. 
Again, Mr. President, I agree. 
We do need to resolve the Medicare crisis . . . 
Mr. President, I agree. 
We do need to look beyond the year 2002. 
Mr. President, I agree. But then they said: 
But these battles have to be fought one by one, and [they] can't be solved by amending the Constitution. 
Once again, Mr. President, I agree. 
The Wall Street Journal editorial concludes: 
The concept embodied in the proposed [constitutional] amendment measures nothing useful; it is at best a distraction, and at worst, causes confusion that makes the right things harder to do, not easier.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, think back again to last night's State of the Union address. The President said all it takes is for us to cast the votes and for me to sign the bill to balance the budget. Many of us who cast those tough votes to cut programs, to bring the deficits down, have faced in the short term the wrath of our constituents but in the long term a realization that we have done the right thing for the country. 
I am proud that I have voted for budgets that have now, 4 years in a row, brought down the deficits, something that has not happened certainly in the last 15 years or so. We have had a President who has had the courage to give us four budgets in a row that bring down the deficits. They have meant tough votes. 
Some Members who voted to bring down the deficit have probably lost elections because of those tough votes. How much better they have been to themselves, to their children and their children's children because they resisted the temptation, as Senators and Representatives have for over 200 years, to amend our Constitution unnecessarily. 
So let us not proceed to a view of short-run popularity but with a vision of our responsibilities to our constituents and the Nation in accordance with our cherished Constitution. 
Mr. President, first and foremost I am going to cast votes on this floor to protect that Constitution, popular or otherwise. I take my oath of office seriously. I appreciate the privilege the people of Vermont have given me to represent them in this body. There is nothing I will ever do in my life that will make me as proud as being in this body representing the people of Vermont. As I have told the people of Vermont in each one of my elections, I will protect the Constitution first and foremost. As I told them in my last two elections, I will vote against this constitutional amendment because it does not protect our country, it demeans the Constitution, and it lets us off the hook from doing the things that we really should do. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not be long because, if nobody else wants to go home, I know that staff who serve in this body probably would like to, including the young pages on both sides of the aisle. They are as important as any contributors to this body. They keep us going. I hope that for all of them their service here will be an experience that they will remember all of their lives as worthwhile. I know that former Senator Pryor, who just recently retired, had been a page and felt that way. I know two of my children were pages--here and in the other body--and feel that way. 
Mr. President, my good friend from Idaho--he is my good friend--spoke eloquently of the stacks of budgets. You know that every year we do have a large document that represents the Federal budget, but I would point out to him that no constitutional amendment is needed to balance those budgets. 
I have great affection for President Reagan. We had a very good personal relationship. I used to kid him that every year he would talk about a need for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and then he would send up a budget that increased our national debt, something he did more than any President in our Nation's history. By the time he got done, he had doubled or tripled the national debt that had taken over 200 years to build up. 
He had wonderful speeches saying, `Let us balance the budget. But, by the way, guys, here is my budget, and guess what is in it? It is one more huge deficit.' 
We talk about charts showing how the deficits went up and they did throughout the 1980's. From President Reagan's election to President Clinton's election, they skyrocketed more than in all the Nation's history put together before those 12 years--more than all the debt that had been arisen from World War II, World War I, the Civil War, the War of 1812, from all of our wars combined, and from all of our depressions and from all of our recessions. In just 12 years, the amount of debt that had grown up was doubled and tripled. 
We talk about the last 28 years. Well, President Clinton is the only President in those 28 years--and now for 4 years in a row--who has brought down the deficit. That is not withstanding the fact that he has to find in our budget several hundred million dollars every day, every single day, just to pay the interest on the debt that was built up during President Reagan's and President Bush's terms. 
I have great affection for President Reagan and President Bush. I felt privileged to think of them as friends. But there is a big difference between the rhetoric and the reality when it came to balancing the budget with them. The debt that the Senator from Idaho so eloquently speaks of, in terms of our children and our children's children, the vast bulk of that debt built up just during those 12 years when some talked the talk but were not willing to walk the walk. And now we have to pay it off. 
In 4 years, President Clinton has submitted budgets and fought hard for them. For 4 years, he has brought the deficit down. No President in my lifetime, Republican or Democrat, has done that. 
This year he is trying to reduce the deficit, again, and achieve a balanced budget agreement for the next several years. 
We talk of amending this Constitution, this little, short Constitution, the greatest Constitution democracy ever had and the reason we are the most powerful democracy known to history. We talk about amending it as if we could, then we all go home and 10 years from now somehow the amendment would magically come into play and the Federal budget would be balanced. President Clinton told us last night that all it takes to balance the budget is our votes, courageous votes, and his signature. We can balance the budget and we can do it now without a constitutional amendment. 
So, instead of amending our Constitution, why not proceed to use our votes. I hold up here the voting lists with the names of all Senators and places marked where they can vote `yea' or `nay.' Every one of us can stand up and vote `yea' or `nay' for a balanced budget. That is all it takes. We do not have to go through and say 10 years from now maybe the States will ratify it and it will be in place and maybe some future Congress will act to make the tough decisions. We can vote right this minute, today, this month, this year and do what we should do--make the tough decisions ourselves. 
There are only five Senators remaining in this body who had the courage to vote against Reaganomics, which tripled the national debt. I am proud to be one of those five. I have cast the tough votes. I have had special-interest groups from the right and the left, from my State and your State and every other State, come and give me heck for voting against their favorite programs. I have probably written as much legislation as anybody here that has cut huge hunks out of the Federal budget, cuts that affected my State as well as others. But that is the way you do it. You do not cast a vote that is just a nice, popular thing that fits the polls of the moment. You cast votes that run the test of time. 
I urge us to be courageous and think of the future. My children are going to live most of their lives in the next century, and when I vote I think of what that next century will be. I do not want them burdened with debt. 
I wish the debt had not gone up as it did during the 1980's. I think it was a great mistake. This body went along with it. I commend the political abilities of President Reagan. He got within one-quarter of 1 percent of every single budget he ever asked for. In fact, when we talk about the veto pen, the only appropriation, or spending bill that President Reagan ever vetoed was one that did not give him as much money as he wanted. He never vetoed a bill because it had too much money. The only spending bill he ever vetoed was one that did not give him all the money he wanted. As I recall, the years when the Democrats were in office, we actually came back with budgets that were smaller than asked for. 
What was, was; what is, is. What is today is the ability, as President Clinton said last night, to vote for and enact a balanced budget. 
Economists are not asking for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Over 1,000 economists signed a letter, including 11 Nobel laureates, saying do not amend the Constitution; it creates far more problems than it solves. What they said was balance the budget, which we can do if we have the courage, but do not amend the Constitution to do it. Even as conservative a newspaper as the Wall Street Journal yesterday had an editorial saying do not vote for this constitutional amendment. Certainly nobody thinks of Alan Greenspan as a profligate, shoot-for-the-Moon kind of spender, and Alan Greenspan said do not pass this constitutional amendment. Secretary Rubin, one of the most trusted and respected Secretaries of the Treasury any administration has had, says do not pass this constitutional amendment. Instead of passing a bumper-sticker form of economics, do what is right. Have the courage to vote for budgets and spending bills that bring about a balanced budget. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the words of Senator Bumpers regarding national forest policy and to welcome Mike Dombeck as Chief of the U.S. Forest Service. The Forest Service is one of the oldest and one of the largest stewards of our public lands. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Organic Act in which Congress laid out the purposes for our national forests. Since the Forest Service was created in 1905, it has grown to manage over 190 million acres of forest lands. These lands span the entire United States, ranging from the small national forests of the East to the multimillion-acre forests of the West. The mission of the Forest Service is to manage all of these forests under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. As Gifford Pinchot, the first Forest Service Chief, declared in 1905, the role of the Forest Service was to achieve `the greatest good for the greatest number in the long run.' This mandate still stands today and should guide us into the next century of national forest management. 
As the Green Mountain National Forest in my State begins review of its forest plan, the Pinchot vision is what I would like to see the Forest Service follow. The challenges facing the Green Mountain in many ways reflect the challenges facing the Forest Service as we move into the next century--increased recreational use, pressure to increase timber production, and protection of the forest's wildlife habitat, streams, and wilderness areas. Over the last decade we have witnessed a boom in recreational use of the Green Mountain, with more than 1.5 million visitors using the forest for skiing, hiking, hunting, snowmobiling, and fishing. All of our national forests together host over 820 million visits a year. 
Although visitor use is a valuable indication of the importance of these national forests, we must not forget the equally compelling reason to protect these national treasures. They represent some of our Nation's most unique ecosystems, from the tropical rainforests in the South, the alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the coastal redwoods of the Pacific coast, and the hardwood forests in the East. This network of forests preserves natural resources for scientific, educational, and historical values. New scientific information and advances in technology have allowed us to improve the management of our forests to protect these values. I applaud Chief Dombeck's call for increased use of available technology, enhanced conservation education, and insistence on personal accountability to protect these natural resources. 
At the same time, the resources available to the Forest Service to move our national forests into the next century must keep pace with the demands. The Forest Service is developing joint business ventures and cooperative agreements with both public and 
private partners to address this situation. It has looked to its neighbors to share in the responsibility and caretaking of the forests. It has reached out to private enterprises to operate facilities and develop viable business ventures to provide quality recreational opportunities while ensuring ecosystem protection. 
In Vermont, the Green Mountain National Forest has worked with numerous volunteer organizations to maintain and develop campgrounds and trails in the forest. The Green Mountain also has been participating in a cooperative effort with the University of Vermont to develop a database of resource information to analyze different management scenarios in the forest. I appreciate Chief Dombeck's recognition of the value of these multipartner projects in reaching out to the communities who live near our national forests. 
Although some people feel that these increasing pressures and sometimes conflicting demands on our national forests is reason to completely overhaul the laws that govern our forests, I believe that these laws are sound. When the National Forest Management Act [NFMA] was drafted in the mid-1970's there was a crisis facing the management of our forest, the competing interests of timber production and forest conservation were colliding. That environment created what I believe is a law that offers the flexibility, public participation, and accountability necessary to guide our national forests into the next century. 
The responsibility of guiding our national forests into the next century lays on the shoulders of both the Chief and the many employees who serve him. The relationship between the Chief, Forest Service employees, and the public will become increasingly important as the demands on the National Forest System continue to grow and diversify. I have great admiration for the traditions and mission of the Forest Service; I have confidence that it has the statutory and administrative ability to maintain the balance between multiple-use and sustained yield management of our forests; I have respect for the knowledge and skills of the people that work for the Forest Service; but, I also have concerns that as the Agency faces the pressure to maintain timber production and expand recreational opportunities we could compromise the debt we owe to our children--conserving these forests for their use and enjoyment. 
As the 14th Chief of the Forest Service, Chief Dombeck will have to lead the Agency through the swirling debate on how to manage our forests for multiple-use while protecting them for future generations. I believe Chief Dombeck has the vision and leadership ability to achieve this goal. I welcome the opportunity to work with him to implement his philosophy of collaborative stewardship and accountability to the public as a whole and to the direct neighbors of the national forests. Chief Dombeck has already laid out some changes to move in this direction. I urge my colleagues in Congress to work with Chief Dombeck to pursue changes that will enable the Forest Service to address the growing demands on our forests. 
I do not see anybody seeking recognition, Mr. President, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate and House will soon vote on the President's finding that withholding disbursement of USAID family planning funds until July 1, 1997, will cause serious damage to the proper functioning of the program. 
It is no surprise that the President reached this conclusion. It is beyond dispute that family planning services, including the provision of modern contraceptives, are the most effective way to prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. The examples that the President cites to support his finding should be read by every Member of Congress. They illustrate the harm these restrictions have already done to the program, and the further harm, measured in the numbers of women who will die from unsafe abortions that could be prevented, and children who will die from disease or starvation because their families could not care for them, as well as in added administrative costs, that a further delay in disbursement will cause. They also refute the flagrantly erroneous claim of the right-to-life lobby, that this vote is about whether or not to provide $123 million to organizations that fund abortion. Not one dime of these funds can be used for abortion, and the vote is only about when, not whether, these funds will be disbursed. 
I will have more to say about this at the time of the vote, but I want to be sure that all Senators saw the editorial from this Saturday's Washington Post, and this Sunday's Post op-ed piece by David Broder, which make compelling arguments for upholding the President's finding. Perhaps most noteworthy is the quote from former Senator Hatfield, who was staunchly pro-life but an equally strong supporter of family planning. He said `it is a proven fact that when contraceptive services are not available to women throughout the world, abortion rates increase.'

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate, with its long hours and demanding schedule is not generally known for the long tenure of its Members' staff. Proctor Jones is an exception to that rule. Proctor has served the Senate for more than 35 years. He has spent 27 of those years working for the Committee on Appropriations, outlasting seven committee chairmen. Nobody knows the ins and outs of the appropriations process, better than Proctor Jones. 
The energy and water appropriations bill just won't be the same without Senator Johnston leading the Democratic members of the subcommittee and Proctor behind the scenes crafting the bill. It is not a coincidence that the energy and water appropriations bill is usually one of the first to be passed by Congress. Proctor's experience on appropriations, combined with Senator Johnston's bargaining skill made them a formidable pair. They will be sorely missed on the Appropriations Committee. I commend Proctor on his long and dedicated service to the Senate and wish him the best of luck.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermonters are rightfully proud of their new chief justice of the Vermont supreme court, Jeffrey L. Amestoy. 
Chief Justice Amestoy--a Republican who left behind a distinguished tenure as Vermont's attorney general when he accepted the nomination to Vermont's highest judicial post by Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat--was administered the oath of office by Governor Dean on January 31 in Montpelier. 
I was one of many who were present as Chief Justice Amestoy delivered the traditional inaugural address in the chamber of the Vermont House of Representatives. It was more than a speech to be heard. It was also a speech to be felt. He offered an illuminating, uplifting, heartfelt, and deeply personal tapestry that deservedly will long be remembered. 
Governor Dean has said, `The most important things in a judge are integrity, compassion, and hard work.' All who know Jeffrey Amestoy and all who heard him speak on that wintry Vermont afternoon know how abundantly those qualities are present in our new chief justice. 
I join all Vermonters in offering congratulations to Chief Justice Amestoy, to Jeff's wife, Susan Lonergan Amestoy, to their three daughters, Katie, Christina, and Nancy, and to Jeff's mother, Diana Wood Amestoy. All were on hand for the stirring ceremony in Montpelier.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is easy for both elected officials and commenters to refer to all knowledge as residing outside the beltway. 
It has been my experience that some of the greatest wealth of knowledge, experience, and ability represented in this country is inside the beltway. Rarely enough does that talent get recognized. 
An exception, is the recognition in the Washington Post of the extraordinary talent of Anne Dibble Jordan. Mrs. Jordan was the cochair of the last Presidential inaugural of the 20th century. 
It is my privilege to know this extraordinary woman and her noted husband, Vernon Jordan. Anne Jordan is one of those people who makes it possible for Washington and our Government to present a face worth seeing by the rest of the world. In fact for those who have come to know her, it is hard to think of anything she could not achieve.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I came to this floor and spoke of an event that happened in the late 1930's in Montpelier, VT, the capital of Vermont, the city where I was born. I will recount that only briefly because we have the state of the Union message tonight. I hope it may be instructive to some. 
In the late 1930's, then-President Franklin Roosevelt visited Vermont. To put this in context, during the Roosevelt landslide, President Roosevelt carried all States but two: the State of Maine and the State of Vermont. We were not a hotbed of Democratic action, Vermont. 
The president of the National Life Insurance Co. of Vermont was standing on State Street. That building was directly across the street from where my family lived. He was standing next to my father, who was probably the lone Democrat in Montpelier. 
President Roosevelt's car went by, and the president of National Life, an ardent, lifelong, fervent, and proud Republican, stood at attention, took his hat off, and held it over his heart as a mark of respect, as did other men on the street. 
My father, who knew him well, chided him a little bit and said, `I never thought I'd see the day you would salute Franklin Roosevelt.' He turned to my father and said, `Howard, I didn't salute Franklin Roosevelt. I saluted the President of the United States.' As a child I remember that same gentleman repeating the story to me in my father's presence. 
I mention this because he was also very proud of the fact that he was one of the ones who, as he said, voted for sanity when he voted for Alf Landon and not Franklin Roosevelt. 
In a way it reflects a different time, but in many ways, a good time. The United States was, in the late 1930's, approaching our eventual entry into World War II, when we had to pull together. We also showed that we respected our institutions. 
Tonight there will be some of us who agree and some of us who disagree with what President Clinton says in the state of the Union message. I hope that in expressing both our agreements and our disagreements we will resolve that there are three great institutions deserving our civil respect in this country: the institution of the Presidency; the institution of the Congress itself, which is demeaned when we do things that harm or degrade it; and the institution of the judiciary. 
This great democracy exists because of the respect of its people for these three institutions. This great democracy is diminished if we, especially we in the Senate, diminish any of these. Debate, yes; but respect our institutions, also, yes. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to Paul Tsongas, one of the most courageous men and of the greatest humanitarians that I have had the honor of serving with in the U.S. Senate. 
Paul Tsongas' work for his fellow man did not start nor stop here in Washington. Before he even dreamed of running for elected office, he donated his time to the Peace Corps, serving in Ethiopia and the West Indies. 
But whether it was Ethiopia or Washington, DC, Paul Tsongas left his mark wherever he went. 
In his hometown of Lowell, MA, one only needs to look at the Lowell National Historical Park to realize what he meant to his fellow citizens of that historical New England town. 
He only served in the Senate for one term. But in just his second year, he led the efforts to pass the Alaska Lands Act of 1980 which has been recognized as one of the most important pieces of conservation legislation in history. 
When diagnosed with lymphoma, he left the Senate to spend more time with his family. But he did not give in to his cancer. He fought it with the tenacity that those of us who knew him would only come to expect. 
After undergoing experimental surgery to beat the cancer, he felt even more compelled to donate his life to helping his fellow citizens. One person he helped was my close friend Bill Gray. Bill, suffering from cancer, was constantly encouraged and cheered by Paul. 
As we all remember, his remarkable run for President as an advocate for a balanced budget in 1992 helped shape America's political agenda. 
After contributing to the campaign in a losing effort, he co-founded the Concord Coalition to advocate a balanced budget. Since then, the deficit has been cut in half and the Concord Coalition has become one of the most well respected bipartisan organizations in Washington. 
Paul Tsongas will be remembered here in Washington and in his hometown of Lowell not only for his work as a legislator but for his work as a father, a husband, and a humanitarian. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Niki, and his daughters Ashley, Katina, and Molly.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to cast my vote today in support of the nomination of Andrew Cuomo for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Given the opportunity to choose a replacement for outgoing Secretary Henry Cisneros, I would be hard pressed to find a better candidate. 
Andrew Cuomo has spent his life helping low-income families find answers to housing problems. His work to combat homelessness in New York and most recently at the Department has helped to take countless needy people off of the streets and put them back on their feet. His innovative continuum of care initiative provided the impetus for Vermont and other States to bring together housing and service providers and develop a comprehensive plan for dealing with homelessness. This approach has ensured that the Department's homelessness programs get the most bang-for-the-buck, and should serve as a model for other Federal programs. 
That Yankee knack for cost cutting will serve him well in his new position. When I look at the funding problems ahead for the section 8 housing program and the uncertain impact of welfare reform on the cost of HUD rental assistance programs, I don't know whether to congratulate Andrew Cuomo on his promotion or offer my sympathies. However, I do know that outgoing Secretary Cisneros is leaving the Department in good hands, and I look forward to working with Secretary Cuomo in the years ahead to address these and other problems facing our Nation's housing programs. 
Andrew Cuomo had nationwide responsibilities which he exercised with great skill. In Vermont we look at the people who turned to him for help in my home city of Burlington. He listened. He helped. Today their life is better because of him.

 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am privileged to join Senator Tom Harkin to introduce the Fair Pay Act. 
Early in the next century, women--for the first time ever--will outnumber men in the U.S. workplace. In 1965, women held 35 percent of all jobs. That has grown to more than 46 percent today. And in a few years, women will make up a majority of the work force. 
Fortunately, there are more business and career opportunities for working women today than 30 years ago. Unlike 1965, Federal, State, and private sector programs now offer women many opportunities to choose their own future. Working women also have opportunities to gain the knowledge and skills to achieve their own economic security. 
But despite these gains, working women still face a unique challenge--achieving pay equity. Women currently earn, on average, 28 percent less than men. That means for every dollar a man earns, a woman earns only 72 cents. Over a lifetime, the average woman will earn $420,000 less than the average man based solely on her sex. This is unacceptable. 
We must correct this gross inequity, and we must correct it now. 
How is this possible with our Federal laws prohibiting discrimination? It is possible because we in Congress have failed to protect one of the most fundamental human rights--the right to be paid fairly for an honest day's work. 
Unfortunately, our laws ignore wage discrimination against women, which continues to fester like a cancer in workplaces across the country. The Fair Pay Act of 1997 would close this legal loophole by prohibiting discrimination based on wages. 
I do not pretend that this act will solve all the problems that women face in the workplace. But it is an essential piece of the puzzle. 
Equal pay for equal work is often a subtle problem that is difficult to combat. And it does not stand alone as an issue that women face in the workplace. It is deeply intertwined with the problem of unequal opportunity. Closing this loophole is not enough if we fail to provide the opportunity for women, regardless of their merit, to reach higher paying positions. 
The Government, by itself, cannot change the attitudes and perceptions of individuals or private businesses in hiring and advancing women, but it can set an example. Certainly, President Clinton has shown great leadership by appointing an unprecedented number of women to his administration. Just last week, Madeleine Albright became the first woman Secretary of State for the United States of America. I am confident she will do a great job, and I look forward to the day when a woman reaching this high an office is not news simply because of her gender. We are moving toward that day, but we are not there yet. 
The private sector also has a long way to go to provide equal opportunity. The report released recently by the Glass Ceiling Commission found that 95 percent of the senior managers of Fortune 1000 industrial and Fortune 500 companies are white males. The Glass Ceiling Commission also found that when there are women in high places, their compensation is lower than white males in similar positions. This wage inequality is the issue we seek to address today. 
For the first time in our country's long history, this bill outlaws discrimination in wages paid to employees in equivalent jobs solely on the basis of a worker's sex. I say it is about time. I commend Senator Harkin for introducing the Fair Pay Act, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of it. 
The Fair Pay Act would remedy gender wage gaps under a balanced approach that takes advantage of the employment expertise of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], while providing flexibility to small employers . In addition, it would safeguard legitimate wage differences caused by a seniority or merit pay system. And the legislation directs the EEOC to provide educational materials and technical assistance to help employers design fair pay policies. 
A few months ago, I was privileged to help organize the first annual Vermont Women's Economic Security Conference in Burlington, VT. At this conference, I heard about the daily triumph of Vermont women succeeding in the workplace, even though many of them are paid below their male counterparts. These woman did not complain. No, they are proud to be earning a living. But they want to be paid fairly, and they should be paid fairly. 
It is a basic issue of fairness to provide equal pay for work of equal value. The Fair Pay Act makes it possible for women to finally achieve this fundamental fairness. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to repeal the Internet censorship law that the 104th Congress hastily passed as part of the new Telecommunications Act. I vigorously opposed the so-called Communications Decency Act, along with Senator Feingold, as unnecessary, unworkable and--most significantly--unconstitutional. 
So far, every court to consider this law has agreed with us that the Communications Decency Act flunks the constitutionality test. Two separate panels of Federal judges in Pennsylvania and New York have determined that the Internet censorship law serves as an unconstitutional ban on constitutionally protected indecent speech between and among adults communicating on-line. The first amendment to our Constitution will not tolerate this level of governmental intrusion into what people say to each other over computer networks. The matter is now before the Supreme Court, which will hear argument on this case in March. 
We will be ready to pass this bill and repeal the Internet censorship law as soon as the Supreme Court acts--as I am confident they will--to strike down the law as unconstitutional. I exhort the Supreme Court to make clear that we do not forfeit our first amendment rights when we go on-line. Only such guidance will stop wrong-headed efforts in Congress and in State legislatures to censor the Internet. 
The first amendment to our Constitution expressly states that `Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.' The CDA flouts that prohibition for the sake of political posturing and in the name of protecting our children. Giving full-force to the first amendment on-line would not be a victory for obscenity or child pornography. This would be a victory for the first amendment and for American technology. 
Let us be emphatically clear that the people at risk of committing a felony under the CDA are not child pornographers, purveyors of obscene materials or child sex molesters. These people can already be prosecuted and should be prosecuted under longstanding Federal criminal laws that prevent the distribution over computer networks of obscene and other pornographic materials harmful to minors, under 18 U.S.C. sections 1465, 2252, and 2423(a); that prohibit the illegal solicitation of a minor by way of a computer network, under 18 U.S.C section 2252; and that bar the illegal luring of a minor into sexual activity through computer conversations, under 18 U.S.C section 2423(b). In fact, we recently passed unanimously a new law that sharply increases penalties for people who commit these crimes. 
There is absolutely no disagreement in the Senate about wanting to protect children from harm. All 100 Senators, no matter where they are from, would agree that obscenity and child pornography should be kept out of the hands of children and that those who sexually exploit children or abuse children should be vigorously prosecuted. As a former prosecutor, I have prosecuted people for abusing children. This is something where there are no political or ideological differences among us. 
But that is not the issue before us. In the heated debate over censoring the Internet, I fear that many Members, who have never used a computer let alone surfed the Internet, may have been under the misapprehension that the Internet is full of sexually explicit material. While such material may be accessible on the Internet, one court estimated that `the percentage of Internet addresses providing sexually explicit content would be well less than one-tenth of 1 percent of such addresses' and that `as much as 30 percent of the sexually explicit material currently available on the Internet originates in foreign countries.' Shea versus Reno, 930 F. Supp. 916, 931, S.D.N.Y. 1996. Banning indecent material from the Internet is like using a meat cleaver to deal with the problems better addressed with a scalpel. 
We all want to protect our children from offensive or indecent online materials. But we must be careful that the means we use to protect our children does not do more harm than good. We can already control the access our children have to indecent material with blocking technologies available for free from some online service providers and for a relatively low cost from software manufacturers. At some point we ought to stop saying the Government is going to make a determination of what we read and see, the Government will determine what our children have or do not have. Let us encourage the technology that empowers parents--not the government--to make choices for about what is best for their children. 
The CDA is a terribly misguided effort to protect children that instead tramples on the free speech rights of all Americans who want to enjoy this medium. The Internet censorship law takes a blunderbuss approach that puts all Internet users at risk of committing a crime. It penalizes with 2-year jail terms and large fines anyone who transmits indecent material to a minor, or displays or posts indecent material in areas where a minor can see it. By criminalizing what is vaguely referred to as `indecent' speech, this law imposes far-reaching new Federal crimes on Americans for exercising their free speech rights on-line and on the Internet. 
What strikes some people as indecent or patently offensive may look very different to other people in another part of the country. Given these differences, a vague ban on 
patently offensive and indecent communications may make us feel good but threatens to drive off the Internet and computer networks an unimaginable amount of valuable political, artistic, scientific, health and other speech. Let me give a couple of examples of what is at risk. 
A university professor would risk prosecution by making available on-line to a freshman literature class excerpts from certain classics, such as Catcher in the Rye or Of Mice and Men, all of which have been challenged in a number of communities as indecent for minors. 
Forwarding to a child an on-line version of Seventeen magazine, which is a frequently challenged school library material, might violate this law, even though children are free to buy the magazine at newsstands. 
An e-mail message from one teenager to another with certain four-letter swear words would violate this law. 
Museums with Web sites will think twice before posting images of classic nude paintings or sculptures showing sexual organs, that are suspect under the new censorship law. 
On-line discussions about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases may be illegal under this new law. No one knows. 
Advertisements that would be perfectly legal in print could subject the advertiser to criminal liability if circulated on-line. 
In short, the Internet censorship law leaves in the hands of the most aggressive prosecutor in the least tolerant community the power to set standards for what every other Internet user may say on-line. 
In bookstores and on library shelves, the protections of the first amendment are clear. The courts are unwavering in the protection of indecent speech. Altering the protections of the first amendment for online communications could cripple this new mode of communication. 
The Internet is an American technology that has swept around the world. As its popularity has grown, so have efforts to censor it in Germany, in China, in Singapore, and other countries. We should be leading the efforts to keep the Internet uncensored, and taking the high ground to champion first amendment freedoms. Instead, however, the Communications Decency Act tramples on the principles of free speech and free flow of information that has fueled the growth of this medium. 
Let us get this new unconstitutional law off the books as soon as possible. This bill would repeal the provisions of Communications Decency Act that result in a ban of constitutionally protected on-line speech, and simply restores the provisions of section 223 of the Communications Act of 1934 in effect before passage of the CDA. 
Mr. President, in the last Congress this body and the other body passed a piece of legislation called the Communications Decency Act. It was done I believe because many felt a concern about what might be seen by children on the Internet. Unfortunately--and I said this at the time on the floor--the bill is overly broad. It stepped into the first amendment in a way that would not have been done with anything else. 
We would not have gone down the road of trampling on the first amendment and say that we would have to close down all magazine stores because they might sell a magazine, which while acceptable to adults might be objectionable to children. We would never say that we would close every library in the country, including the Library of Congress, because it may have books there that while acceptable to all adults might not be acceptable to children. And we would never pass a law to close down a publishing house because it published books that might be acceptable to adults but unacceptable to children. 
But basically that is what we said we would do with the Internet. We said that even though the Internet may be providing something that is acceptable to adults, we would basically close down large segments of it with criminal penalties because it might have something unacceptable to children. 
The first amendment to our Constitution says that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. And what the CDA, or the Communications Decency Act, did was to go way beyond what we believe the first amendment stands for. I do not in any way hold any brief for child pornographers or child abusers. I am one of the few people in this body who have sent child abusers to prison. Whenever I had somebody who was involved in child molestation or abusing when I was the prosecutor, I prosecuted this as a top priority in my office and sought the strongest penalties possible. Everyone, whether parents or grandparents, would do everything possible to stop anybody from abusing our children. As parents, we would take the responsibility to make sure that our children are protected from offensive or indecent material, whether it is online, or the Internet, or elsewhere. 
But, unfortunately, no matter what every single one of us feel, Republicans or Democrats, or no matter where we are from, the CDA is a terribly misguided effort to protect children that instead tramples on the free speech of all Americans who want to use the Internet. It takes a blunderbuss approach. It puts all Internet users at risk of committing a crime. It penalizes by a 2-year jail term and large fines anyone who transmits indecent material to a minor, or places or posts indecent material in areas where a minor might see it--not whether they do or not but they might. 
What this means is a university professor risks prosecution by making available online to a freshman literature class excerpts from Catcher in the Rye, or Of Mice and Men--all of which have been challenged in communities as indecent for minors. Or forwarding to a child online a version of Seventeen magazine might violate the law, even though any child could buy that magazine freely at a newsstand. E-mail messages from one teenager to another using some four-letter words violates the law. Museums for web sites are going to think twice before posting images of something like Michelangelo's David because showing sexual organs would be specifically excluded under this law. Online discussions about sexually transmitted diseases could be illegal. Advertisements that would be illegal in print could be illegal here. 
So it is because of that, because it went so far, that the courts have looked at this and have unanimously struck it down. They have said that it is unconstitutional. Multijudge panels in Philadelphia and New York City came unanimously to that view, and it is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Experts from the right to the left that I have spoken with on 
constitutional law predict that the Supreme Court will uphold the unanimous decision of the lower Federal court and find it unconstitutional. 
So I am going to introduce a bill to repeal the Internet censorship parts of the Communications Decency Act, and I will do this along with Senator Feingold because the law is unnecessary, unworkable, and, most significantly, unconstitutional. There are better ways of doing this. Let us work with computer software producers on programs that can screen out material which parents find offensive and allow a parent to know where a child has gone on the Internet and allow parents to make this decision--just as when my children were growing up before the Internet, I would say, `I know you can go to such and such a bookstore and buy this or that magazine but your mother and I prefer you do not. And let us instead give you some ideas of better things to read,' and work with them. 
Technology will allow parents to do that. It will allow them to block out offensive material. But perhaps more importantly when their children become computer literate--something that those of our age may not be able to do--allow parents to work with their children and find out how the Internet works and find out about the tremendous things available from the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, the Vatican museum, the sports pages, computer games, information from major magazines and writers--and things that are sometimes junkie and frivolous but harmless nonetheless. 
That is what we should do and not be in the position of putting the heavy hand of Government censorship on something that is so quintessentially American as the Internet, which has shown the genius of what we are able to do in this country and how we are able now to bring it to all other countries around the world. This happened because--and very specifically because--the Government stepped out of the picture and allowed the genius of individuals to do it. That means, just like the publishing of newspapers, magazines and everything else, that you get a certain amount of junk that gets in there. Most of us can pretty well decide what is junk and what is not. We discard that, and we go on to the best. We can do this. 
So I summit, Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Jeffords, legislation as I said, to repeal the Internet censorship provisions of the Communications Decency Act, and simply restore the law in effect before we banned constitutionally protected on-line speech. I ask unanimous consent that it be appropriately referred.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of William Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. After watching the Armed Services Committee hearings on his nomination I am not sure whether the Senate is voting in confirmation or coronation of my friend from Maine. 
I can certainly understand how the committee provided such overwhelming support for this nomination. I have enjoyed working with Bill Cohen on a wide range of issues. He and I have served together on the Intelligence Committee and we have traveled together on arms control delegations. I am gratified by the support he has lent to efforts I have brought before the Senate to limit the export and use of land mines. He has that unique New England philosophy, increasingly rare these days, of working in a bipartisan fashion to build support for legislative initiatives for the good of the country. There will be a void in the Senate without him but the nation is fortunate to have his leadership on defense issues. 
There are two distinct qualities about Bill Cohen that I am confident will serve him well as Secretary of Defense. As all of us who have had the honor to serve with him know, Bill Cohen is his own individual. He is not afraid to stand up for what he believes is best for the Nation. He also possesses one of the most formidable intellects that I have worked with in my 22 years in the Senate. I know that these qualities will serve him well as he guides the Department of Defense and advises the President in the coming years.

Mr. LEAHY. I just have heard so much, Mr. President, about a desire to return to less partisanship and more comity at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. I hope that might happen for the sake of this country. 
I go back to an experience my father used to tell me about when I was a child. It was in 1936. I was not yet alive. But my father was born, raised in Vermont. At that time it was probably the most Republican State in the Union, one of only two States, for example, that voted for Alf Landon in the Franklin Roosevelt landslide. 
President Franklin Roosevelt came to Vermont in 1936, actually August 1, 1936. He went in an open car down State Street in Montpelier. The National Life Insurance Building had its headquarters at that time there. My family had their home almost across the street where they had the Leahy Press. My father, who was probably the only Democrat in Montpelier at the time, was standing in front of the National Life Building. 
You must understand, National Life was sort of an adjunct to the Republican Party. They would determine, along with a couple other companies, who would be Governor this year to the next year and the next year at a time when we were solely a one-party State. I must say, as a Democrat I will have to admit they came up with some pretty good Governors too, but very, very much a Republican hierarchy place. 
As the car went by, the President of the National Life took off his hat, stood at attention holding it over his heart. My father, standing next to him, said, `I never thought I'd see the day that you would take off your hat to Franklin Roosevelt.' 
He turned to my father and said, `Howard, I didn't take off my hat to Franklin Roosevelt. I took off my hat for the President of the United States of America.' My father told me that story so many times growing up, and I had met the man who did that and I knew the facts of it. I recounted the story to a number of people, people writing books or speaking on this, as an example of a different era. Now, this man would never have voted for Franklin Roosevelt. He would have supported whoever ran against him, but he respected the office of the Presidency, as he respected the office of the Congress. 
I hope, Mr. President, that all of us who serve in the Congress, in both parties, would stop trying to figure out how best to tear down these institutions. We are the most powerful democracy history has ever known. We are the only superpower in the world today. That brings with it certain responsibilities--to stay both a democracy and so powerful a country. We did it because of the genius of our three-part Government--the executive branch, legislative branch, and the judicial branch. 
In recent years, with both Democrat and Republican Presidents, it has become a sport in this Nation to find every conceivable way to tear them down no matter what they do. I would ask myself and the public, is it conceivable that any person, man or woman, Democrat or Republican, could ever, anywhere in this Nation of 260 million people, reach the level of virtue and be the paragon that we seem to insist our President should be? If so, then that person is not a representative of 260 million Americans. But we try every which way to diminish the power of the Presidency, the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. In the Senate and in the House we do it to ourselves, so that, again, the respect of the Nation is diminished. Now we see more and more attempts to do it to the judiciary. 
Mr. President, let us stop and think. If we destroy, either by our actions or others', the respect that these institutions of Government must have, how long do we remain a democracy and how long before the checks and balances that have been so carefully built up, and built up based on the trust of the American people, how long before that trust is destroyed, the checks and balances fail, and suddenly you have an opening for a person on horseback to come in and take over the reins of power of the last great nuclear superpower, with the largest economy in the world, the most powerful nation on Earth, a nation that can justify its power and its position in this world only if it remains a democracy, only if it represents its own people, only if the reins of power maintain the respect of the people. 
So I go back to that August day in Montpelier, VT, when that man was holding his hat over his heart as President Roosevelt went by, and as my father, a loyal long-time Democrat, may God rest his soul, took his hat off and held it over his heart when President Eisenhower honored the State of Vermont and drove through, and as I did, as a young prosecutor, for President Johnson and President Nixon and President Bush and President Clinton, stand at attention, thinking how honored our State was that they came and brought with them the symbols of the office of the Presidency. 
Let us try. It is difficult in the time of the 30-second sound bites and special interest groups on the right and left. It is difficult when partisan feelings run high. But let us step back and say: Respect this country; respect the institutions; respect the integrity and the independence of our judiciary; respect the good will and patriotism of the men and women who have the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives; respect the fact that we, as a Nation, elect our President, a President who constitutionally can serve only 4 years at a time and no more than 8; respect the fact that we have those checks and balances. Maybe we ought to work at making Government work and earn the respect of our people and not try in so many ways to tear Government apart. 
Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Iowa for his courtesy, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are few jobs on Earth more demanding, or where the stakes are greater, than the Secretary of State of the United States. The daily business of most heads of state around the world pales in comparison. 
The President has made an outstanding nomination. Madeleine Albright brings to this job a lifetime of experience. She has proven her toughness and her fairness many times over. She has been an unwavering champion of the fundamental ideals our Nation stands for. 
She has been a strong voice for international human rights and the dignity of all people. She is going to be looked at by millions of people all over the world--in democracies and countries that are not democratic--as our voice in foreign affairs. 
My wife Marcelle and I have been privileged to know Madeleine Albright for over 20 years. We have traveled with her and we have worked with her. I also had the privilege to be appointed as a congressional delegate to the United Nations, when I joined with her in introducing resolutions on landmines. I have always found her to be a person of the highest integrity, the greatest ability, wide-ranging knowledge, and one real tough ambassador when she has to be, to protect the interests of the United States. 
On an issue dear to my heart, the abolition of antipersonnel landmines, we could not ask for a more forceful or passionate advocate for an international ban. Her trip to Angola last year and her poignant descriptions of what she saw there gave a great boost to the effort to ban landmines not only in this country, but worldwide. 
The recent United Nations vote, with 156 nations in favor and none opposed, for a U.S. resolution calling for urgent negotiations on a treaty to ban antipersonnel mines, was made possible in no small part because of Madeleine Albright's active role.

Mr. LEAHY. As Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright and I will have many conversations on a wide range of foreign policy issues. I know Secretaries have traditionally steered clear of budgetary issues. As the budget for foreign assistance has fallen sharply in recent years, I hope she will become more directly involved in reversing this dangerous trend. Secretary Christopher called the decline in funding for foreign assistance `the biggest crisis we are facing in foreign policy today.' Not Bosnia. Not the Middle East. Not the fate of democracy in Russia. Not North Korea. Not renewed violence in Northern Ireland. 
Not the simmering conflict between India and Pakistan--both nuclear powers. Not the danger of plutonium ending up in the hands of terrorists. Not war and hunger in Africa. 
No, all of those things. Because we cannot deal with these problems unless we are willing to pay the price. Leadership costs money. Ambassador Albright knows that. 
I believe she will make the foreign policy budget a high priority and keep it at the top of the agenda. There have already been a number of Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, who have said strongly and forcefully--respected voices in this Chamber--that they will work to ensure that the administration has the funding necessary to effectively carry out its foreign policy. We need her active and sustained support in this. 
She is going to have her plate full. I urge her to give special attention to the needs of our own hemisphere, and I know that she will. We have seen real progress toward democracy and free markets in Latin America, but the future is far from certain. 
We have a compelling interest in stopping the flow of drugs and refugees, in strengthening civilian governments and seeing human rights respected in places where they are not, and in broadening our trade relations. I know of nobody who would give a better voice to that. 
So I think Madeleine Albright was a superb choice. She will make us all proud, as she already has as our representative to the United Nations. And I think the fact that we are hearing such strong voices on both sides of the aisle commending this choice bodes well for her as Secretary of State, and for all Americans. She will be confirmed overwhelmingly. 
It truly is the American dream when the daughter of a Czechoslovakian escaping communism becomes America's Ambassador to the United Nations, and the Secretary of State of this great Nation. 
Mr. President, again, I thank my dear friend from Iowa for his customary courtesy, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Daschle and other Democratic Senators in introducing S. 15, the Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act. 
Unfortunately, we need to look no further than today's headlines to see how badly we need this legislation. Over the past week, the chilling story has unfolded about Darryl Hall, a 12-year-old boy violently abducted on his way home from school in our Nation's Capital and then found dead and frozen with a gunshot to the back of his head. Three youths have been arrested, and the police suspect this heinous crime was the work of a gang. We must put a stop to the brutality of children killing children. 
We all want to protect the children of this country from becoming victims of crime, from joining gangs, and from becoming drug addicts. This is not a partisan issue. Gang members do not ask their new recruits whether they are Republican or Democrat. Criminals do not ask before they strike whether their victim is Republican or Democrat. We in Congress need to make every effort to work together to get a handle on this problem. 
The Democratic crime initiative we are introducing today builds on and continues the proven elements of the 1994 crime bill and takes the next steps to confront the problems of youth crime, drug abuse and gang violence. Our bill targets youthful offenders for certain punishment when they commit violent acts and offers helpful treatment when they need it. Although the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes dipped in 1995, these numbers remain at unacceptable levels: sixty-four percent more juveniles were arrested for violent crimes in 1995 than in 1987. 
Concern about the spread of gangs--the violence, the drug dealing and other criminal activity that gangs leave in their wake--has spread from our large cities to rural American towns. Indeed, one of the major factors responsible for the increases in juvenile crime over the past decade is the growth of criminal street gangs across this country. Although places such as Los Angeles or New York City first spring to mind when the word `gang' is mentioned, gangs are spreading across State boundaries and are problems today in many rural areas, as well as in urban centers. 
In my days as a prosecutor, gangs were unheard of in Vermont. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Just last month, the Vermont Corrections Commissioner reported significant increases in gang activity occurring in Vermont's prisons. There are also reports that franchises of the `los solidos' gang have set up shop in Rutland, and the `la familia' gang has moved into St. Johnsbury. 
Gangs violate the law, corrupt our youth, and disturb the tranquility of our streets. They are a problem we all now face, and they are a driving force in the crime wave which this Congress and the Federal Government must address, in partnership with our States and communities and with law enforcement authorities at all levels. 
What do we propose to do about it? First, we hope to work constructively with our colleagues from the other side of the aisle to deal with the problems of gangs and youth violence. We were able to do that in 1994. Senator Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, worked tirelessly to ensure passage of the 1994 crime law. The Democratic youth violence bill we introduce today has been crafted under the leadership of Senator Daschle and reflects the contributions of Senators Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Kennedy, and others. 
This Democratic leadership bill builds on the successes of the 1994 crime law, which is putting 100,000 cops on our Nation's streets and increased prevention and intervention efforts to keep children safe from crime and drugs. Specifically, our bill will: 
Expand the community oriented policing [cops] program to put 25,000 more cops on the beat; 
Continue the Violence Against Women Act by providing $600 million to prosecute batterers, shelter 400,000 battered women and their children and continue the national domestic violence hotline; and 
Provide $5 billion to build prisons so that States requiring serious violent offenders to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences will be better able to house criminals. 
The Democratic crime bill also looks to the future with new laws and programs to crack down on violent youth and gang violence. These measures target the use of `gang paraphernalia', the spread of gang `franchises', the intimidation of witnesses, and reform of the juvenile justice system, with more protection for the victims of juvenile crime. 
Specifically, our bill would increase the penalties for illegally using `gang paraphernalia' such as body armor and laser sighting devices. Police officers use kevlar vests to protect their lives and hence our public safety. When criminals use kevlar vests, they do so to ensure their escape and enjoy the fruits of their crime. Under this bill, they would get more time when they are caught using such body armor in the commission of a crime. 
The bill also makes it easier for law enforcement to use clone beepers to investigate gang activity. Beepers are how gang members and drug dealers keep in touch with each other. One tool law enforcement uses to investigate these criminals is a `clone beeper', which displays the same numbers displayed on the beepers of targeted criminals. This bill will permit law enforcement to get a clone beeper with the same kind of court order they already use to get information on the numbers dialed to or from a telephone. This is not to be confused with wiretap order to eavesdrop on what people say; clone beepers only give information on the numbers displayed on the beeper. The bill will speed up the process for law enforcement to get `clone beepers.' 
Our bill would double the penalty for using physical violence or threatening physical violence against witnesses, victims or informants. Nothing undermines our system of justice more than scaring people away from providing information that helps the police, prosecutors, judges and juries from finding the truth. 
The bill would create a new federal crime for expanding gangs across State borders and increase penalties for using firearms to commit drug trafficking crimes and crimes of violence. 
We also propose several needed changes in the juvenile justice system to respond to the need to crack down on violent youth with the full force of the law. This means increasing the incarceration periods for juvenile offenders so that they may be incarcerated until the age of 26 instead of mandatory release at the age of 21, streamlining procedures for prosecuting violent juveniles as adults, and building more prisons to incarcerate juvenile offenders. In addition, our bill creates new juvenile gun and drug courts to speed prosecution and sentencing for drug abuse and weapons violations. 
The bill also improves the rights of victims of violent juvenile crime. Whether the perpetrator of a violent crime is an adult or a juvenile, the victim should have the opportunity to speak to the sentencing judge and be entitled to restitution. 
Drugs have had a devastating affect on our society. It is clear that no solution to the juvenile crime problem will work if it does not address the role that drug abuse and drug trafficking play in creating unsafe environments for our children. For this reason, the Democratic crime bill includes measures to prevent and treat youth drug addiction. These measures include: 
Providing $200 million investment in research and development of medicines to treat heroin and cocaine addiction; and 
Extending the drug courts program to force more than 500,000 adult and juvenile drug offenders to engage in a rigorous drug testing and drug treatment--or face certain imprisonment. 
We also protect children from becoming the victims of crime, with programs that would keep children like Darryl Hall in safer environments. These measures include: 
Extending the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program; and 
Creating after-school `safe havens' where children are protected from drugs, gangs and crime in supervised and productive environments. 
In Vermont, we have a very successful program called `Kids 'N Kops' that brings school-age children and our law enforcement officers together in a fun and constructive way. Last spring, the attorney general attended an annual event in Vermont celebrating this program and urged that the program be replicated elsewhere in the country. This bill would help make that a reality. 
Youth crime has many causes, and no one bill can solve them all. But that should not paralyze us from taking sensible steps, in partnership with states and communities of all sizes and in all regions of the Nation, to begin turning the tables on youth crime and drug abuse. This bill proposes a balanced approach combining strong, targeted law enforcement measures with the prevention efforts that law enforcement officers on the front lines tell us are necessary to make a dent in the problem. 
In the final stages, the 1994 crime bill was passed over vigorous partisan obstacles and objections, and crime bills often spark some of our most partisan debates. But this time, we truly have the opportunity to pass a bipartisan bill with the active support of a president who is making youth crime prevention a priority in his second term and who supports the thrust of what we are proposing in this package. We have come forward with balanced, common-sense solutions to youth crime. We should debate and refine this bill as we go along, but these are not suggestions that should divide us along party lines. 
We look forward to working with the administration, our Republican colleagues and the Department of Justice--which has demonstrated its ability to move effectively in implementing anti-crime initiatives--in bringing these proposals to Congress' front burner for debate and prompt action.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join today in introducing the Curt Flood Act of 1997. Like the earlier version of this legislation that I sponsored in the last Congress, this bill is intended to cut back on the unjustified, judicially created exemption from the antitrust laws. In my view no one is or should be above the law. 
Last Congress for the first time in our history, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported language designed to cut back baseball's judicially mandated and aberrational antitrust exemption. We did so with the support of the Clinton administration and a bipartisan coalition of Senators. This bill reflects that language. 
The Senate refused to consider the measure over the last 2 years. In part that may be explained by the opposition from major league baseball team owners and perhaps by a feeling among some that we should not legislate during a time in which there was a labor-management impasse. Both those concerns have now been removed with the recent, 5-year agreement between the major league baseball team owners and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Indeed, a provision in that agreement calls for the owners to lobby Congress in support of the repeal of the antitrust exemption, at least to the extent it relates to labor-management relations. 
It is time to build on the progress we made last year and long past time for the Senate to act. Congress may not be able to solve every problem or heal baseball's self-inflicted wounds, but we can do this: We can pass legislation that will declare that professional baseball can no longer operate above the law. 
Our antitrust laws protect competition and benefit consumers. We are faced with an anomalous situation where the Federal antitrust laws have not applied to certain major league baseball functions and operations for over 70 years. 
I hope that we will, at long last, take up the issue of major leagues baseball's antitrust exemption. The burden of proof is on those who seek to justify this exemption from the law. No other business or professional or amateur sport is possessed of the exemption from law that major league baseball has enjoyed and abused. 
One of the players who testified at our hearings last Congress asked a most perceptive question: If baseball were coming to Congress today to ask us to provide a statutory exemption, would such a bill be passed? I believe the answer to that question is a resounding no. 
In addition, there is and has been no independent commissioner who could look out for the best interests of baseball and its fans. Despite repeated assurances, there has been no action to restore a strong, independent commissioner to oversee the game and it has suffered the consequences. It is only now beginning to emerge from a 4-year struggle without a labor-management agreement. I see that the owners last week authorized their executive committee to begin a search for a new commissioner. In my view baseball would be well served by making a serious commitment to a strong, independent commissioner. Neither fans nor Congress will be inspired by delay, drift or lack of direction. 
In Vermont when I was growing up virtually everyone was a Red Sox fan. Now loyalties are split among teams and among various sports. We have a successful minor league team, the Vermont Expos, the champions of the New York-Penn League last season. We also have businesses and jobs that depend on baseball and fans who have been hurt by its shortsightedness and mismanagement over the past several years. There is a strong public interest in baseball and it reverberates throughout the country. 
I am concerned about the interests of the public and, in particular, the interests of baseball fans. To reiterate the words of baseball's last commissioner, Fay Vincent: `Baseball is more than ownership of an ordinary business. Owners have a duty to take into consideration that they own a part of America's national pastime--in trust. This trust sometimes requires putting self-interest second.' Baseball's fans feel that this trust had been violated over the last several years. 
It is the public that is being shortchanged by the policies and practices of major league baseball and by disregard for the interests of the fans. I look forward to moving ahead thoughtfully to reconsider major league baseball's exemption from legal requirements to which all other businesses must conform their behavior. Since the multi-billion dollar businesses that have grown from what was once our national pastime are now being run accordingly to a financial bottom line, a healthy injection of competition may be just what is needed. 
I want to be reassured, for example, that the minor league teams will not be abandoned or exploited by major league owners and that the negotiations concerning the Professional Baseball Agreement proceed to a fair conclusion without being skewed by some notion of antitrust exemption. I want to consider whether there are measures we in Congress might take to strengthen the hands of cities, taxpayers and fans against the extortionate demands for new stadiums at public expense. I want to revisit the issues of antitrust immunity in connection with sports broadcasting rights and restrictions on viewers' access to programming imposed by major league owners. If I had my way, we would make progress in clarifying each of these matters. 
In an effort to act expeditiously, I am cosponsoring this consensus measure. I look forward to our prompt hearings, Committee and Senate consideration and to working with others to forge a legal framework in which the public will be better served. 
I am delighted and encouraged that the ranking Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. John Conyers, Jr., also acted on the first day of legislative activity in the House to introduce H.R. 21, companion baseball antitrust legislation based on what we reported last Congress. It is right and fitting that he chose Curt Flood's number for this bill. 
Mr. Flood passed away yesterday. His contributions to the game of baseball went well beyond his all star play and outstanding statistics. He was a critical part of championship teams during his years patrolling center field for the St. Louis Cardinals in the late 50's and 60's. He was an outstanding hitter, fielder and all around player in an era of great players. 
His part in baseball history has even more to do with his resolve to stand up for what he knew was the right thing and his legal challenge to the reserve clause, which had bound players to teams for life. He was the plaintiff who sacrificed his career and a place in baseball's Hall of Fame by taking the matter all the way to the United States Supreme Court where, in 1972, the Court challenged Congress to correct the aberration that baseball's antitrust immunity represents in our law. There would be no more fitting tribute to Curt Flood's courage than for this Congress finally to answer that 25-year-old call to action. I hope that we will do so without further delay.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Moynihan for submitting this resolution on the first legislative day of the 105th Congress in support of Ngawang Choephel and other prisoners of conscience in Tibet. 
I first learned about the detention of Tibetan music and dance scholar and former Middlebury College student Ngawang Choephel about a year ago. Students and faculty at Middlebury were leading a letter-writing campaign to urge Chinese authorities to release information about their friend and colleague, who had traveled in 1995 to Tibet to make a documentary film of traditional Tibetan dance and music after spending several months as a Fulbright scholar at Middlebury. No one had seen or herd from Mr. Choephel, until an exiled Tibetan reported seeing him in a Tibetan prison. 
I wrote to the head of the Chinese Communist Party to find out what I could about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts, his health, the evidence against him, and whether he had access to a lawyer. I received no reply. I inquired further. Finally, in October, more than a year after his detention, Chinese authorities reported that Mr. Choephel was charged with violating the State Security Law. He was accused of espionage, and it was insinuated that he was a spy financed by the United States Government. No evidence to support such a claim has ever been produced. The State Department issued a statement calling for Mr. Choephel's release. 
There is no evidence that Mr. Choephel was engaged in any improper activity or even any political activity whatsoever during his trip to Tibet. The 16 hours of film Mr. Choephel sent to India during the first weeks of his project contain the traditional music and dance that he intended to document. Like the State Department, I believe that the Chinese have made a terrible mistake in this case. 
In November, I accompanied Senator Daschle on a trip to China. In meetings with President Jiang Zemin and other officials, I raised Ngawang Choephel's case and urged the President to look into it personally. I have received no response to those inquiries. Only weeks after returning from Beijing, I learned that Mr. Choephel had been sentenced to 18 years in prison, and I immediately wrote again to President Jiang Zemin, urging that Mr. Choephel be released. 
Mr. Choephel's reported confession, secret trial, and unusually long prison sentence underscore the longstanding disregard for the rule of law and the lack of respect for political and cultural rights in Tibet and China. Mr. Choephel is one of thousands who have been persecuted for attempting to preserve what remains of Tibetan culture. 
The resolution introduced by Senator Moynihan calls on the Chinese Government to release Mr. Choephel unconditionally. It also calls on United States officials to raise his case in all meetings with Chinese authorities, to support a resolution on human rights in Tibet and China in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to urge the Chinese to allow international human rights groups to monitor human rights in Tibet, and to support an exchange program for Tibetan students. 
These are measures that will emphasize the importance the United States Senate places on improving respect for human rights in China and Tibet. It is particularly important that the administration takes a stronger position in support of the resolution on China and Tibet in the U.N. Human Rights Commission this year. 
Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Moynihan again for his concern and his leadership on Tibet over the years. I urge all Senators to support this resolution.
