Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Internet Moratorium Act is included in the 1998 omnibus appropriations bill. Present federal law neither authorizes, nor imposes, nor ratifies any excise, sales, or domain registration tax on Internet use for electronic interstate commerce, and only one fee for the Intellectual Infrastructure Fund. This temporary moratorium will prevent federal and state governments from implementing or enforcing taxes imposed on Internet commerce over the next three years. We would also like to clarify that this Congress has not ratified or authorized any federal taxes on Internet domain name registrations. The U.S. Federal Court has stated that Section 8003 ratifies what was previously declared to be an unconstitutional tax. However, it was never intended to ratify a tax on the Internet; it only speaks to a fee for the Intellectual Infrastructure Fund. Because the fee constitutes an unconstitutional tax, it was not ratified by section 8003. I am confident that this moratorium will enable Congress to develop a coherent national strategy of appropriate taxation of business transactions conducted over the Internet without hindering business opportunities and would also like to reiterate that this Congress has never ratified an unconstitutional tax on the Internet.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to announce that I look forward to working with my colleagues in the next Congress to pass legislation to implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, an international agreement that will finally allow our commercial shipyards to compete on equal footing with those of our foreign trading partners. 
With the hard work of Members both in the House and Senate, especially my friend the Majority Leader, we were able to craft implementing legislation that was passed and reported out of both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Finance Committee and had the strong support of the Department of Defense. If a floor vote had been possible this Congress, I am confident we could have passed this important legislation and the President would have signed it into law. 
Unless we as a country are content to concede the international commercial shipbuilding market to our trading partners and rely instead only upon the limited and protected U.S. Jones Act market for commercial shipbuilding orders, we must ratify and implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement. 
So again, I look forward next Congress to working with the Majority Leader, Finance Committee Chairman Roth, Commerce Committee Chairman McCain, and my Democratic and Republican colleagues, including the few Members who remain opposed to the Agreement, to implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement for the benefit of the country and our U.S. entire commercial shipbuilding industry.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 1259, the United States Coast Guard Authorization Act. As many of my distinguished colleagues know, I have a great deal of admiration for the Coast Guard, as well as for Coast Guard men and women that carry out critical missions for our country. Before going into greater detail on the importance of the Coast Guard, I wish to discuss an amendment that Senator Ford and I intended to offer to this bill, but have withdrawn in order to address certain concerns raised by my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee. Our amendment would have eliminated the unjustified use of strict criminal liability statutes that do not require a showing of criminal intent or even the slight negligence in oil spill incidents. 
Through comprehensive congressional action that led to the enactment and implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, commonly referred to as `OPA90,' the United States has successfully reduced the number of oil spills in the maritime environment and has established a cooperative public/private partnership to respond effectively in the diminishing number of situations when an oil spill occurs. Nonetheless, over the course of the last eight years, the use of the unrelated strict criminal liability statutes that I referred to above has undermined the spill prevention and response objectives of OPA90, the very objectives that were established by the Congress to preserve the environment, safeguard the public welfare, and promote the safe transportation of oil. Reasonable, measured refinements in federal law are urgently required to preserve the objectives of OPA90 by preventing the unjustified use of strict criminal liability in oil spill incidents. Accordingly, I have been working with my distinguished colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, and other members of the Senate to include legislation in this bill to enact such refinements. 
As stated in the coast Guard's own environmental enforcement directive, a company, its officers, employees, and mariners, in the event of an oil spill `could be convicted and sentenced to a criminal fine even where [they] took all reasonable precautions to avoid the discharge'. With increasing frequency, responsible operators in my home state of Louisiana and elsewhere in the United States who transport oil are unavoidably exposed to potentially immeasurable criminal fines and, in the worst case scenario, jail time. Not only is this situation unfairly targeting an industry that plays an extremely important role in our national economy, but it also works contrary to the public welfare.

Mr. BREAUX. through the efforts of AWO and other organizations, the maritime transportation industry has achieved an outstanding compliance record with the numerous laws and regulations enforced by the Coast Guard. Let me be 
clear: responsible carriers, and frankly their customers, have a `zero tolerance' policy for oil spills. For example, I am aware of a major marine transportation company headquartered in Louisiana that has a record of having performed over 5,300 liquid cargo transfer operations without spilling or contaminating any of the almost 2.8 billion gallons it transferred over a recent three year period. Additionally, the industry is taking spill response preparedness seriously. Industry representatives and operators routinely participate in Coast Guard oil spill crisis management courses, PREP Drills, and regional spill response drills. Yet despite all of the modernization, safety, and training efforts of the marine transportation industry, their mariners and shoreside employees cannot escape the threat of criminal liability in the event of an oil spill, even where it is shown that they `took all reasonable precautions to avoid [a] discharge'. 
Mr. President, as you know, in response to the tragic Exxon Valdez spill, Congress enacted OPA90. OPA90 mandated new, comprehensive, and complex regulatory and enforcement requirements for the transportation of oil products and for oil spill response. Both the federal government and maritime industry have worked hard to accomplish the legislation's primary objective--to provide greater environmental safeguards in oil transportation by creating a comprehensive prevention, response, liability, and compensation regime to deal with vessel and facility oil pollution.

Mr. BREAUX. My colleague from Kentucky and I do not advocate nor do we support any effort to change the tough criminal sanctions that were imposed in OPA90. The criminal sanctions under OPA90 properly follow the traditional notion of what constitutes a criminal act in this country, namely, that a crime occurs when a knowing, intentional act is committed or when a party's conduct is so egregious that `negligence' has occurred. These tough, comprehensive OPA90 provisions collectively operate as a major deterrent for oil spills and should not be changed. 
However, responsible, law-abiding members of the maritime industry in Louisiana and elsewhere are concerned by both the justice Department's willingness in the post-OPA90 environment to use strict criminal liability statues and the Coast Guard's increasing attention to criminal enforcement in oil spill incidents. As you know, strict liability imposes criminal sanctions without 
requiring a showing of criminal knowledge, intent or even negligence. These federal actions imposing strict liability have created an atmosphere of extreme uncertainty for the maritime transportation industry and Oil Spill Response Organizations (OSROs) about how to respond to and cooperate with the Coast Guard and other federal agencies in cleaning up an oil spill. Criminal culpability in this country, both historically and as reflected in the comprehensive OPA90 legislation itself, typically requires wrongful actions or omissions by individuals through some degree of criminal intent or through the failure to use the required standard of care. However, Federal prosecutors have been employing other antiquated, seemingly unrelated `strict liability' statutes that do not require a showing of `knowledge' or `intent' as a basis for criminal prosecution for oil spill incidents. Such strict criminal liability statutes as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, statutes that were enacted at the turn of the century to serve other purposes, have been used to harass and intimidate the maritime industry, and, in effect, have turned every oil spill into a potential crime scene without regard to the fault or intent of companies, corporate officers and employees, and mariners. 
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) provides that `it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or kill, . . . any migratory bird . . .', a violation of which is punishable by imprisonment and/or fines. Prior to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the MBTA was primarily used to prosecute the illegal activities of hunters and capturers of migratory birds, as the Congress originally intended when it enacted the MBTA in 1918. In the Exxon Valdez case itself, and prior to the enactment of OPA90, the MBTA was first used to support a criminal prosecution against a vessel owner in relation to a maritime oil spill, and this `hunting statute' has been used ever since against the maritime industry. The `Refuse Act' (33 U.S.C. 407, 411) was enacted 100 years ago at a time well before subsequent federal legislation essentially replaced it with comprehensive requirements and regulations specifically directed to the maritime transportation of oil and other petroleum products. Such strict liability statutes are unrelated to the regulation and enforcement of oil transportation activities, and in fact were not included within the comprehensive OPA90 legislation as statutes in which criminal liability could be found. With the prosecutorial use of strict liability statutes, owners and mariners engaged in the transportation of oil cannot avoid exposure to criminal liability, regardless of how diligently they adhere to prudent practice and safe environmental standards. Although conscientious safety and training programs, state-of-the-art equipment, proper operational procedures, preventative maintenance programs, and the employment of qualified and experienced personnel will collectively prevent most oil spills from occurring, unfortunately spills will still occur on occasion.

Mr. BREAUX. As the scenario presented by my colleague from Kentucky demonstrates, the unjustified use of strict liability statutes is plainly undermining the very objectives which OPA90 sought to achieve, namely to enhance the prevention of and response to oil spills in Louisiana and elsewhere in the United States. As we are well aware, tremendous time, effort, and resources have been expended by both the federal government and the maritime industry to eliminate oil spills to the maximum extent possible, an to plan for and undertake an immediate and effective response to mitigate any environmental damage from spills that do occur. Clearly unwarranted and improper prosecutorial use of strict liability statutes will have a `chilling' effect on these cooperative spill prevention and response efforts. Indeed, even if we were to believe that criminal prosecution only follows intentional criminal conduct, the mere fact that strict criminal liability statutes are available at the prosecutor's discretion will intimidate even the most innocent and careful operator. With strict liability criminal enforcement, responsible members of the maritime transportation industry and faced with an extreme dilemma in the event of an oil spill--provide less than full cooperation and response as criminal defense attorneys will certainly direct, or cooperate fully despite the risk of criminal prosecution that could result from any additional actions or statements made during the course of the spill response. Consequently, increased criminalization of oil spill incidents introduces uncertainty into the response effort by discouraging full and open communication and cooperation and leaves vessel owners and operators criminally vulnerable for response actions taken in an effort to `do the right thing'.

Mr. BREAUX. Therefore, Mr. President, despite the commitment and effort to provide trained and experienced vessel operators and employees, to comply with all Coast Guard laws and regulations, to abide by the safety and other operational mandates of the AWO Responsible Carrier Program and other similar industry initiatives, and to provide for the safe transportation of oil as required by OPA90, maritime transportation companies in Louisiana, Kentucky, and elsewhere still cannot avoid criminal liability in the event of an oil spill. Responsible, law-abiding companies have unfortunately been forced to undertake the only prudent action that they could under the circumstances, namely the development of criminal liability action plans and retention of criminal counsel in an attempt to prepare for the unavoidable risks of such liability. 
These are only preliminary steps and do not begin to address the many implications of the increasing criminalization of oil spills. The industry is now asking what responsibility does it have to educate its mariners and shoreside staff about the potential personal exposure they may face and wonder how to do this without creating many undesirable consequences? How should the industry organize spill management teams and educate them on how to cooperate openly 
 and avoid unwitting exposure to criminal liability? Mr. President, my colleague from Kentucky and I have thought about these issues a great deal and simply do not know how to resolve these dilemmas under current, strict liability law.

Mr. BREAUX. To restore the delicate balance of interests reached in the enactment of OPA90 almost eight years ago, I strongly believe that the Congress should reaffirm the OPA90 framework for criminal prosecutions in oil spill incidents, and work to enact legislation that reasserts the role of OPA90 as the statute providing the exclusive criminal penalties for oil spills. My colleague from Kentucky and I have proposed such legislation that will ensure increased cooperation and responsiveness desired by all those interested in oil spill response issues, while not diluting the deterrent effect and stringent criminal penalties imposed by OPA90 itself. My colleague from Kentucky and I are hopeful that we can work with Senator Chafee and other Members of the Congress to ensure the passage of such reform measures to preserve the oil spill prevention and response objectives of OPA90. 
Mr. President, another issue of great importance which is addressed in this legislation is the double hull alternative design study. Section 417 directs the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with the Marine Board of the National Research Council to conduct necessary research and development for alternative tanker designs to the double hull. If this effort utilizes technical performance standards it will undoubtedly enhance development designs such as the central ballast tanker system. These, American designs, some of which have already passed rigorous scientific tests and meet or exceed international shipbuilding standards, have not in my mind received appropriate attention. In my opinion, this may be due to inaccurate interpretation of Congress' intent which the Coast guard believes restricts any consideration of alternative designs to the double hull. 
Let me be clear, I am not opposed to the double hull design. In fact, I believe there is a place for the double hull. However, to consider only the double hull, while ignoring new, innovative technology which has been developed since the passage of the Clean Water Act and OPA90 exhibits bad judgment and simply put is bad policy. It is estimated that 8,000 tankers will have to be constructed or redesigned by 2015 to meet the requirements of the petroleum industry. This equates to a ship building program which the industry conservatively estimates to be worth $400 billion, all of which will be built by foreign shipyards if we do not pursue alternative designs. For those who do not believe that U.S. shipyards can't compete--just look at what's happening right now. Currently, there are two hundred double hull tankers under construction or contract around the world of which only two have been built in the United States, both of which lost money for the U.S. shipyard. In fact, I am told that the U.S. shipyard which built these two double hull ships has refused to construct anymore. Without incorporating innovative design and technology, our shipyards and U.S. workers will lose out to Japanese, Korean, Norwegian and other foreign yards and workers. 
Mr. President, this issue is about more than jobs. Being from Louisiana, I am intimately familiar with the importance of this issue from an environmental standpoint. I grew up on Louisiana's Gulf coast and know first hand how environmentally sensitive our wetlands and coastlines are and also appreciate how important their health is to the livelihood of the many people who live along the richest fishery in the world. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that all of us in Louisiana, and I suspect just about all those who live along the Gulf Coast, are extremely concerned with the safety and reliability of oil transport vessels in our waters. Innovative designs like the central ballast tanker system will add a greater degree of safety in our waters an will further protect our sensitive and vitally important coastal ecosystem. 
I am confident that the Secretary, in conjunction with the Marine Board, the Coast Guard and industry leaders will pull together to consider and eventually approve alternative designs to the double hull so our waters can be cleaner and safer and our shipyards and American workers will successfully participate in 
tanker construction in the years to come. 
Mr. President, as I initially indicated, I have a great deal of admiration for the U.S. Coast Guard. I therefore, stand here today in support of S. 1259 the United States Coast Guard Authorization Act. 
The Coast Guard is essential to the safety and well being of the citizens of my home state of Louisiana, as well as every other coastal State, every State with navigable waters and even several landlocked States. 
Using Louisiana as an example, with its hundreds of miles of coastline, active maritime and fishing industries, and thriving recreational boating population the Coast Guard must be at full strength. The payback to our nation is unparalleled. For instance, every year the Coast Guard: 
Saves about 5,000 lives; 
Conducts 65,700 search and rescue missions; 
Responds to 11,680 hazardous waste spills; 
Protects vital marine habitats from encroachment and pollution; 
Maintains 50,000 aids to ensure maritime safety; and 
Keeps $2.6 billion worth of drugs off U.S. streets. 
In the Greater New Orleans area alone, the Coast Guard: 
Conducted over 300 search and rescue missions; 
Responded to 2500 pollution incidents; 
Investigated nearly 700 marine casualties; 
Conducted over 2700 vessel inspections; and 
Seized hundreds of pounds of drugs (Marijuana and Cocaine). 
In the event my distinguished colleagues aren't already amazed let me continue. More than two-thirds of the total budget for the Coast Guard goes to operating expenses to protect public safety and the marine environment, to enforce fishery and other laws and treaties, maintain aids to navigation, prevent illegal drug trafficking and illegal immigrants, and preserve defense readiness. I believe it's our responsibility to ensure that the Coast Guard has adequate resources for its missions as it prepares for the next century. As I've outlined, the resources we provide to the Coast Guard have a direct impact on our communities. The Coast Guard's Search and Rescue Program alone provides a four-to-one return on their Operating Expenses Appropriation and only scratched the surface of what the Coast Guard does for America, everyday, around the clock. This pay-pack is unrivaled and can only be claimed by a few agencies, including the Coast Guard. 
Always serving as an example, over the past 4 years, the Coast Guard on its own initiative to reduce overhead eliminated close to 4,000 positions and streamlined to save approximately $400 million per year. This has resulted in the smallest Coast Guard since 1967, yet their workload has grown substantially over the past 3 decades. Over the years, we the Congress has continued to expand the Coast Guard's mission. The `can-do' attitude they continually display should serve as an example to us all. However, we can no longer force this proud maritime service to do more with less. 
I now call my colleagues to action. The Coast Guard's fiscal year 1999 budget request contains the minimum funding necessary to sustain Coast Guard operations. As a co-sponsor of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, I strongly support increased counter-drug operations, but I believe earmarks to increase them at the expense of several other Coast Guard missions inside a net reduction in operating expenses is not possible. 
It goes without saying how important the Coast Guard is to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to assure all necessary funding be secured in the 1999 Transportation Appropriations Bill, expected on the floor any day now. Restoration of earmarks are paramount to avoid necessary loss of life and negatively impacting public safety. I urge my colleagues to ensure the Coast Guard is provided a fiscal year budget very close to the President's request.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Medicare Home Health Fair Payment Act of 1998. This is an issue that I have worked on for several months with Senator Grassley and other Members of the Senate and I am pleased that the Senate has addressed this issue before adjourning. 
I am the first to admit that there is too much fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare's home health benefit and there is probably no other state where the problem is more pronounced than Louisiana. Every graph I see on home health shows Louisiana off the charts--Louisiana has the highest per beneficiary spending in the country; we have more visits per patient than any other state in the country; Louisiana represents 5.2% of all Medicare home health visits even though only 2.3% of Medicare beneficiaries live in the state. There are 466 home health agencies in Louisiana--we have more home health agencies than McDonalds in the state. So I know firsthand that there are problems with home health and that states like Louisiana could afford a reduction in the number of agencies. The problem is that the interim payment system crafted by Congress and the Administration last year is causing the wrong agencies to go out of business. 
It is clear that the IPS has had serious unintended consequences. In Louisiana and other states, the interim payment system has for the most part rewarded inefficient providers and forced many low-cost, efficient agencies out of the program. For example, you could have one agency with a per beneficiary limit of $12,000 competing with another agency down the street with a per beneficiary limit of $4,000. What we did with IPS is essentially put that $4,000 agency at such a competitive disadvantage that there is no way it can stay in business. 
When we finally move home health to prospective payment, it is critical that some low-cost providers be in business to treat patients who need home care. The Grassley-Breaux bill that we introduced several months ago tried to level the playing field by bringing the very high cost providers down while raising the reimbursement for low cost providers. This reflects what will happen under prospective payment when all providers will essentially be paid the same amount for treating the same kind of patient. We also eliminated the distinction between old and new providers in an attempt to further level the playing field. To ensure that high cost patients would still have access to home health, the Grassley-Breaux bill included an outlier policy so that home health agencies would not turn high cost patients away. 
The interim payment reform proposal put forward by Senators Roth and Moynihan is an important first step towards fixing IPS and I applaud the bipartisan approach the Senate used in arriving at this proposal. I think most members would argue that much more needs to be done and I would agree. I am hearing from many home health agencies in Louisiana that this bill will only be of marginal help to the state but that it is important that something get done this year. As is the case with most things we do around here, particularly in the waning hours of this Congress, getting something is better than getting nothing. I am pleased that there is a bipartisan commitment by the Senate Finance Committee to revisit this issue next year and take a much more comprehensive look at the home health benefit. It is imperative that the Congress address this issue again next year since this proposal represents only a temporary fix. But it is an important one. The Senate bill:

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to express my enthusiastic support for the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which was passed by the Senate earlier today. This legislation condemns religious persecution and promotes what is indisputably a fundamental human right--the right to freedom or religion. 
I am proud to have co-sponsored this legislation, which I might add was passed by the Senate without opposition. That is due in no small part to the efforts of Senators Nickles and Lieberman. I want to commend them and their staffs for all the hard work they've done to craft a bill that is meaningful and effective without being excessively rigid or inflexible. 
Mr. President, it has amazed me to see how Americans' awareness of religious persecution abroad has grown just in this decade. It is, no doubt, a result of the incredible resources and vast amounts of information that ordinary Americans now have at their fingertips. As more and more people gain access to the Internet, the velocity of information continues to increase. Americans have learned about religious persecution by foreign governments around the globe and they expect our government to take serious action to curb this behavior. 
Their can be no doubt that we have a responsibility to advocate and encourage freedom of religion in foreign lands. We, as a nation, have always held it to be the most sacrosanct of human rights. Indeed, it is not just enshrined in our Bill of Rights, it is a thread that is woven into the very fabric of our national identity. 
The International Religious Freedom Act channels U.S. assistance to governments that are not gross violators of human rights, in particular the right to religious freedom. It provides for sanctions or other comparable action against countries that persecute citizens on religious grounds. The bill establishes a Commission on International Religious Persecution to publish yearly recommendations to the White House and the Congress on how to promote religious freedom abroad. It also establishes an Ambassador-at-Large of Religious Freedom within the State Department and a Special Advisor on International Religious Freedom within the National Security Council. As a result, it requires the Administration to produce a yearly `Annual Report on Religious Freedom Around the World.' 
Mr. President, these are reasonable provisions that I believe will help focus our efforts to stand up for religious freedom abroad while at the same time allowing the executive branch a degree of needed flexibility to deal with different facts and circumstances in different instances of persecution. It is an important bill, and I am hopeful that the Congress can send it to the President for signature before adjournment.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today my colleague Connie Mack and I are introducing legislation that would improve Medicare inpatient psychiatric care by reforming how Medicare pays for services provided in free-standing psychiatric hospitals and distinct-part psychiatric units of general hospitals. The Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective Payment System Act of 1998 would establish over time a prospective payment system (PPS) for these providers. Currently psychiatric hospitals and units are exempt from PPS. Their costs are reimbursed under provisions in the 1982 Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, or TEFRA. 
The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 made significant changes to the TEFRA payment system by reducing incentive payments and imposing a limit on what Medicare will pay for services provided in psychiatric facilities, regardless of a facility's costs. The result is that many of these providers will be hit hard by deep and sudden cuts, with no transition period to adjust to the changes. I believe that moving psychiatric hospitals to a prospective payment system will ensure that these changes do not reduce patient access to psychiatric care. 
Our legislation proposes to transition psychiatric inpatient hospitals to a prospective payment system--a system that will be more efficient, allow for better planning, and lead to improved patient care. This legislation also addresses the short-term viability of many of these facilities to enable patients to continue receiving the specialized care these providers offer. For that reason, our legislation includes immediate financial relief to those psychiatric facilities hardest hit by the BBA: twenty-five percent of facilities in the first year, about thirteen percent in year two, and approximately ten percent in year three. The relief will then be paid back when a prospective payment is implemented in year four to ensure that this bill is budget neutral by the end of year five. Specifically, the Breaux-Mack bill would limit an individual facility's payment reductions to no more than five percent in the first year, seven and one-half percent in the second year, and ten percent in year three. After the third year, a PPS based on per diems would be phased in. In the first two years of the new PPS, the per-diem rates would be adjusted downward to pay back the savings lost to the Medicare program as a result of the `hold harmless' provisions of the bill. Consequently, our bill is budget-neutral over five years, yet it provides some measure of relief to those Medicare providers most severely affected by the BBA and guarantees that beneficiaries will not lose vital services. But perhaps the most important feature of our bill is that it moves the last of the TEFRA providers--psychiatric facilities--out of a cost-based payment system and into a system where they will be paid prospectively, like most other Medicare providers. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana and congratulate her for all the effort she has put forth in bringing this legislation to this point. 
I have been in Congress for a long time--something like 26 years now, in the House and in this body--and I have never really seen a first-term Member who has been so dedicated to a major legislative effort as has the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, in bringing this legislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Many Members, on their first day, have come in and introduced a bill, issued a press release, and then forgotten about it. This has been an effort by the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, of very carefully prodding and very carefully studying and working with Members on both sides of the aisle to put together a bipartisan coalition to bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate. 
While this is brought to the floor of the Senate in the last days of this session, we all know that there will be another day. The groundwork that she has laid in putting this package and this coalition together is going to be here in the next Congress. So in the next Congress we will start not from scratch but from the groundwork that she has laid in bringing this legislation to the point it is today. 
I congratulate her for the way she has done it. It is something that I have not seen by a new Member of the Congress in all of the years that I have been here. It is a major accomplishment on her part. I am very pleased to participate in it. 
Just a brief word on the legislation. I think it is a fair thing to do. Many non-coastal States have Federal property, owned 100 percent by the Federal Government, within their borders. When minerals are extracted or oil and gas are found on those Federal lands, the State in which those lands are located gets as much as 50 percent of the revenue. Coastal States, however, get nothing. That is clearly not fair. Offshore mineral development operations have a major impact on coastal Louisiana. These operations impact our roads, bridges and other infrastructure, our freshwater supply, our housing and other vital public resources. It is only fair that there be a reasonable sharing of those revenues with states that bear these kinds of burdens. The impact coastal states suffer is a burden borne for the good of the whole country and, without it, the whole country would suffer. 
Therefore, to share in a true partnership with the coastal States is certainly something that this Congress should favorably consider, and I think that we will because of what the Senator has been able to do in a bipartisan fashion. So while it is late this year, it is early for next year. The work that she has done this year will pay off next year.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished senior Senator from the State of Mississippi and my colleague on the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Senator Cochran, in introducing the Electronic Duck Stamp Act. I believe it is legislation all of our colleagues should support. 
The Electronic Duck Stamp Act would authorize electronic issuance of the federal migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp. A number of states are setting up electronic licensing systems so their hunters can purchase all their state hunting licenses at one time and in one location. This bill will help coordinate federal and state licensing systems and provide sportsmen and sportswomen the convenience of getting all their hunting licenses, federal and state, in one location. I believe this added convenience will increase `duck stamp' sales. This, in turn, will increase the total funds deposited into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund for the purchase of suitable habitat for migratory birds. These funds are essential to the long-term survival of our migratory bird populations.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last night, after several years of effort, the Senate passed S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, and I strongly urge the President to sign this important piece of legislation into law. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 modifies our existing shipping regulatory scheme by bringing it up to date with the industry as it operates today. It provides more flexibility for carriers and shippers to agree on transportation arrangements. It authorizes the privatized publication of rate information. It gives individual carrier conference members more leeway in taking independent actions and in entering service contracts, and thus makes the current system more competitive. 
Yet the bill also preserves the basic system and principles of common carriage, and maintains protections for ocean transportation users against unfair or unreasonable actions by transportation providers. Importantly, S. 414 preserves the Federal Maritime Commission as an independent regulatory agency, which is vitally important as that agency enforces this program while it additionally ensures that our trades remain free from restrictive foreign shipping practices that impede our oceanborne foreign commerce. 
The reason this bill was so long in coming is that the Senate took great care to make the legislative process an open one. I was critical of shipping legislation passed in the other body three years ago, because it did not reflect the diversity of concerns reflected in the broad spectrum of shipping interests. It was, as I noted at a Commerce Committee hearing, `conceived in darkness.' By contrast, the legislation ultimately agreed to by both the House and Senate is truly a compromise, in which all industry interests were heard from and all sectors had input. No one got everything they wanted in this legislation, and no one's interests were completely disregarded. This legislation is a carefully crafted balance of the many interests at stake. When it was necessary, members of all segments sat down and negotiated a compromise. Not everyone is completely pleased with all aspects of the legislation, but it is incumbent upon us to move forward. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank a number of members of both the House and Senate for their efforts on this bill including; Congressmen Shuster, Oberstar, Gilchrest and Clement in the House, and Senators McCain and Hollings, the Subcommittee Chairwoman Senator Hutchison and of course, Senator Lott in the Senate. I would also like to thank Jim Sartucci of Senator McCain's staff and my counsel, Carl Bentzel, for their long hours of hard work and industry constituent service as they pieced this bill together. Without the efforts of Senate staffers, Amy Henderson, Jeanne Bumpus and Carl Biersack, and Mark Ashby of my staff, and House staffers John Cullather and Rebecca Dye we would not have been able to move this bill. I would also commend the FMC for its objective assessments and contributions to this project, particularly FMC Chairman Hal Creel, General Counsel Tom Panebianco and Legislative Counsel Dave Miles. When we needed expertise, they provided us with help. 
I am particularly pleased that the Federal Maritime Commission will continue its mission as a nonpartisan, independent agency. The Commission, under Chairman Hal Creel, and with fellow Commissioners Ming Hsu, Joe Scroggins and Del Won, has done an excellent job administering our shipping laws in a firm but even-handed manner. I urge the FMC to keep up the good work, and to keep Congress informed of how the new legislation is working. I am particularly interested in whether the protections afforded the smaller shippers and intermediaries against unreasonable practices prove to be sufficient. To this end, I ask that the FMC pay particular attention to these parties' concerns about the new law and advise us of any recommended amendments to the legislation that may prove to be in order. 
Again, I encourage the President to sign the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 into law.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today Mr. Mack and I are introducing legislation to place a permanent moratorium on the Department of the Treasury's authority to finalize any proposed regulations issued pursuant to Notice 98-35, dealing with the treatment of hybrid branch transactions under subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. It also prohibits Treasury from issuing new regulations relating to the tax treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F and requires the Secretary to conduct a study of the tax treatment of hybrid transactions and to provide a written report to the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means. 
By way of background, the United States generally subjects U.S. citizens and corporations to current taxation on their worldwide income. Two important devices mitigate or eliminate double taxation of income earned from foreign sources. First, bilateral income tax treaties with many countries exempt American taxpayers from paying foreign taxes on certain types of income (e.g. interest) and impose reduced rates of tax on other types (e.g. dividends and royalties). Second, U.S. taxpayers receive a credit against U.S. taxes for foreign taxes paid on foreign source income. To reiterate, these devices have been part of our international tax rules for decades and are aimed at preventing U.S. businesses from being taxed twice on the same income. The policy of currently taxing U.S. citizens on their worldwide income is in direct contrast with the regimes employed by most of our foreign trading competitors. Generally they tax their citizens and domestic corporations only on the income earned within their borders (the so-called `water's edge' approach). 
Foreign corporations generally are also not subject to U.S. tax on income earned outside the United States, even if the foreign corporation is controlled by a U.S. parent. Thus, U.S. tax on income earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies--that is, from foreign operations conducted through a controlled foreign corporation (CFC)--is generally deferred until dividends paid by the CFC are received by its U.S. parent. This policy is referred to as `tax deferral.' 
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed eliminating tax deferral with respect to the earnings of U.S.-controlled foreign subsidiaries. The proposal provided that U.S. corporations would be currently taxable on their share of the earnings of CFCs, except in the case of investments in certain `less developed countries.' The business community strongly opposed the proposal, arguing that in order for U.S. multinational companies to be able to compete effectively in global markets, their CFCs should be subject only to the same taxes to which their foreign competitors were subject. 
In the Revenue Act of 1962, Congress rejected the President's proposal to completely eliminate tax deferral, recognizing that to do so would place U.S. companies operating in overseas markets at a significant disadvantage vis-a-vis their foreign competitors. Instead, Congress opted to adopt a policy regime designed to end deferral only with respect to income earned from so-called `tax haven' operations. This regime, known as `subpart F,' generally is aimed at currently taxing foreign source income that is easily moveable from one taxing jurisdiction to another and that is subject to low rates of foreign tax. 
Thus, the subpart F provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (found in sections 951-964) have always reflected a balancing of two competing policy objectives: capital export neutrality (i.e. neutrality of taxation as between domestic and foreign operations) and capital import neutrality (i.e. neutrality of taxation as between CFCs and their foreign competitors). While these competing principles continue to form the foundation of subpart F today, recent actions by the Department of the Treasury threaten to upset this long-standing balance. 
On January 16, 1998, the Department of the Treasury announced in Notice 98-1l its intention to issue regulations to prevent the use of hybrid branches `to circumvent the purposes of subpart F.' The hybrid branch arrangements identified in Notice 98-11 involved entities characterized for U.S. tax purposes as part of a controlled foreign corporation, but characterized for purposes of the tax law of the country in which the CFC was incorporated as a separate entity. The Notice indicated that the creation of such hybrid branches was facilitated by the entity classification rules contained in section 301.7701-I through -3 of the income Tax Regulations (the `check the box' regulations). 
Notice 98-11 acknowledged that U.S. international tax policy seeks to balance the objectives of capital export neutrality with the objective of allowing U.S. businesses to compete on a level playing field with foreign competitors. In the view of the Treasury and IRS, however, the hybrid transactions attacked in the Notice `upset that balance.' Treasury indicated that the regulations to be issued generally would apply to hybrid branch arrangements entered into or substantially modified after January 16, 1998, and would provide that certain payments to and from foreign hybrid branches of CFCs would be treated as generating subpart F income to U.S. shareholders in situations in which subpart F would not otherwise apply to a hybrid branch as a separate entity. This represented a significant expansion of subpart F, by regulation rather than through legislation. 
Shortly after Notice 98-11 was issued, the Administration released its Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposals which, among other things, included a provision requesting Congress to statutorily grant broad regulatory authority to the Treasury Secretary to prescribe regulations clarifying the tax consequences of hybrid transactions in cases in which the intended results are inconsistent with the purposes of U.S. tax law. . . .' While the explanation accompanying the budget proposal argued that this grant of authority as applied to many cases `merely makes the Secretary's current general regulatory authority more specific, and directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations pursuant to such authority,' the explanation conceded that in other cases, `the Secretary's authority may be questioned and should be clarified.' 
Notice 98-11 and the accompanying budget proposal generated widespread concerns in the Congress and the business community that the Treasury was undertaking a major new initiative in the international tax arena that would undermine the ability of U.S. multinationals to compete in international markets. For example, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer wrote to Treasury Secretary Rubin on March 20, 1998 requesting that `Notice 98-11 be withdrawn and that no regulations in this area be issued or allowed to take effect until Congress has an appropriate opportunity, to consider these matters in the normal legislative process.' The Ranking Democrat on the Committee, Charles Rangel, wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing strong concerns about the Treasury's increasing propensity to `legislate through the regulatory process as evidenced by Notice 98-11. 
Despite these concerns, on March 23, 1998, the Treasury department issued two sets of proposed and temporary regulations, the first relating to the treatment of hybrid branch arrangements under subpart F, and the second relating to the treatment of a CFC's distributive share of partnership income. As Notice 98-1l had promised, the regulations provided that certain payments between a controlled foreign corporation and a hybrid branch would be recharacterized as subpart F income if the payments reduce the payer's foreign taxes. 
The week after the temporary and proposed regulations were issued, the Senate Finance Committee considered H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. A provision was included in the bill prohibiting the Treasury and IRS from implementing temporary or final regulations with respect to Notice 98-11 prior to six months after the date of enactment of H.R. 2676. The Senate bill also included language expressing the `sense of the Senate' that `the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service should withdraw Notice 98-11 and the regulations issued thereunder, and that the Congress, and not the Department of the treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, should determine the international tax policy issues relating to the treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F provisions of the Code.' 
Opposition to Notice 98-11 and the temporary and proposed regulations continued to mount. On April 23, 1998, 33 Members of the House Ways and Means Committee wrote to Secretary Rubin expressing concern about the Treasury's decision to move forward and issue regulations pursuant to Notice 98-11 without an appropriate opportunity for Congress to consider this issue in the normal legislative process, urging Treasury to withdraw the regulations. 
In the face of these and other pressures from the Congress and the business community, on June 19, 1998, the Treasury Department announced in Notice 98-35 that it was withdrawing Notice 98-1l and the related temporary, and proposed regulations. According to Notice 98-35, Treasury intends to issue a new set of proposed regulations to be effective in general for payments made under hybrid branch arrangements on or after June 19, 1998. These regulations, however, will not be finalized before January 1, 2000, in order to permit both the Congress and Treasury Department the opportunity to further study the issues that were raised following the publication of Notice 98-1l earlier this year. 
While we applaud the Treasury's decision to withdraw Notice 98-1l and the temporary regulations, we believe that additional legislative action is needed to prevent the Treasury from finalizing the forthcoming regulations until Congress considers the issues involved. We believe that only the Congress has the authority to achieve a permanent resolution of this issue. Notice 98-35, like its predecessor, Notice 98-1l continues to suffer from a fatal flaw; it is the prerogative of Congress, and not the Executive Branch, to pass laws establishing the nation's fundamental tax policies. Simply put, Notice 98-35 adds restrictions to the subpart F regime that are not supported by the Code's clear statutory language, and there has been no express delegation of regulatory authority to the Treasury that relates specifically to the issues presented in the Notice. 
More importantly, we question the policy objectives to be achieved by Notice 98-35 and the accompanying proposed regulations. We do not understand the rationale for penalizing U.S. multinational companies for employing normal tax planning strategies that reduce foreign (as opposed to U.S.) income taxes. Moreover, Notice 98-35 is contrary to recent Congressional efforts to simplify the international tax provisions of the Code. For example, the Congress reduced complexity and ridded the code of a perverse incentive for U.S. companies to invest overseas by repealing the Section 956A tax on excess passive earnings in 1996. Again in 1997, the Congress repealed the application of the Passive Foreign Investment Company regime to U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations because of the complexity involved in applying both regimes, in addition to enacting a host of other foreign tax simplifications. Therefore, in order for Congress to gain a better understanding of the Treasury Department's position on this matter, our bill would require the Treasury to conduct a thorough study of the tax treatment of hybrid transactions under subpart F and to provide a report to the Senate Committee on Finance and House Committee on Ways and Means on this issue. 
If the forthcoming regulations are permitted to be finalized by the Treasury, U S multinational businesses will be placed at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign companies who remain free to employ strategies to reduce the foreign taxes they pay. Clearly, such a result should be permitted to take effect only if Congress, after having an opportunity to fully consider all of the tax and economic issues involved, agrees that the arguments advanced by the Treasury are compelling and determines that additional statutory changes to subpart F are necessary and appropriate.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would make a technical change in the Internal Revenue Code. We often talk about the need to simplify the Tax Code. The change I propose today would do that. 
This change is small but very important. It would not alter the substance of current law in any way. It would, however, greatly simplify a common corporate transaction. This small technical change will alone save corporations millions of dollars in unnecessary expenses and economic costs that are incurred when they divide their businesses. 
The Treasury Department agrees that there is a technical problem with the drafting of the Tax Code. It also agrees that a legislative change like the bill I introduce today is the best way to correct it. 
Corporations, and affiliated groups of corporations, often find it advantageous, or even necessary, to separate two or more businesses. The division of AT&T from its local telephone companies is an example of such a transaction. The reasons for these corporate divisions are many, but probably chief among them is the ability of management to focus on one core business. 
At the end of the day, when a corporation divides, the stockholders simply have the stock of two corporations, instead of one. The Tax Code recognizes this is not an event that should trigger tax, as it includes corporate divisions among the tax-free reorganization provisions. 
One requirement the Tax Code imposes on corporate divisions is very awkwardly drafted, however. As a result, an affiliated group of corporations that wishes to divide must often engage in complex and burdensome preliminary reorganizations in order to accomplish what, for a single corporate entity, would be a rather simple and straightforward spinoff of a business to its shareholders. The small technical change I propose today would eliminate the need for these unnecessary transactions, while keeping the statute true to Congress' original purpose. 
More specifically, section 355 (and related provisions of the Code) permits a corporation or an affiliated group of corporations to divide on a tax-free basis into two or more separate entities with separate businesses. There are numerous requirements for tax-free treatment of a corporate division, or `spinoff,' including continuity of historical shareholder interest, continuity of the business enterprises, business purpose, and absence of any device to distribute earnings and profits. In addition, section 355 requires that each of the divided corporate entities be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. The proposed change would alter none of these substantive requirements of the Code. 
Section 355(b)(2)(A) currently provides an attribution or `lookthrough' rule for groups of corporations that operate active businesses under a holding company, which is necessary because a holding company, by definition, is not itself engaged in an active business. This lookthrough rule inexplicably requires, however, that `substantially all' of the assets of the holding company consist of stock of active controlled subsidiaries. The practical effect of this language is to prevent holding companies from engaging in spinoffs if they own almost any other assets. This is in sharp contrast to corporations that operate businesses directly, which can own substantial assets unrelated to the business and still engage in tax-free spinoff transactions. 
In the real world, of course, holding companies may, for many sound business reasons, hold other assets, such as noncontrolling (less than 80 percent) interests in subsidiaries, controlled subsidiaries that have been owned for less than five years (which are not considered `active businesses' under section 355), or a host of nonbusiness assets. Such holding companies routinely undertake spinoff transactions, but because of the awkward language used in section 355(b)(2)A), they must first undertake one or more (often a series of) preliminary reorganizations solely for the purpose of complying with this inexplicable language of the Code. 
Such preliminary reorganizations are at best costly, burdensome, and without any business purpose, and at worst, they seriously interfere with business operations. In a few cases, they may be so costly as to be prohibitive, and cause the company to abandon an otherwise sound business transaction that is clearly in the best interest of the corporation and the businesses it operates. 
There is no tax policy reason, tax advisors agree, to require the reorganization of a consolidated group that is clearly engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, as a condition to a spinoff. Nor is there any reason to treat affiliated groups differently than single operating companies. Indeed, no one has ever suggested one. The legislative history indicates Congress was concerned about noncontrolled subsidiaries, which is elsewhere adequately addressed, not consolidated groups. 
For many purposes, the Tax Code treats affiliated groups as a single corporation. Therefore, the simple remedy I am proposing today for the problem created by the awkward language of section 355(b)(2)(A) is to apply the active business test to an affiliated group as if it were a single entity.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2341, the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, introduced by Senator DeWine, myself and twenty-nine of our distinguished colleagues. 
Research shows that increased Federal, State and local efforts are needed to enforce the already existing laws, as well as to pass pro-active legislation to deal with ever changing trends in substance abuse. Unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that over the past decade the changing trends indicate that drug use has increased, particularly among young people. My colleagues and I believe that the growth in drug use has some connection to the decline in resources dedicated to drug interdiction efforts outside our borders over this period. While previous budgets have appropriately devoted resources to demand and domestic law enforcement programs, evidence also shows that there must be a returned focus on interdiction and eradication programs. I have continued to support a continued federal commitment to demand reduction and law enforcement programs since ultimately these activities drive the drug trade in the United States. However, we can not reverse the disturbing increases in drug use unless we also dedicate more funds to drug interdiction and restore a more balanced drug control strategy. 
Mr. President, I believe that this $2.6 billion over 3 years initiative to enhance international eradication, interdiction and crop substitution efforts targets the threat to the United States caused by drug lords. Furthermore, by addressing the very highlights of the bill and appropriating the necessary monies, drug lords and drug traffickers will be more clearly targeted. While this bill is very detailed, let me mention a few of the highlights: 
It would improve our aircraft, maritime and radar coverage of both drug-source and drug-transit countries; 
It would enhance drug-eradication and interdiction efforts in source countries; 
It would enhance the development of alternative crops in drug-source countries; It would support international law enforcement training; 
It would enhance law enforcement interdiction operations. 
Mr. President, all too often, the drug smugglers have the upper hand with state-of-the-art boats and aircraft. I might add the United States specifically lacks adequate surface assets and is using aircraft with 1990 technology. I believe that this bill will help turn the tide in the war on drugs by equipping the Coast Guard, Customs, DEA, DOD and other law enforcement agencies with the latest in proven technology. 
Mr. President, I want my colleagues to take note of the fact that an identical bill H.R.4300 has already been passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 384-39. I urge my colleagues to support the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and make it far more difficult for drug lords to bring drugs to our nation. I believe that increasing funds for eradication and interdiction efforts will make a difference.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill cosponsored by Senators Mack and Faircloth entitled the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1998. This bill will attempt to stop a very troubling problem facing America's marine manufacturers--the unauthorized copying of boat hull designs. Such piracy threatens the integrity of the United States marine manufacturing industry and the safety of American boaters. 
A boat manufacturer invests significant resources in creating a safe, structurally sound, high performance boat hull design from which a line of vessels can be manufactured. Standard practice calls for manufacturing engineers to create a hull model, or `plug', from which they cast a `mold'. This mold is then used for mass production of boat hulls. Unfortunately, those intent on pirating such a design can simply use a finished boat hull to develop their own mold. This copied mold can then be used to manufacture boat hulls identical in appearance to the original line, and at a cost well below that incurred by the original designer. 
This so-called `hull splashing' is a significant problem for consumers, manufacturers, and boat design firms. American consumers are defrauded in the sense that they do not benefit from the many aspects of the original hull design that contribute to its structural integrity and safety, and they are not aware that the boat they have purchased has been copied from an existing design. Moreover, if original manufacturers are undersold by these copies, they may no longer be willing to invest in new, innovative boat designs--boat designs that could provide safer, less expensive, quality watercraft for consumers. 
In the past, a number of States have enacted anti-boat-hull-copying, or `plug mold', statutes to address the problem of hull splashing. These States include my State of Louisiana, as well as Alabama, California, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. However, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141 (1989), invalidated these State statutes on the basis that they infringed on the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over the protection of intellectual property. In essence, the Supreme Court held that vessel hull design protection may be a legitimate goal, but it is Congress' job to provide it, not the States. The legislation we are introducing today is designed to do that job. 
Such initiatives as this one are not new to Congress. In 1984, Congress acted to protect the unique nature of design work when it passed the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act. This act was designed to protect the mask works of semiconductor chips, which are essentially the molds from which the chips are made, against unauthorized duplication. I believe that the approach Congress took in that legislation should also be applied to protect boat hull designs. The Boat Protection Act of 1998 would work in concert with current federal law to protect American marine manufacturers from harmful and unfair competition. 
Mr. President, I want my colleagues to take note of the fact that an identical bill, H.R. 2696, has already been passed in the House of Representatives by unanimous consent. I want to urge my colleagues to support the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1998 and to join in this effort to protect the American public and the marine manufacturing community from the dangers and impropriety of hull splashing.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is interesting. During the time I have been in the Senate and Congress, a lot of times when you don't have the facts on your side you have to create an enemy and talk about the enemy. I think this is exactly the case here. It is easy to find an enemy in the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry are the first people in the world to admit that they, on any kind of a popularity chart, would probably be right at the bottom--or probably right above the Members of Congress. The oil industry right in front of us, and we would be at the bottom. 
The point is, if you do not have the facts, you have to get somebody to argue against, somebody who people don't generally like. And I agree, people don't generally like oil and gas companies. So, let's make them the big bogeyman in this and argue about how bad they are. Fortunately, that is not the issue in this case. The issue in this case is really very simple. The issue is, how do you determine the proper value for oil that is discovered on Federal lands, and what is the royalty that companies who explore and develop should pay the Federal Government? It is very clear that companies do not determine how much they have to pay--we do. We passed the OCS Lands Act in 1976 and innumerable other Federal acts in Congress to determine what royalties should be. Congress makes that decision and we have made it many times. 
The question before the Interior Department in which they, I think, made a mistake is how do you determine the value of the oil. We know what the percentage is. Interestingly, companies made a proposal to the Federal Government and said let us quit fighting over what the value of the oil is; let us just give you the oil. If you are entitled to 15 percent of the oil, and we have 100 barrels, let us just give you 15 barrels of oil and let you go sell it and you determine what the price is by selling it in the marketplace. 
The Federal Government said we don't want to do that. We think that is too complicated--and it is complicated. The problem before this Congress is what do we do, in trying to work with the Interior Department, in helping to determine what is the proper value. How do we find the proper value for oil? 
Someone said we ought to have hearings on this. We did. We had a hearing. We had two hearings. We had hearings in the Senate Energy Committee. We had hearings in the House Resources Committee. Minerals Management Service came and testified, members of the oil and gas industry came and testified and talked about how they were trying to work this problem out. I also hosted, along with Senator Hutchison from Texas, Senators Domenici and Bingaman from New Mexico and Senator Landrieu from my State and others, meetings between oil industry representatives and Interior officials to try to get them to sit at the same table and try to come to a resolution of the very complicated technical problem of determining how do you find out what the proper value of a barrel of oil. 
The oil is brought to the surface in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. You can determine what the price is, if you look at what it is at the wellhead. One problem in this proposed rule is that we look at different prices and at a different time to determine the value. We don't look at what its value is in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, but we look at it after it is brought onshore. How do you determine what are the legitimate transportation deductions in reaching the royalty value of crude oil? And, should companies have to pay all of the costs to this point onshore. If it is the Government's oil, shouldn't the Government pay the transportation cost of its share? Therefore, one of the real conflicts is how do you determine a proper transportation deduction? 
Companies will argue that the entire pipeline system is part of the cost of transporting oil. They say, `If we do not have this elaborate system out there, we cannot transport it to the place onshore where the Government takes ownership, so that should be deductible.' Minerals Management says `No, you should not deduct all of that; it should be less.' So this is a battle of what you should deduct and how you reach a legitimate price. There is nothing mysterious about this. Nobody is trying to rob anyone of anything. 
Oil and gas companies have paid more in royalties to the Federal Government than they have received in the price of oil they have taken from the Federal lands in terms of taxes they have paid and royalties that they have paid over the years since we have had an offshore oil and gas industry--companies have paid more to the U.S. Treasury than they have made in finding oil in the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, in the future, it will turn around. They will start making more money than they have paid. That is why they are in the business. Up until this point they have still paid more to the Federal Treasury in royalties and taxes and benefits to the U.S. Government than they have made in selling the oil that they have found. 
We tried to have meetings with Minerals Management Service to resolve this. This rider is not the best way to handle it. I would admit that. But I think it is appropriate that when Congress sees something happening that is not consistent with what is good policy and what is the law, then Congress has an obligation to say `hold it,' `stop,' `slowdown,' `let's continue to try to work this out.' That is exactly what an appropriation rider has done. We have told Interior Department, in the Interior appropriations bill, that this rule is fundamentally flawed. It is not correct. It is not right. It does not allow for the legitimate deductions in the costs of transportation that should be allowed, and therefore don't go forward with a rule that is fundamentally flawed. Give Congress and the Interior Department time to come to an agreement on what is appropriate and proper. 
That is the argument. That is the issue. We can talk about how bad the oil companies are. That is a easy thing to say if you don't like oil companies. I happen to like them. They employ hundreds of thousands of people in my State and provide the energy for people to drive to work in the morning. It is part of our national economic security and part of the national defense in our country. They do an important service for this country of ours. So the issue is not whether or not you like oil companies. The issue is very simple, Is this a good rule? The answer is no. Should it be stopped? The answer is yes. Should this amendment be tabled? The answer is also yes. I think when this amendment is tabled it will allow the administration and the Department to continue to work with those who are interested in trying to resolve this and come to a resolution that makes sense. Companies will continue to pay. 
It is interesting, when they had the hearings over in the House, when the administration testified concerning this argument about how much we are losing in lost revenue. The Director of the Minerals Management Service, when she testified at the House Resources Committee on February 26, 1998, said that these regulations `are intended to simplify the royalty payments, make valuation methods reflective of modern market conditions, offer the industry more flexibility, reduce administrative costs, and maintain revenue neutrality.' 
When MMS proposed the rule, as flawed as it was, it wasn't to increase the amount of money they would get. At least that is what they said. It is simply to `maintain revenue neutrality.' Now the argument is we are losing millions of dollars every month. The whole purpose of the rule was to make the way we determine the value of the oil simpler and reflect modern market conditions. It doesn't do that. Therefore we should say stop, slowdown, let's continue to negotiate to come up with something that makes sense. 
That is what the bill before the Senate does. It should not be changed, and the amendment should be tabled. 
I yield back the time to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce a very important bill for small businesses and the self-employed in Louisiana and throughout our country. My bill would restore the 80 percent deduction for business meals and entertainment expenses, thus eliminating a tax burden that has seriously hampered many small businesses in our country. 
Small business is a powerful economic engine, both nationwide and in Louisiana. Small businesses have helped to create the prosperity that we have all enjoyed in the last few years. They are leaders in the innovation and technology development that will sustain our economy in the 21st century. Nationwide, small business employs 53 percent of the private work force, contributes 47 percent of all sales in the country, and is responsible for 50 percent of the private gross domestic product. 
For these reasons, I believe the tax code should encourage, not discourage, small business development and growth. For the more than 225,000 self-employed and for the thousands of small businesses in Louisiana, business meals and entertainment take the place of advertising, marketing, and conference meetings. These expenses are a core business development cost. As such, a large percentage of these costs should be deductible. 
For many years, businesses were allowed to deduct 100 percent of business meals and entertainment expenses. In 1987, this deduction was reduced to 80 percent. The deduction was further reduced in 1994 to 50 percent because of the misconception that these meals were `three martini lunches.' 
Contrary to this perception, studies show that the primary beneficiary of the business meal deduction is not the wealthy business person. Studies indicate that over two-thirds of the business meal spenders have incomes of less than $60,000 and 37 percent have incomes below $40,000. Low to moderately priced restaurants are the most popular types for business meals, with the average check equaling less than $20. In addition, 50 percent of most business meals occur in small towns and rural areas. 
In 1995, just one year after the deduction was reduced to 50 percent, the White House Conference on Small Business established the restoration of the deduction as one of its top priorities for boosting small business. In Louisiana alone, it is expected that the positive economic impact of this proposal could exceed $67 million in industries, such as the travel and restaurant industry, that employ over 120,000 people. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. BREAUX. Thank you for the time. 
I make one point very quickly, and the point is this: Our friends in agriculture in the northern part of the United States have a problem: They have a crop but they have a very poor price that doesn't allow them to continue. They need help. That is why the loan level is being increased--to try to help those. 
For those of us who represent the southern areas, our problem is the opposite: Because of the drought, we don't have any crop. It is not a question of local price. There is no crop to sell at any price. 
One of the sections that is in this bill says that the Secretary may use funds made available under this section to make cash payments that don't go for crop disasters but for income loss. 
Now, as a representative of an area that has a crop disaster, it seems to me I am being written out of any help at all. If that is the case, I would like to know about it. 
Maybe my friend from North Dakota can respond, and I yield to him.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will not take a long time. I know the hour is late. But there are still very important issues that I think Congress needs to pay attention to and to address. I know that all of the news in Washington today has been generally about the problems of the President. While I understand that, it is also very important, I think, for all of us to realize that we cannot pretend to be ostriches and stick our heads in the sand, and not face other very serious problems that many of our constituents are facing around this country. 
I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention the very serious agricultural disasters that exist as we stand here in Washington today throughout a large portion of the agricultural belt in the United States of America. It is a serious problem. We cannot allow the problems of the moment to distract us from very important duties that we have, as legislators, to do everything within our power to try to help solve the problems of America's farmers. 
It is really interesting, because while the farmers are having problems throughout the United States, there are different reasons for the disasters which I would like to point out. 
In the northern and many of the western parts of the country--the northwestern part of our United States--the problems in agriculture are very simple--they have very low prices for their products--while in the South, in the Southwest, and in my State of Louisiana, the problem is also very simple to understand: It is not that the crops have low prices but, rather, that they have no crops. They have no crops because of the drought conditions that have caused an economic, agricultural, farming disaster. 
While the reasons for the problems for the farmers are quite different, the results are the same. Whether you are a farmer in the northern part of the United States who can't get enough money for your crop to justify your cost of production, or whether you are a farmer in my State of Louisiana, which has no crop because of the extreme drought that has ravaged my State, the end result of the farmer and the family farm is the same; it is loss of income; it is loss of the ability to continue as a family farm. What happens to a family farm affects not only that family farm but it affects the community that they live in. When farmers suffer economic loss, the entire State suffers as well.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I wish to make some comments this morning on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights which we have had so much discussion and dialogue about in recent months. 
As we all know in this body, the House of Representatives has actually passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. The fact that one chamber has passed legislation is the encouraging news. That is the good news. The bad news is that the Senate may not do anything about it. I think that would be unfortunate for all Americans who are concerned about making sure that their families, their children, have adequate access to quality health care in this country. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights, as I said, is now pending in the Senate. The battle now becomes: Do we bring it up? How do we bring it up? What happens to it? Are we going to let election year politics determine the fate of this very important piece of health care legislation? 
All of this reminds me of something we just went through not too long ago. For 4 or 5 weeks the Senate debated a tobacco bill. Do we all remember that? Do we all remember what happened to it? It never passed. It never passed because both sides were not able to get together and bridge the gap between what I consider to be relatively minor differences between the various pieces of legislation and we started blaming each other for its failure. So now we are arguing about whose fault it is that it failed instead of debating the issue of who should get credit for getting it passed. 
I think it is incredibly more important politically and for the good of this country to be able to argue about success and argue about who should get the credit for accomplishing something rather than arguing about failure and whose fault it is that nothing got done. I have a feeling that we are moving in that same direction when it comes to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Are we all going to go home and blame each other for failure? Or are we going to be able to go back home and say we got together and got something accomplished? I think the latter course of action is much better. 
I was disturbed reading the Washington Post yesterday. There was a short article entitled `Plans to Regulate HMOs Unlikely to Reach a Vote in the Senate.' That is very disturbing, I think, for all Members who come here in order to pass legislation and do what is appropriate and proper for their constituents. 
Even with the little time remaining this session, I think there is a way out of this logjam. I think that many of the issues in the various Patients' Bill of Rights are things that we can reach an agreement on if we are serious about getting a bill passed this year. We need to talk about the information that patients should have and the disclosures health plan should make. We can work that out. We need to talk about access to specialists and pediatricians and direct access for women to their ob/gyn. We can work that out. There are differences in those areas but we should be able to find some common ground on them. 
We need to talk about a prudent layperson standard for patients who seek care in emergency rooms: When a person goes to the emergency room thinking they're having a heart attack and they find out it is not that bad, should the insurance company be allowed to deny payment? We can work that out by discussing a prudent layperson standard that ensures that managed companies have to pay for that treatment. If the patient thought their health was 
in serious jeopardy, the health insurance plan should, in fact, have to pay for that treatment. 
We need to talk about an end to gag rules which prohibit doctors from telling their patients all of the treatment options that are available to them. We should put an end to gag rules once and for all. We can work that out. 
It seems to me that the most controversial obstacle right now is the issue of whether to expand the right of patients to sue their health plan in state court. One side says we don't want to open up the courts to more litigation. Most of our Republican colleagues have taken a position that patients in ERISA plans should not have a right to sue their managed care plans for damages in state court. 
On the other hand, there are others who say, no, you have to have access to a state court, you have to have the right to litigate if a patient is denied coverage or is otherwise harmed by a decision their plan makes. Principally people on my side of the aisle have taken that position. 
While there are differences on many provisions in the various Patients' Bill of Rights, the liability issue seems to be the biggest bottleneck that is preventing this bill from even being considered after it already passed the House. That is unfortunate. If we don't break that logjam, we will go home arguing about whose fault it is that nothing was passed. We can argue about whose fault it was tobacco didn't pass. We can argue about whose fault it was the Patients' Bill of Rights didn't pass. We can argue about whose fault it was appropriations bills weren't passed. We will go home arguing about who should be blamed for failure and not getting anything done for the people who sent us here. 
I suggest that there is a way of bridging the gap with a realistic compromise that gets the job done for people concerned about patients' rights. I think the approach I suggest makes a great deal of sense. 
There are some managed care plans now, such as Ochsner Health Plan in Louisiana, the largest HMO in the state, that have an external review process for patients who disagree with a plan's decision. There are some plans around the country that do that already for their managed care patients. They have voluntarily established--there is no law that requires it, but they have voluntarily established a procedure where you have an external review if the patient is denied coverage by a health plan. It works very well. But private health plans are not required to have an internal and external appeals process available to their enrollees and most don't. 
However, when you talk about the right to sue as being the solution, I really question that. Suppose you are a patient and your health plan says we will not pay for a bone marrow transplant, so someone says, all right, you have the right to sue. The patient will be dead and gone and buried before the litigation is completed, in many cases. That right to sue does not help a person who is in an emergency situation and needs a decision right away. For the vast majority of patients, having access to an internal and external appeals process would prevent the need to go to court in the first place. An external appeals process in particular would give patients the right to have their case heard by an independent, outside panel of experts who have no financial or other connection to the health plan. 
I suggest that a compromise can be found by looking at the appeals process that already exists for Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. About 6 million of the 38 million people in Medicare are in some form of managed care. There is a procedure already established by Congress for these beneficiaries when they are denied coverage by their HMO. There is a procedure in place that works. It has been called the gold standard of the appeals process. It is not perfect. Sure, there are problems with the system such as monitoring and enforcement. Even with a good appeals system in place, patients have to know that an appeals process is available to them, how it works and how to access it. I've recently asked the GAO to review Medicare's internal and external appeals processes to determine whether it needs to be improved. But the Medicare appeals process that Congress put in place works well for beneficiaries overall. I suggest that in an effort to bring this Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor and get something passed, to resolve the impasse between no right to sue and absolute right to sue, we should look for a middle ground by taking what we have in Medicare and using it as model for private health plans. 
We can do that very simply. In fact, I have an amendment drafted that, if a bill comes up, I would like to offer what I think could bridge the gap on this issue. 
Here is generally how the Medicare appeals process works: Health plans have 14 calendar days to make an initial coverage determination for routine matters. If it is an emergency, a real emergency, the Medicare HMO has to make a determination within 72 hours. That is the first step the insurance company must take in this process. If the plan decides to pay for the treatment, that is the end of it, the patient gets the care. But if a patient is denied coverage after this initial decision made by the company, then the beneficiary or his doctor can request an internal review, and it is an internal review by the company. If it is an emergency, they have to reconsider their decision within 72 hours. If it is a nonemergency, they have 30 days to reconsider their original decision. If they reverse their original decision, that is it, no more appeal, the patient is covered. If a patient is still denied coverage after the internal review by the company, then the patient can access an external appeals process. The external appeals process is done by a panel of outside experts, not by the company. These outside experts are people who have no financial interest in the decision and who look at the case and make a decision. If it is an emergency, the external reviewers have to render a decision within 72 hours. If it is a nonemergency, they have 30 days in which to decide. This is an external review--not by the insurance company, not by the carrier, not by anybody who has a financial interest in the outcome of this decision. Outside, independent experts make that decision. If they find in favor of the patient, that is it. There is no further appeal by the health plan. 
If the external reviewers find against a patient and say, no, the HMO does not have to pay for that treatment, that patient still has step 4, which is an administrative appeal. That is an appeal to an Administrative Law Judge at the Social Security Administration. The Administrative Law Judge then can make a decision based on what they think the plan provides, whether it is covered or whether it is not covered. If the Administrative Law Judge rules against the Medicare beneficiary, the beneficiary can appeal the decision to the Departmental Appeals Board at the Social Security Administration. 
Then, there is a fifth step in the process if the Administrative Law Judge or Appeals Board finds in favor of the plan and against the beneficiary. If the patient is denied coverage by the Administrative Law Judge, that patient still has the right to judicial review in U.S. district court where he can push his case and plead that the procedure be covered. He can't sue for damages; he can't sue for punitive damages, or compensatory damages, but he can sue for coverage. If it is a bone marrow transplant, he could sue for the cost of that procedure, or an MRI, or whatever the procedure would be. This is what we do for Medicare. This is what Congress has helped establish for the 15 percent of Medicare patients who are now in HMOs. It is already in existence and in statute and it works. 
A good thing about this, in addition to the fact that it is already there and we know how it works, is that it prevents most of the cases from ever having to go to court in the first place. Either the first, second, or the third level of review solves the problem, and it is done in a timely fashion. Does anybody think they can go to court and get a decision within 72 hours? You could not even file the papers within 72 hours. You would have depositions, hearings, a trial, an appeal, and then it gets kicked back down, and the patient has died, and you are still litigating whether they should be covered or not. That is not necessarily a good procedure. 
What I am suggesting to those who say, `Don't allow suits' and to those who say, `You have to have suits in this Patients' Bill of Rights,' is that there is a middle ground that makes sense. I ask all of my colleagues just to consider that we are so close to the end of this session and neither side is going to get everything it wants; it is just not going to happen. If we hold out for everything we want and not try to compromise, we are going to go home and argue about failure because nothing will pass. There is a better way to serve the people and that is, I suggest, to say on this question of what rights to give patients when they are denied coverage, let's take what we already do in the Medicare Program and establish that as the procedure to be used for managed care plans in the private sector. While it needs some fine-tuning, it works; it has a proven track record. It is not perfect, but it certainly is better than what patients have right now because, in most cases, patients do not have the right to any kind of internal or external appeal if coverage is denied. I suggest that this makes a great deal of sense and could help resolve part of this problem. We can bring this bill up to the floor next week, adopt this amendment, and then ultimately send this to the President, who I think would be certainly willing to sign something that may not be 100 percent what he wants, maybe not 100 percent of what anyone wants, but it is 100 percent more than we are going to get if we do nothing. This is a suggestion that I hope our colleagues will seriously consider. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Sense of the Senate offered by Senator Kerrey and accepted tonight by unanimous consent regarding payroll tax relief. 
We keep hearing the good news about surpluses but of the $1.55 trillion surplus over the next decade, all but $32 billion comes from the social security trust fund--from payroll taxes paid by working Americans on their wages--taxes that American workers paid to insure the viability of their Social Security benefits. 
Of families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. The payroll tax is the most regressive tax in America, disproportionately burdening low income families. Remember that almost 50 percent of households in this country earn under $35,000 per year and most of this income is from wages which are subject to the payroll tax. Given these facts, the payroll tax cut is clearly the tax cut this Congress should be discussing. 
And we should be discussing it along with the reforms necessary to fix Social Security for all Americans for all time. I know there are many Senators here who share my sentiments. I served with Senator Gregg on a bipartisan commission that thorougly studied this issue and we have recommended a comprehensive reform package. Senator Kerrey and Senator Moynihan have been working on a bill. Others in this bodies are also working on social security reforms. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to not only reduce taxes but to shore up social security and create wealth for working Americans.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator Gregg, the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies, Senator Hollings, the Subcommittee's distinguished Ranking Member, and Senator Landrieu, my distinguished colleague from Louisiana, concerning an important public safety matter in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. 
As my colleagues know, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office has gained attention as one of our nation's most innovative and accomplished law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, the Sheriff's Office's has been stymied in the past by a grossly inadequate and outdated conventional 450 MHz UHF radio system that has threatened public safety. It simply cannot provide the secure and varied communications capabilities needed by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office in order for it to communicate with various state and federal law enforcement agencies. 
To meet its operational needs, the Sheriff's Department has pursued the purchase of a new 800 MHz communications system. This new system will enable the Sheriff's Office to maintain a high and secure level of communication with district personnel and others. Through better communication, each officer can patrol his or her reporting areas more effectively. The new system will also enable the Sheriff's Office to successfully communicate with residents and other public safety officials during emergency situations, such as natural disasters, which require coordination of state and federal efforts. 
I would like to thank the Subcommittee for recognizing the importance of this project and for providing partial funding for this initiative in last year's appropriations bill. Unfortunately, Congress only provided half of what the Sheriff's Office needs to complete the new communications system. Now is the time for Congress to finish its commitment to fund this project.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I call to the Senate's attention the serious and significant drought which has occurred in Louisiana this year. The combination of a prolonged lack of rainfall and persistent high temperatures have resulted in a natural disaster of historic proportions. For those affected, damages have been hard-hitting. 
As we debate the 1999 agricultural appropriations bill and amendments to it which respond to severe agricultural distress throughout the nation this year, caused by weather-related damages and low commodity prices, I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the situation in Louisiana. 
On June 18 of this year, Governor M.J. `Mike' Foster and Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Bob Odom wrote to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman about the drought in Louisiana. 
Though adequate production records were not yet available at the time of their letter, Governor Foster and Commissioner Odom told Secretary Glickman substantial losses were expected in the state and that they expected to be requesting a disaster declaration as soon as adequate production information could be obtained. 
Various row crops and pine and hardwood seedlings have been affected in Louisiana by the drought, they said. Cattle have been affected because of severe hay and pasture shortages. Poultry losses also have occurred due to the high temperatures. 
Illustrative of the drought's historic character, they pointed out that records have been set for the least amount of rainfall received in the month of May, with rainfall records going back more than 100 years. 
Though Congressionally-authorized programs are in place at USDA to respond to disasters, I urge the Senate to be prepared to respond further and promptly as conditions and impacts would worsen. 
Mr. President, we know that production disruptions brought about by the drought will cause economic disruptions for producers. In addition, the communities in which our producers live also will be affected. It is for these reasons that I urge close attention to crop disasters and low prices and a readiness to act as warranted.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the efforts of Gerard and Myriam Ubaghs of Margraten, Netherlands, who have cared for the graves of American servicemen killed in the line of duty during World War II. In September of 1944, the United States Army reached the German frontier and entered the Netherlands near the city of Maastricht. By September 13, 1944, the troops of the U.S. 30th Infantry Division liberated part of eastern Holland, freeing the area from the grip of Nazi Germany. During the battle, 8,302 soldiers lost their lives including American servicemen from every state in the Union. 
I, as well as all American citizens, am truly thankful for the bravery, valor, and patriotism shown by our soldiers who fought and died for their country on that day and every day of World War II. These servicemen not only gave their lives for their country, but also died for the people of the Netherlands. For this, the citizens of the Netherlands have been and remain truly grateful to the fallen soldiers of the U.S. Army. 
One manifestation of their appreciation is their care for the Netherlands American Cemetery in the town of Margraten, in the Limburg Province of the Netherlands. This cemetery is the only one of its kind in the Netherlands. It was established in November of 1944 and free use of the land as a permanent burial ground was granted, without charge or taxation by the government of the Netherlands. The cemetery occupies 65.5 acres and includes a 101 foot-tall tower, a Court of Honor, a chapel and a reflecting pool. Among the 8,302 graves lie the remains of American, English, Canadian and Mexican troops. 
I would like to thank not only the people of the Netherlands for this cemetery, but two individuals in particular who have honored our fallen servicemen for fifty-three years. They are Gerard and Myriam Ubaghs. As children, after the liberation of their town by American troops, they adopted and cared for two graves until the bodies were identified and returned to the United States. To this day, they continue to honor our fallen soldiers and express much gratitude to America. 
I would like to officially acknowledge the Ubaghs and the people of Margraten, and thank them for their gracious deeds and for honoring our fallen soldiers. Their service is a reminder to all of us how the efforts of such brave soldiers on a day more than fifty years ago effects people around the world even today.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which I believe will help achieve the development of a United States cruise vessel industry and generate numerous economic benefits for our country through the operation of United States-flag cruise vessels between American ports. 
There is little doubt that we should take significant and innovative action so that American ports, businesses and workers can share in the economic benefits that can be realized through the operation of cruise vessels in the United States domestic trade. 
Recently, the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine held an oversight hearing on the need to generate cruise vessel operations between American ports. In fact, as a result of the hearing, many of our colleagues, including the Chairman of our Commerce Committee Senator McCain, are committed to moving forward on cruise vessel legislation this year so our port economies throughout the country can begin to benefit through cruise vessel operations. 
As strongly as I am committed to helping ports in my state of Louisiana and throughout our country to attract and benefit from increased cruise vessel operations, I am equally convinced that we will not achieve the full measure of these economic benefits if we simply allow foreign flag passenger vessels to operate between America's ports. Rather, I believe we should be directing our efforts to develop a large, modern and competitive cruise vessel fleet comprised of vessels built in the United States, operated under the United States-flag, and crewed by United States citizens. Otherwise, we would simply be allowing foreign companies and foreign workers to receive all the privileges and benefits that come with operating in the United States domestic trade without any of the associated and resultant obligations and responsibilities we impose on American companies and American workers. 
The legislation I am introducing today is intended to reflect the economic realities facing companies seeking to enter the domestic cruise trade and the desire of American ports to attract cruise vessels as quickly as possible. It will jumpstart the domestic cruise vessel industry by allowing American companies to acquire foreign built cruise vessels and operate those ships in the domestic cruise trade under very specific and limited circumstances. These vessels will be documented under the laws of the United States, run with American citizen crews, and operated in compliance with all applicable United States laws, regulations and tax obligations. 
My legislation reflects the principles embodied in our Nation's cabotage laws while recognizing that a waiver of the Passenger Vessel Services Act, under specific terms and conditions, is absolutely necessary to attract United States-flag cruise vessels into our domestic trades. 
Especially significant is the fact that in order to take advantage of the authority to operate such vessels in the domestic trades, the owner must agree, and my legislation requires, that they will first enter into a contract to build a replacement vessel or vessels in a United States shipyard. 
I share the desire of Senator McCain and our colleagues to develop legislation that will immediately and dramatically increase domestic cruise vessel operations. However, I am convinced that we should not let this present opportunity pass by--we have a legitimate opportunity to increase the size of the oceangoing United States-flag cruise vessel fleet and to greatly increase the opportunity for American ports to attract and benefit from cruise vessel activity. I am aware of at least one American company ready to take advantage of this legislation, acquire two modern, attractive, large cruise vessels and operate them under the United States-flag under the terms and conditions set forth in my proposal. 
I ask all my colleagues to join with me in support of this proposal so we can achieve the operation and construction of United States-flag cruise vessels.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take this time on the floor to inform my colleagues, and others who may have an interest in the fact, that the Medicare Commission will be having a field hearing on Monday coming outside of Washington in Minneapolis, MN. 
As always, it is the intention of myself as chairman of the Medicare Commission, along with my colleague from the House, Bill Thomas, and all of the commission members, that we need to get as much information from outside of Washington about the Medicare problem as we possibly can. 
This effort in bringing the commission to the city of Minneapolis, MN, on Monday for a rather very, very full agenda of activities in Minneapolis relating to Medicare is to give all of us an opportunity to gather information, which will be extremely important in helping us make the very difficult but extremely important recommendations that we are required by Congress to make to the President, and also to the Congress by March 1st of this coming year. 
Our hearing will consist of a site visit in the morning where commissioners will choose from one of four sites, three of which will have the direct interaction with Medicare beneficiaries. I would like to cover some of the sites that we will be visiting so people will know exactly what this commission is going to be doing. 
We will have a chance to visit the Wilder Senior Services Clinic, which is a Minnesota Senior Health Options Clinic, which is really a demonstration program now being run by the Minnesota Department of Human Services. It serves seniors who find themselves in the unique position of being eligible for Medicare, and also being eligible for Medicaid at the same time. These people are so-called dual beneficiaries who can get their health coverage from two separate programs. And how this particular operation is handling it is something that I think we can benefit from seeing. 
The second site visit that we are going to take the commission to is a Fairview University Medicare Center, the Mayo Clinic, the world famous medical institution in Minneapolis, where our commissioners will have the opportunity to really tour an integrated care clinical site and observe telemedicine demonstrations with the Mayo Clinic in a rural facility outside of the city, and also a visit with providers and beneficiaries and also administrators. 
Third, the commissioners will be able to also visit Medtronic, which develops and manufacturers medical devices to treat cardiovascular and neurological disorders. 
The idea is to tour these facilities to look at the impact that new technology, of which the United States is a world leader in producing, has on the future of Medicare. 
Clearly, as we are able to produce more sophisticated equipment facilities to treat health care beneficiaries in this country, it is going to have a direct effect on the Medicare Program, and hopefully for the better. 
The final site visit opportunity we will be taking is the United Health Care Research Center, an Institute for Health Care Quality, where we will tour their facilities and learn about how United Health Care gathers and analyzes patient data to evaluate medical outcomes and cost-effectiveness as a treatment. 
It is very important that we study how various forms of health care affect outcomes, both from a health standpoint, as well as from a cost standpoint. 
Then, beginning at noon at the Minneapolis Convention Center, our commissioners will then hear from people who will make presentations to our committee in the form of three panels. 
The first panel we will hear from is the Buyers Health Care Action Group, which is interestingly a coalition of 27 large, Twin-Cities-based self-insured employers--companies like 3M, General Mills, and Honeywell. 
This panel hopefully will give the commission an opportunity to hear from private companies regarding how they purchase health care for their employees and what the result has been for their employees, as well as what the results have been for their companies. 
The second panel will be a panel of managed care plans to talk about their experience in the managed care market in Minneapolis, which has had managed care around longer than most places in the country. 
With the debate on Medicare both in the Congress and in the public in general I think it is important that we look at some of them and try to understand better how they are working in providing quality health care and reduced costs for Medicare beneficiaries. 
The third and last panel we will hear from is current and future beneficiaries on information that they need and use in making health care decisions. It is really important with the new proposal coming out of the Health Care Financing Authority, HCFA, coming October 1st. Medicare is not going to be like it used to be. People who are Medicare beneficiaries are going to get some choice options. They are going to have different decisions to make about whether they want to go into managed care. 
It is very important for seniors and their families to understand that grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, and others are going to have to make some different decisions about their health care. While this can be a little bit frightening, I think we should look upon it as a real opportunity to give them more choice and ultimately better services than they currently get under Medicare. 
We can be very proud of what Medicare has done. Medicare is not that great a plan in the 1990s. It doesn't provide eyeglass coverage; it doesn't provide prescription drugs; it doesn't provide long-term health care. Most beneficiaries think it is a wonderful program, and, indeed, it is. But it is not nearly as good as most health plans in the country today that are private plans which provide generally a lot more benefits to the beneficiaries than Medicare does. 
So we are going to be looking at how people get their information and what information they need in order to make these choices. 
The rest of the afternoon is going to be devoted to public interest, to really have the commission sit and listen to Mr. and Mrs. America and tell us what they would like to see in Medicare for the future. 
We have 2 hours set aside for audience participation. We call this session a `Call for Solutions' where we have invited ordinary citizens from the Minnesota region and area to submit their ideas and recommendations for improving Medicare. 
In addition to the field hearing that we will be having in Minneapolis, we will also be continuing to explore other ways to get input from the public. We don't have to visit every city and every State and every county in America to hear from America. In this century, as we move to the 21st century, we are going to be making use of teleconferencing, video conferencing. Commission meetings that we have had so far have been covered in full by C-SPAN. We have a national web site. We have had 13 commission and task force meetings since March 6th, all of which have been open to the public for their information. 
I think we have a very ambitious schedule, as I have just outlined, for the Monday field hearings in Minneapolis. 
I urge my colleagues to continue to be mindful of what we are attempting to do. If they have suggestions, we are open to receiving those suggestions. 
Hopefully, we will have their participation as we draft recommendations for the full Congress and for the President, so we can make the reforms necessary to preserve, protect, and even, indeed, improve Medicare for future generations. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order a quorum is not present.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the IRS Reform Act, which is now on the floor. This is indeed, in my opinion, a very historic day. Never before in the history of the Internal Revenue Service have we ever had legislation that brought about massive changes to an institution that is not thought of too well by the American people. This legislation goes far beyond anything that Congress has ever done in trying to reform the Internal Revenue Service. 
I want to join with others in commending a couple of people for the work they have done, particularly the chairman of our committee, the distinguished Senator Roth, who chaired the hearings, which really woke up a number of Members of Congress to the massive problems that were out there. It was really very moving to hear American citizens come in and actually tell about their experiences and the abuses they had suffered as a result of the Internal Revenue Service. 
I would, I think, fairly and properly add, however, that the vast majority of the people who both work for and work at the IRS are good, honest, decent citizens of this country, who are very loyal to what America stands for and respect the rights of taxpayers in this country. But as in any institution, whether it be government or private, there are abuses. What the hearings were able to do was to lay out in a public forum the problems with the current bureaucracy that represents the Internal Revenue Service. 
I want to commend, in addition to Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan for the work he has been doing, and I think Senator Hutchinson was proper in pointing out also the work done by a former Member of this body who used to sit right about over there on the Democratic side, a member of the Democratic leadership, David Pryor. He is not with us today, he is residing in Arkansas, but he is with us in spirit in the sense that we are discussing today something that he started a long, long time ago with his Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
Long before the Roth hearings, David Pryor was working on this particular problem in bringing our attention to the defects that the IRS had. He always stood up for the individual taxpayers of America. I know that wherever he is in Arkansas, or wherever today, he is justifiably proud of the work that is being done today because he led the way in that area. 
The final person is Senator Kerrey in this body from the great State of Nebraska who chaired an IRS reform commission. As one who chairs a commission right now, I know how difficult it is to try to get people to agree and make recommendations on how to reform legislation. Many times a commission has so many experts on it that it is difficult to get any kind of consensus about change. But Senator Kerrey led the way in getting a commission to focus in on this problem and help produce legislation and recommendations. Without his work on the committee itself this product would not be in the good shape that it is in today. 
I am reminded of the old stories, which are repeated in Louisiana. You have various versions of this. One of them heard is about the two greatest lies ever told. The first one is people who say, `I am from the Federal Government. I am here to help you.' Of course, the second greatest lie could be just about anything that you want to add to it. And I have heard various variations, which I would not care to repeat on the floor of the Senate. But the first one is, `I am from the Federal Government. I am here to help you.' 
It is true in a sense that people have a great deal of mistrust in many institutions of government. That is unfortunate. When most people think of the Internal Revenue Service, they do not think of the word `service.' They think of fear, they think of intimidation, they think of threats, and they think of all sorts of things, none of which are very good. The last thing they think of is service. 
This legislation today will go a long way to restoring service to the Internal Revenue Service and letting that agency of our government know that their principal function is to serve the people of this country. They work for the taxpayers--not the other way around. The taxpayers in Louisiana should know this is a major improvement in how that agency is going to have to operate in the future, so that no longer if you get a letter from the Internal Revenue Service should there be a fear of opening it. No longer if you get a call to come down and meet with someone from the IRS should you be intimidated about having to fulfill that request. 
Some have advocated: `Just abolish the agency.' That is a good headline. That will get you 15 seconds of fame perhaps. But is it responsible? No. Is saying, `We are going to abolish the Tax Code; and don't worry, sometime in the future we may replace it with something we hope might be better than we have now,' responsible? How do you buy a house if you do not know what the Tax Code is going to be? How do you make a business investment if you do not know what the tax laws are going to be in 12 months? While it is very simple to say, `Let's abolish everything and hopefully one day we will replace it with something that will be better than we have today,' I question whether that is the responsible thing to do. It is much easier to, as they say, kick down the barn than it is to construct a new one. 
But what we are trying to do with the Roth legislation and people who put this package together is to say we want to repair 
what is broken. We want to reform what needs reform. We want to tell the American taxpayers there will be predictability in how and when and how much tax they legally owe to run the government functions that are important to this country. 
This legislation accomplishes what I think is incredibly the most massive change in the IRS that we have ever had since the agency was created--to restore service, to restore confidence, to restore fairness to the American people when they have to deal with their government, which hopefully will treat them in a fashion that makes all of us much prouder of the work that we have done with this legislation. 
Let me just make a comment about one particular aspect of the legislation which I think is important. 
The government, it is clear, has thousands of lawyers working for the IRS on behalf of the government--when a taxpayer is called upon, and it is said that they are deficient in some kind of a way--to represent the government's interests. Now, under this legislation we will have a taxpayer advocate who will now be called the National Taxpayer Advocate. We have done more than just change the name. We have changed the functions. Taxpayers should know that they will have someone who will be on their side when they have a problem to discuss with the IRS--someone who will represent their interests, and not just represent the interests of the government against them, but represent their interests before their own government. I think that is incredibly important. 
The National Taxpayer Advocate will be appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury, but only after consulting with the Commissioner of the IRS and the new IRS oversight board. 
It is very important to further point out that the Advocate would have to have experience in customer service representing customers--not representing just the government. You will have a requirement that he also--or she--has to have experience in tax law and have experience representing individual taxpayers. You would think you would not have to spell that out. But we have to make sure that person who is going to be in that position has experience representing individual taxpayers, has a knowledge of the tax law of this country, and also has background in customer service, also getting back to the point that this is a service organization of our government. 
I think it is particularly important to ensure their independence--that we have also required in this legislation that the Taxpayer Advocate cannot have been an IRS employee within 2 years of his or her appointment, and must agree not to work for the IRS for 5 years after serving in this position. Why is that important? I think it is pretty obvious--to ensure their independence. We just do not want to pull someone out of the IRS and have them serve in this position representing taxpayers knowing that one day they will go right back to the IRS, or to have a career in the IRS and have that mindset guiding what they do representing the individual taxpayers. No. We have done just the opposite. We say that the Taxpayer Advocate has to have experience in representing the taxpayer and have experience in customer relations and not be an employee of the IRS, and not go to the IRS within 5 years after they leave this job. 
What that will ensure is that we will have a National Taxpayer Advocate who will be truly interested representing the individual taxpayer, so that taxpayer will know that there is someone on his or her side for a change when they have to present their case. 
I also point out that people believe lots of Americans are audited. That is not true. It is not true at all. Less than 2 percent of the people in the country are ever audited by the IRS. Ninety-eight percent of the people, plus--more than 98 percent--file their taxes, pay their taxes, maybe get a refund, and maybe have to owe something. But that is it. Ninety-eight percent plus of the people in this country are never audited, and abide by the law. Less than 2 percent ever have a problem with having to be audited. But when a person falls into that situation, under the new IRS service they will be assured of the fact that there will be an advocate who will stand by their side and represent their interests, and not just be an IRS employee, saying, `Don't worry, we will take care of you.' 
This is a major part of the reform that we will be voting on today. 
I would just say that this is monumental change. It is important. I think everyone who has worked and contributed to this effort, of which there have been many, would conclude with me that when we work in a bipartisan fashion we produce good results. 
And that is what we are voting on today--good legislation for all of America. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Coverdell for his work and Senator Torricelli, on our side, who has contributed so much to this debate. It gets down to basics: Are we interested in helping kids and families or helping buildings? I think the clear argument is that we should be helping students and helping families educate their children, wherever they attend school. 
One of the arguments against this bill I have heard is that, well, it gives some type of Government assistance to private or parochial schools. I want to address that issue because I think it is not a legitimate concern. I have a book here that is put out by the Department of Education, our Federal department here in Washington. It is a book of all the programs that exist currently where Federal tax dollars are used to help students regardless of where they go to school, as long as it is a legitimate school. This book is full of programs. It has about 70 pages of Federal programs that go to children. If you are poor, if you are disadvantaged, or if you have a disability, you can use that assistance to go to the school you want to go to. 
Now, the largest program we have in the Federal Government is Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It has been federal law since 1965. Let me read where Title I funds go:  
Elementary and secondary education as originally passed by Congress in 1965. Under this legislation, private school students, private school teachers, private school other personnel are included in the program. 
We do that already. We have done it since 1965. One in four schools in the country happen to be private or parochial. We are talking about helping the child get a better education, which is in the national interest. Yet, people say we are breaking a tradition of not helping private or parochial schools. We have bookloads of programs that do exactly that. This bill is consistent with that--completely and totally. 
In addition to Title I, which goes to students, like this education savings account goes to the families and students, we have other programs in the book. I will mention one or two. Child nutrition programs--do we not help private/parochial students with child nutrition programs? Of course, we do. It is important. Students with disabilities also get help. 
What about students who are not disadvantaged and do not have a disability? Are we going to ignore them? That is the largest group of people out there. I suggest this makes a great deal of sense. 
Talk about consistent. Just last year, this Congress, this body, most Democrats, and Republicans as well, voted for the $500 IRA savings account for higher education. It has the same limits on income as this proposal. The only thing we have done is make this for students in K through 12, and parents can set aside a little private money to help the child go to the school that is in their best interest to go to. We are not talking about a voucher; we are talking about a family taking their own money and putting their own money in their own savings account to help educate their child. 
It was very clear that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997--the President signed it and I congratulate him for participating and signing it--is the same program. It is just that it was for higher education. If you went to Saint Michael's College, you got a $500 savings account. Nobody thought that was an infringement on trying to give Federal aid to private/parochial schools. We all applauded that. 
Let's do the same thing for the same families, with the same income limits. Let them, for K through 12, set aside a private savings account and draw interest on it and use it for school expenses for the child. All of a sudden, this is something that is novel, something we have never done before. Of course, we have. We did it last year. We have been aiding those students since 1965 with the largest Federal education in program, Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
Students in Louisiana, when they are in a private or parochial school, get the same dollars, the same money, the same program benefits, the same child nutrition programs, and the same education for disabilities assistance. That is part of what our country is about--trying to help educate children. We are not talking about vouchers. We are not talking about doing anything other than help families help their children. 
Why do we always ignore middle-income working families? If you are poor, we have a program. If you have a disability, we have a program. If you have other problems and special education needs, you have a program. But if you are middle income and struggling to make it and raise a family and keep the family together, we say no, that is an infringement. 
It is time to encourage working middle-income Americans who are struggling, to help them to have more savings to invest in their children's education. Let's not encourage families to say, `I have no interest in it; let the government do it.' We are saying let's create an incentive for families, middle-income working families, to help their children K through 12, and not be, I think, arguing that somehow we are breaking new ground, and saying `My God, what are we going to do?' We are doing what we have done consistently since the government has been involved in trying to help many families and help counties and parishes in my State improve the educational systems in their respective. 
I commend this bill for our support.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding some of her time. As well, I thank Chairman Hatch for the work that he did on this legislation. I think the two previous speakers really need to be congratulated for bringing to the Senate a commonsense approach to what has become a very tragic situation. I would like to make just a few comments about it. 
You know, in Louisiana, where I am from, there is an old saying that if you like the end product, there are two things you should never watch being made; one is sausage, and the other is laws; because if you like the end product, you don't like the process that you go through to make either laws or sausage. If you observe it too carefully, you will never like the end product, perhaps is what they are trying to say. 
The point I am trying to make today is, what has happened on the tobacco legislation, I think, is indeed very, very tragic, because what started out with very good intentions has ended up with a very serious loss for all Americans who are concerned about trying to do something about tobacco. There was a poll by one of the television networks on Friday night. It said that 47 percent of the American people were pleased that the tobacco legislation that came up in the Senate was defeated; 46 percent said that they were disappointed it was defeated. The American people have to be horribly confused about the situation, where we are and what has transpired. 
Do you know what we are engaged in now? We are now engaged in Monday morning quarterbacking. Members of both parties are trying to figure out how we can blame each other for the defeat of something that started off so pure and so good, with the best of intentions. Now all you see is spinmeisters saying, well, it is the Republicans' fault, because they are trying to load it up with marriage penalties and vouchers and they made it a tax bill and then they decided it was too loaded up after they loaded it up. 
There are some on our side who said, `Well, no, this legislation wasn't nearly enough and wasn't tough enough on tobacco. We can be tougher on the tobacco companies than anybody else. Just watch what we can do when we want to be tough on tobacco companies.' So we started with a product that was a good product in the beginning. Then, we made it so difficult that you broke the cooperation between all of the parties that is essential to get any kind of good agreement. 
I suggest there is plenty of blame to go around on both sides. That is why 47 percent of the American people believe they are glad the tobacco bill is defeated; 46 percent do not feel happy, that the Senate should have passed it. The American people have to be horribly confused. I think now we have to take a look at where we are. What do we do? Do we continue to play the blame game for the rest of the year? Do we continue to see who can get the most political advantage? Or do we try to make one last desperate but incredibly important effort to put something together that we can pass and that will work? 
It is really interesting if you look at what happened. You have to start from where we started. The June 20 attorneys general agreement was a compromise that really got the job done. People have come to the floor of the Senate and said, `I can't be for that because this bill was written by the health groups.' Others have said, `I can't be for this bill because this bill was written by the tobacco companies.' Or they can't be for this because it was written by the attorneys general or it was written by the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
The truth, in fact, is the reason the June 20 attorneys general agreement was so good is because it was written by everyone involved. It was written by the attorneys general, who filed suit on behalf of 40 States against the tobacco companies. It was written by the tobacco companies, who were the ones being sued. It was written by the lawyers for all of the injured plaintiffs who had suffered injuries from smoking-related activities. That is why it worked, because it was not written by just one group, but it was written by everybody who had an interest in trying to get a realistic settlement passed. 
Now, all of the people who have now said that what we had on the floor was not nearly enough, I think they thought the June 20 agreement was pretty good. I was just looking at some of the old press releases about the June 20 agreement. One caught my attention the most. It was from the Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids, which has been one of the strongest advocates for more, more, more, more, more. I understand where they are coming from, and I understand their position. 
But when the June 20 agreement came out with the attorneys general and the tobacco companies, which was far less than the bill they opposed on the floor from their perspective, here is what they said about the June 20 agreement:  
The agreement with the tobacco industry announced by the state Attorneys General has the potential to save millions of lives, prevent children from starting to smoke, and help break the cycle of addiction for both children and adults. 
They continued: 
This agreement has the potential to achieve more than could be realistically gained by any other means. The agreement can be a historic turning point in the decades-old fight to protect children from tobacco addiction and bring about a fundamental change in the role of tobacco and the tobacco industry in our lives. 
They continued by saying: 
The agreement goes well beyond the provisions of the FDA Rule in terms of reducing youth access to tobacco products and curbing tobacco marketing. 
It goes on and on and on praising the June 20 agreement. The bill on the Senate floor was far better than this agreement, which they said such wonderful things about, yet because of a desire for more and more and who can be tougher, we ended up getting less and 
less and less. And where we are today is very unfortunate. 
Where we are today is, there is no settlement of any of the lawsuits. No plaintiff has ever put a nickel in their pocket as a result of suing a tobacco company. This would have provided that. No settlements because of where we are; no money for the States for their Medicaid programs; no money for the States for tobacco-related expenses; no money for the National Institutes of Health to do research in this area; no additional authority for FDA to regulate nicotine as a drug; no advertising and marketing restrictions; no targets for reducing teen smoking, with penalties if these targets are not met. There is no help for farmers for getting out of the business. 
And what we have now is a debate about whose fault it is. We are arguing about failure. We are arguing that, `It's your fault nothing was done'; `No; it's your fault nothing was done,' instead of trying to put together a compromise where we can argue about success, where we can argue about a bill that would provide all of these things that I have just outlined, and the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee outlined and about which the Senator from California spoke. We have none of that now. And we have none of that because of this rush to see who can be tougher and tougher and tougher. 
I am suggesting that what Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein have brought before the Senate is a major undertaking. And we are at the point where it is time for cooler heads to prevail. We have had the political debate. We have had the political arguments. We have had the pollsters talk about who comes out the best. And in fact, the truth is we all come out, I think, looking pretty bad. 
So I conclude by thanking Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein for doing what they are doing. The status of the tobacco legislation now, because of the Senate's action, is that it has been sent back to the Commerce Committee. I think we ought to take this legislation and bring it back to the full Senate. 
Now that we have had the political discussion, perhaps we can find a way to come together and do something where everybody can get credit. Both sides can get credit, and the American people will win. Right now we have a situation where I am afraid that everybody is a loser. This is a good, solid, balanced approach that needs to be enacted. Thank you.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we are in the middle of the debate on the so-called tobacco legislation which has been ongoing for a number of days. I think that it is appropriate to pause for a moment and to consider where we are and where we have been and to try to come up with an idea of where this debate is likely to go. Because I think that with all the debate and discussion we have had, there is some confusion as to exactly what has been happening. 
I think it is very important to recognize that in order to know where you are going, it is also important to actually know from where you started. I think if you look at where we started, Congress became involved in this tobacco legislation really as a result of attorneys general litigation on behalf of all the various States trying to recover money for the States' Medicaid programs, which had suffered a loss because of payments for people who had suffered disease and injury because of smoking-related activities. 
When it comes to this issue, I want to make one point very, very clear. I do not think any of us need to be lectured to about the problem that is facing us. All of us have examples and instances in our own lives that make the problems associated with cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry very, very clear. In my own family, my mother died of lung cancer--lung cancer that was clearly and directly related to years of tobacco use. In addition, my father-in-law died of lung cancer and tumors related clearly to smoking and exposure, probably at the same time, to asbestos. 
Probably each Member of this body and also the other body has similar stories they can relate that personally affect them in their approach to this legislation. You simply cannot divorce it. People are affected for a lifetime by personal experiences, and mine are not any different from probably many of my colleagues'. So when I approach this issue, it is with the intent of wanting to do something to reduce underage smoking in this country. 
In order to determine where we are going, it is important to look where we started. The June 20 agreement was the baseline. It was the agreement the attorneys general of this Nation, who deserve a great deal of credit, were able to reach as a result of litigation in the courts of America against the tobacco companies of America. That settlement that was immense in what it did. It was immense in the proportions of good that it did. I would like to outline it for a moment to show where we started. 
That June 20 agreement would have settled the lawsuits brought by all 40 States. It would have settled them. The States would have been compensated in their State Medicaid programs for funds that they spent to treat smokers. That is what the States wanted. It affected literally millions of people. 
In addition, it would have settled all of the individual lawsuits around this country, and people would have been compensated as a result of that settlement. In addition, it provided funds to cover the costs of implementing and enforcing several public health programs related to solving the problems of underage tobacco use and also to try to find ways to cure diseases caused by smoking. 
The tobacco companies, under that agreement, would have paid $368.5 billion, not including the attorneys' fees, over a 25-year period. Payments at the rate of $15 billion per year would have continued forever. 
It is important for us to note that for the previous 40 years there was not an individual in this country who ever put a nickel in their pocket as a result of litigation against tobacco companies. So to say that you get $368 billion-plus to cover the costs of individual suits, and to use those moneys for health programs, is monumental in what it achieved because no one had ever walked off with a nickel in their pocket as a result of that litigation. This settlement did that. 
It also did something that the FDA was never able to do. It said in the agreement that the FDA would regulate tobacco products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the FDA would have the authority to reduce nicotine levels in those products. 
It also said we are going to set some goals, and the goals are going to be that you would have to show a 30-percent decline in cigarette and smokeless tobacco use by minors within 5 years --a 30-percent reduction--a 50-percent reduction within 7 years; and a 60-percent reduction within 10 years. If not successful, penalties would be assessed against the companies of up to $2 billion a year. 
That had never been done before in the history of this country, where you set absolute targets that companies agreed to and suffered penalties if they did not meet those targets, which were substantial. 
It also said, on advertising and marketing, that tobacco advertising would be banned on billboards, in store promotions, and displays over the Internet. No more Marlboro Man, no more cartoon characters like Joe Camel. Tobacco would also be banned from sponsoring all sporting events. No more race car events, no more race track events, no more anything from a sporting standpoint at which they would be able to sell or advertise. No more clothing, no more baseball caps, no more jackets, none of that would have been allowed under this agreement. Tobacco companies agreed to that. Companies agreed to the targets; companies agreed to the FDA regulation; companies agreed to pay $368.5 billion. 
Also, the warning labels were stronger than ever. Like, `Smoking can kill you.' Can you get it any stronger than that? You read that and still want to do it? Is there something loose somewhere in your head? That was going to be part of it. 
It includes substantial restrictions on youth access to cigarettes; a ban on cigarettes being sold from vending machines unless they are adult-only facilities; minimum standards for retailers. All of that was in there. 
If you had said this was possible to have 5 years ago, they would have looked at you and said, `No way. You can't get that done.' But that is all part of the agreement. That is where we started. 
I would just like to talk about some things that I think are part of this agreement that are not going to be able to be accomplished if we do not have an agreement that includes the companies. 
Marketing and advertising restrictions under this agreement took everything that the FDA wanted to have done and said, it is part of the agreement. It bans nontobacco brand names or logos on tobacco products. It bans tobacco brand names, logos and selling messages on nontobacco merchandise, i.e., the T-shirts, baseball caps, jackets; no more of that. 
It bans the sponsorship, as I said, of all sporting and cultural events in the name, logo or selling message of a tobacco product brand. It restricts tobacco advertising to black text on white background only, like this chart. It requires tobacco advertising to have a statement, `Nicotine delivery device.' It bans offers of nontobacco items or gifts based on the proof of purchasing a cigarette product. All gone. That is all what the FDA would like to have done, which, incidentally, is being litigated. Companies accepted that as part of that settlement agreement. 
It also said, we are going to do a lot more than that beyond what FDA wanted to do on marketing and advertising. This agreement spelled out some other things. We talked about it; that is, banning all outdoor tobacco product advertising, as in stadiums; and for indoor facilities directed outdoors. It bans the human images, again, like the cartoon characters of Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. No more advertising on the Internet. It limits point-of-sale advertising to black-on-white. All of these things that no one has ever been able to accomplish was agreed to by the lawyers, agreed to by the defendants, agreed to by the tobacco companies as part of the settlement agreement. 
In addition to that, we also have youth-access restrictions. Retailers are prohibited from selling cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to children under 18, and all of the things they have to do under a youth-access restriction program. 
The point that I make is that all of this is part of their agreement. I am concerned that what we have done is to take this agreement, which no one would have thought possible 5 years ago, 4 years ago, and have turned it into an attempt to make a Christmas tree, to take care of all kinds of additional items, increase the amount everywhere you possibly can. I understand that. 
It is a race to see who can be the toughest on tobacco companies, and I understand that, too. My concern is, in our race to be the toughest, that we will lose all of the things that I have just outlined. Because I am absolutely convinced, from testimony in the Commerce Committee, that those restrictions on marketing and advertising that are in the current legislation, without the companies agreeing to it, is not going to be constitutionally upheld by the courts of this country--will not be. We cannot restrict advertising to adults. We cannot restrict advertising of legal products to adults that only incidentally affect children. 
The court cases are very, very clear with regard to what we can do and cannot do. The first amendment applies, yes, even to tobacco products, as long as they are legal, 
and no one is yet saying we will outlaw tobacco products like we tried to outlaw alcohol. 
I am concerned that as we increase everything that we are increasing, we lose the company's participation in this effort, and we are going to end up with something that may make us feel good temporarily but will not get the job done. An analogy is of the little boy who puts his hand in the cookie jar and tries to take all the cookies out of the jar; he has so many in his hand, he can't get anything out. 
We went from the base of $368.5 billion from the settlement; we increased that with a tax of $1.10, so now it is $574.5 billion. Then after we added to the base payments, we also added the look-back provisions. The look-back was the penalty for companies that didn't meet the targets I talked about. The June 20 agreement had penalties. The Commerce bill raised the penalty potential to $706 billion. Floor amendments raised it to $810 billion on the look-back. 
I think that is questionable constitutionally. I think it is questionable whether you can say to a company, you have to do all kind of things, but if you do all those things and still don't meet the targets we will penalize you. I think it is questionable constitutionally for the ability to do that unless the companies agree to it. I think what we are doing is penalizing companies without any fault on their part. We are saying, do all of these things, but if you don't reach these targets we are going to hit you with $810 billion worth of penalties. They can agree to that; but if they don't agree to it, I doubt whether it will pass constitutional muster. 
I think the marketing and advertising restrictions happen to be the most important thing we can do in order to get teens to stop smoking. The $1.10 is not going to do it. Kids pay $100 for a pair of sneakers. Do you think $1.10 will get that many to quit smoking when they are paying $100 for a pair of tennis shoes? I doubt it. Marketing and advertising restrictions are very important--probably not constitutional. 
The look-back provisions: Sounds good. Let's make it as high as we can. If the companies don't agree, I question whether that is constitutional. 
Look what we did when you add it up. The base payments were increased, the look-back provisions, and now the judgments. We used to have a $5 billion annual cap for liability payments. This is for future suits. People say we are giving them all kinds of limitations on liability. Individuals can still sue in the future, can still have criminal actions against companies in the future, under the agreement. You can still have punitive damages in the future for companies who do wrong, and intentionally do it, but what we have done--we have gone from adding an increase in base payments, increased the look-back penalties, and took the cap off any annual limitations on future payments. We have gone from $435 billion to $906.4 billion, and now we add it up and there is no limit. Why would a company agree to all of those marketing and advertising restrictions, agree to all these look-back penalties and targets that they have to meet, and get nothing in return? 
I am not arguing their case. I made it very clear where I come from in the beginning. An agreement, unless it is comprehensive, an agreement, unless everybody is involved in it, is an agreement on paper that may make us feel good temporarily but is not an agreement that is going to get the job done. 
It is incredibly important that we look at reality and come up with something that works. I suggest that we take the June 20 agreement as the basis, pass it, go to conference in the House, and we can work out something that will work. Senator Hatch, I understand, and Senator Feinstein and others on our side are working together to take what people thought was impossible and pass it. 
Let's get out of the cookie jar. Let's get back to reality. Let's do something that will pass, that will work, and that will make good sense. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, since colonial times, waterborne commerce has been key to the economic growth and vitality of our Nation. It has been especially important for my home state of Louisiana. The entire U.S. economy, and that of Louisiana, depends on an efficient and reliable transportation system to remain competitive in domestic and international markets. Navigable channels, railways, highways, and ports are links in the transportation chain that allow manufacturers, buyers, and sellers to send and receive goods quickly, safely, and efficiently. Congress has recognized the importance and need for promoting a system of seamless intermodal connections, from ship to shore, and then to rail or truck, and ultimately to the consumer's local retail store. The original ISTEA legislation, was named for intermodalism, in recognition of the importance of fostering and promoting intermodalism, and I am confident that ISTEA II will continue our efforts to expand and modernize the infrastructure needed to facilitate intermodalism. 
Continued adequate investment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure, including federal navigation channels, is critical. In fact, in Louisiana we have literally hundreds of miles of navigable waterways crisscrossing our state. The resulting benefits of this waterway system are efficient access to a wide variety of products and services, internationally competitive exports, and lower costs for consumers. Maintaining deep draft navigation channels is one of the most important, and least understood, factors in maintaining an efficient national transportation system. The need for both maintenance and deepening of navigational channels will drastically increase as vessel operators continue to switch to newer and larger vessels. 
The most modern and largest container ships available today are capable of carrying over 6,000 TEUs. By way of comparison, this cargo load would translate into a train length of over 27 miles. However, these vessels require navigable channels in excess of 45 feet of depth in order to get into port in a fully laden mode. We can have the greatest system of intermodal infrastructure available, but if the gigantic vessels that will be plying the seven seas cannot enter our ports, our importers and exporters will not benefit, and we will lose the competitive advantages of having cheap and safe transportation. 
U.S. port development and maintenance is currently a shared responsibility of federal, state, and local governments, with extensive private sector participation. Under this relationship, rooted in the U.S. Constitution, the Federal government has maintained harbor access channels and contributed a share towards channel improvements, while individual ports construct and maintain the land-side terminal facilities, including developing rail and highway access, dredging their own shipping berths, and contributing to channel improvement cost-sharing programs. 
Since 1789, the Federal Government has authorized navigation channel improvement projects, and the General Survey Act of 1824 established the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as the agency responsible for the Nation's navigation system. Relying in good faith on this long-standing partnership, local port authorities spend approximately $1.3 billion annually to construct and maintain the land-side facilities. These local investments have been paid for through state taxes and bonds and have resulted in a port system that can be relied on to meet our country's national defense needs and accommodate our ever growing international trade. 
Traditionally, the Federal Government funded maintenance dredging of federal navigation channels from General Treasury revenues. However in 1986, Congress enacted the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to pay for a portion of channel maintenance dredging. Revenue for this trust fund is generated by assessing a fee, the `Harbor Maintenance Tax' or HMT, on the value of export, import, and domestic cargo moving through the nation's deep draft ports. At the same time, local cost-sharing was instituted for funding new construction projects. These projects allow a Port to either widen or deepen navigable channels. By way of contrast, on the inland waterways, operations and maintenance costs are paid out of the General Treasury, and new construction costs are funded, in part, by an inland waterways fuel tax.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia not only for his comments, but also for his untiring work on this very important legislation. He is to be commended. I thank all of our colleagues for their work and their contribution on the highway bill. But I assure everyone in this country that were it not for the senior Senator from West Virginia, this bill would not have been passed in this body this afternoon and be part of one of the most massive improvements of our transportation system in this country. He is to be commended. I know there are so many people that are not here today that want to say thank you to the very distinguished Senator for his contribution in this regard.

Mr. BREAUX. Let me make a brief comment. I want to associate my comments and feeling with the earlier remarks of the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, with regard to his comments about this bill and the use of funds in the highway legislation that could be used for veterans disability benefits associated with smoking. 
I was very, very pleased to hear Senator Daschle point out very clearly that this issue will be revisited. It needs to be revisited. It is unfortunate, I think, that moneys that were going to be available for veterans who have suffered disabilities from smoking problems will be used for part of this legislation that we just recently passed. But I think it is very clear there is a strong feeling among most all members of the Commerce Committee that this is an issue that needs to be revisited. We need to find the funds to make sure that these types of health disabilities are taken care of and that if it is a veterans disability associated with their service that they be treated as such. I support that. I will be here to do anything that I can to try and correct this problem. 
As we deal with the tobacco legislation on the floor, it would seem to me this would be, perhaps, a good way of addressing this particular issue as a health-related smoking issue. I hope we could find a way within the tobacco legislation to address this. 
I stand committed to work with Senator Daschle on finding a way to correct this problem. I am quite confident that we will be able to do so, and certainly I am committed to do that. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, a very important bill for America's children. Our bill, the Vaccinate America's Children Now Act, will cut the excise tax on all vaccines to twenty-five cents per dose. Lowering the price of vaccines against such deadly and crippling diseases as polio and meningitis will not only result in lower health care costs, but also greater immunization rates. As a result, fewer American children will ever have to know the pain and devastation of childhood disease. 
Federal excise taxes on vaccines were first enacted in the late 1980s to fund a vaccine injury compensation fund to pay for those rare injuries associated with vaccination. Since enactment, this compensation fund has accumulated a surplus of $1.2 billion and the surplus continues to grow. However, claims against the fund have been falling as a result of safer vaccines. The interest alone on this fund is now enough to pay the anticipated claims and costs each year. Lowering the excise tax rate on vaccines will not endanger the solvency of the vaccine injury compensation trust fund in any way. In fact, the guardian of the trust fund, the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines has unanimously endorsed our proposal. 
Lowering the vaccine tax rates will, however, reduce health care costs and make immunization more affordable. Our bill will save states money because states pay these excise taxes when vaccines are purchased for state immunization programs. For example, our bill will save my own State of Louisiana approximately $1 million. Nationwide, reducing the excise tax will save the states almost $53 million. These cost savings are one reason why the Association of States and Territorial Health Officers which represents all of the state health departments also supports our bill. 
Vaccines are a modern miracle--preventing disease and illness often for a lifetime with just a few doses. Vaccines have virtually eliminated the scourge of smallpox in the world. Polio as a wild virus has been eliminated in the western hemisphere. Measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis vaccines have saved thousands of lives. We must do every thing that we can to ensure that children continue to be immunized. Our bill will make these vaccines more affordable and more available to all of America's children.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to rise to introduce a piece of legislation, which I will send to the desk. It is called the Space Launch Cost Reduction Act of 1998. 
The commercial space launch industry is an essential part of the U.S. economy and opportunities for U.S. companies are growing as international markets expand. United States trading partners have been able to aggressively lower their commercial space launch prices either through direct cash payments for commercially targeted product development or with indirect benefits derived from nonmarket economy status. Because United States incentives for launch vehicle development have historically focused on civil and military rather than commercial use, and as a result U.S. launch costs have remained relatively high, the U.S. share of the world commercial market has decreased from nearly 100% twenty years ago to approximately 40% in 1998. This is very serious erosion. 
The key to regaining United States leadership in the world market is not another massive government program, but rather provision of just enough government support to enable the more cost effective private sector to build lower-cost space launch vehicles. Private sector companies across the United States are already attempting to develop a variety of lower-cost space launch vehicles, but lack of sufficient private financing has proven a major obstacle, an obstacle our trading partners have chosen to remove by providing direct access to government funding. Given the unique strength of private industry in the United States, a more effective alternative to the approach of our trading partners is for the U.S. government to provide limited financial incentives in the form of loan guarantees, which would help qualifying private-sector companies secure otherwise unattainable private financing, while at the same time keeping government involvement at an absolute minimum. 
The purpose of the Space Launch Cost Reduction Act of 1998 is, therefore, to ensure availability of otherwise unattainable private sector financing for private sector development of commercial space launch vehicles with launch costs significantly below current levels. As a result, it will be possible to: increase the international competitiveness of the United States space industry, encourage the growth of space-related commerce in the United States and internationally, increase the number of high-value jobs in United States space-related industries, and reduce United States Government space launch expenditures. 
Commercialization of space is an issue of importance not only to our nation as a whole but also to the state of Louisiana. Louisiana is already an active participant in the American space effort. For example, the Michoud Facility in New Orleans has been selected as the fabrication center for the experimental X-33 space vehicle's liquid oxygen tanks. The fuel tanks for the Space Shuttle are also built at Michoud, and Shuttle engines are tested at the Stennis Space Center in neighboring Mississippi. Furthermore, NASA has entered a partnership with the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette to establish a Regional Application Center for commercial remote sensing technology. Looking toward the future, Louisiana is clearly well positioned to participate actively in the commercialization of space and to benefit from the Space Launch Cost Reduction Act of 1998.

Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair. 
I rise in support of the legislation and say to all of my colleagues, and to the American public as well, it is very good news that we are now at the point of not talking about it as much as we are actually trying to do something to fix the 
problem. The problem I speak of is the information that Congress and the Senate have received over the past several weeks regarding what I will argue are fundamental abuses within the Internal Revenue Service and how they treat many American citizens. 
The hearings the Finance Committee held really brought out some very disturbing facts and information about the interaction of the Internal Revenue Service with average Americans. We have a tax system in this country with which most people completely and totally comply. We have one of the highest rates of compliance of any free nation anywhere in the world. It is something of which we can be very proud. 
Also, it is interesting to note--and maybe people don't realize--that less than 2 percent of American taxpayers are audited each year, substantially less than 2 percent as a matter of fact, which means most Americans file their tax returns, pay what they owe during the year, and at the end of the year that is it in terms of their dealings with the Internal Revenue Service. But still, in all, it seems there is a very disturbing feeling by most Americans that the Internal Revenue Service, an agency of our own Government, is not only on their side but actually is against their basic interests in how they deal with their own Government. I know that for a fact. I even feel somewhat intimidated by calling the agency myself on behalf of a constituent. The response seems to come back: How dare you call us. We are the IRS and you have no business making an inquiry. 
The other story that goes around is people have pointed out one of the greatest lies ever told is: I'm from the Government and I'm here to help you. 
It is like someone who gets a letter from the Internal Revenue Service; generally it evokes a tremendous amount of fear from the average citizens in this country when they get such a letter. It is always the butt of so many evening television shows, jokes about people actually having a fear of their own Government and an actual fear of the agents of our own Government, who are Federal employees, who actually work for the citizens of this country. 
I think the hearings show this is a feeling among far too many people in this country. What we are doing is bringing legislation to the floor to try to correct some of those abuses and make it work more on behalf of American citizens instead of against American citizens. 
A couple of weeks ago, I was back in Louisiana and someone from my State said, `What do you have coming up this week?' I said, `We are going to have more hearings on the Internal Revenue Service.' And my constituent said in response, `My God, you have had enough hearings. When are you going to do something about fixing the problem? We know there is a problem; when are you going to fix it? Are you going to spend the whole year talking about it? We got the message; there is a problem. The question is, What is Congress going to do to attempt to fix the problem?' 
I am pleased to report that is why we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate today with legislation that has been reported out in a bipartisan fashion. Under the leadership of the distinguished chairman, Senator Roth, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Moynihan, we have brought this piece of legislation to the floor. I want to particularly commend Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, who has been on the floor this morning and yesterday outlining this legislation. He chaired a commission which really did a great deal of work prior to the Congress bringing up this legislative proposal. His work as commission chairman really was the genesis for bringing about this real effort to reform the Internal Revenue Service. 
Some would say, `Just throw it out, scratch it, do away with it.' That is all fine and good. I can give a great speech anywhere in the country talking about abolishing the IRS. But also, it is important to find out, what are you replacing it with? What type of agency do you have to collect the revenues to run the Government? 
I think people legitimately are concerned. They want the services of Government. They want the highway trust fund to work. They want the highway program to work. They want Medicare and they want the Medicaid programs to work. They want education to work. They want the services of Government, but in order to have that, you have to have some mechanism to collect taxes in a fair manner. We should do everything we can to make the system more fair and make it more simple than it is, but eventually we are going to have to have some agency that is going to participate in helping collect those taxes under a fair system. 
I think what we do today is to try to improve that system. We say we are going to make it work better, we are going to attempt to eliminate the abuses in the system and abuses by people who work for the Internal Revenue Service. 
I would like to concentrate just on one feature of the bill that is now before the Senate, and that is something that I have worked on hard--in fact, introduced a separate bill on, to create a National Taxpayer Advocate to help taxpayers when they 
have problems with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Back in 1996, in the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, we established this Taxpayer Advocate. The concept was not very complicated. It was, when people have a problem with the Internal Revenue Service, they generally are at the mercy of the system. The Government has literally thousands of attorneys and tax attorneys and prosecutors to go after individuals, but the individual citizens don't have anyone to represent their interests in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. The National Taxpayer Advocate concept was to have someone who was on the side of the taxpayers, to help the taxpayers put together what they need to show what they have done was entirely honest and appropriate. 
The National Taxpayer Advocate did establish this position of a Taxpayer Advocate Office, and the function was to assist the taxpayers in resolving their problems and to identify areas in which taxpayers have problems in dealings with IRS, and also propose any administrative changes that would help make the system more fair, and identify any legislative recommendations that we in Congress could institute to make it more fair and easier for the average taxpayer. 
The problem with the old law in 1996 was that the Taxpayer Advocate designated authority, under these assistance programs, to the local and regional resolution officers who worked for the Internal Revenue Service. This really undermined the independence of the Taxpayer Advocate. It is very important, if you are going to have people who help the taxpayer, that they should not be totally dictated to by the Internal Revenue Service itself. It was something that, while it had the right intention, did not work as it should. 
This legislation contains several very important changes. I am very pleased to report to our other colleagues that this legislation corrects some of the problems with the original Taxpayer Advocate Office. We are going to make it more independent, which it has to be in order to work. We are going to make it more accountable to the taxpayers of this country, who are the people they are there to serve, and make it easier for them to resolve disputes between the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service. 
The bill, in doing that, replaces the present law's problem resolution system with a system of local taxpayer advocates who report directly to the National Taxpayer Advocate Office and who will be employees of the Taxpayer Advocate Office, independent from the Internal Revenue Service's examination, collection, and appeals function. In other words, they will be working directly for the Taxpayer Advocate Office and will be independent of the IRS examination and collection offices and appeals office. 
The National Taxpayer Advocate has a responsibility to evaluate and take personnel actions with respect to any local taxpayer advocate or any employee in the Office of the National Taxpayer Advocate. And to further ensure their independence, the National Taxpayer Advocate may not have been an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service during the 2-year period ending with their appointment and will not be able to accept employment with the IRS for at least 5 years after ceasing to be the National Taxpayer Advocate. That means the people who are going to be running this office cannot just have come out of the Internal Revenue Service, where their loyalties would be legitimately questioned. And they have to agree they will not go to work for the Internal Revenue Service for at 
least 5 years after they leave this position. 
So what we are creating, I think, is a truly independent National Taxpayer Advocate Office, to be on the side of the taxpayer for a change instead of being on the side of the Government, saying they are going to represent the interests of the taxpayer. There is a conflict there. If you are going to have adequate representation for the individual taxpayer, the person cannot be an IRS employee; they have a different obligation of what they are trying to do. 
So this Taxpayer Advocate Office will not be able to be a previous IRS employee and not be able to go to work right after giving up the job as a National Taxpayer Advocate. I think that feature is very, very important, because if you were still an employee of the IRS directly under their responsibility, it simply would not work. If you just came out of the IRS, it would not work. And if you knew you were going to go to work for the IRS as soon as you finished the job as a National Taxpayer Advocate, then you would be looking over your shoulder to make sure you didn't make them mad or unhappy in what you did in representing America's taxpayers. 
That conflict has been eliminated by what we have in the legislation which is now before the Senate. The whole concept is to have a truly independent National Taxpayer Advocate whose one focus will be making sure that taxpayers have good representation, are fairly treated, and have someone, for a change, who is really on their side when they have a conflict with the Internal Revenue Service. 
It is interesting to note that we go further in this legislation and say that at the initial meeting with any taxpayers seeking assistance with the Office of Taxpayer Advocate, that the local taxpayer advocate is required to notify that taxpayer that they operate independently of the IRS office and that they report directly to Congress through the National Taxpayer Advocate. At the discretion of the local taxpayer advocate, he shall not disclose to any IRS employee any contact with or any information that they provide to the taxpayer. 
We are really trying to build some walls between the IRS and the Taxpayer Advocate and their work with the taxpayers, the American citizens of this country, to make sure that they, the taxpayers, know the person they are dealing with is independent, has their interests at heart, and doesn't have to go report to the Internal Revenue Service district director about what he or she has discussed or talked about with the taxpayer who is seeking assistance. 
In addition, each local office of the Taxpayer Advocate is to maintain separate phones, separate faxes, and other electronic communications access, and a separate post office address. We are really trying to make it as separate and independent as we possibly can, so that when the average person gets that letter talking about an audit or a question that they have, they know there will be someplace they can go without having to incur the expense of hiring outside CPAs or outside attorneys and pay them sometimes very high fees just to have someone help them with their problem. There will be someplace they can go, which will be independent of the IRS, which will have as their first, second, third, and last mission to help that taxpayer. They can be comfortable there will not be communication or sharing of information of their discussions with the Taxpayer Advocate with the Internal Revenue Service. 
I think this is a very important part of the bill that is before the Senate today. Other features in the bill are equally as important, certainly, and I think in the end will go a very long way to assuring the American taxpayers that they have a system that is not out to get them, that is not out to intimidate them, that is not out to embarrass them; that if they are honest taxpayers, they will be treated honestly and will be treated fairly and, if they have a problem, there will be someplace they can go to get honest information and help and assistance that is not directed by the Internal Revenue Service but is being directed by the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate. That is now part of this bill, and I think it is a very important part of it as well. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, as I see other Members who are waiting to speak.  
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is always interesting in the morning to start your day by reading the newspapers. I did that as well this morning. I think that most of the things that we read are pretty accurate and pretty correct. But every now and then I think what we read, while it may be accurate and correct, doesn't tell the entire story. I think this morning, if you look at the papers around the city, most of the headlines that I saw were accurate in the sense that they talked about Social Security and the condition of Social Security. The stories in the press this morning dealt with that. That was all based on the recent Social Security report. 
It talked about the good news dealing with Social Security. I look at the headlines in the Washington Post, `Forecast Brightens for Social Security.' The Wall Street Journal headline was `Economy gives Social Security a Reprieve.' A New York Times article, `Surging Economy is Lifting Social Security, U.S. finds.' The headline in the USA Today was `Social Security Wins Three-Year Reprieve.' 
All of that is very accurate. All of it is very, very true. All of it is based on the Social Security trustees' annual report that they give to Congress and to the American people and to the President of the United States. 
If you just read those headlines, you will say, `Well, things are really good in the area of Social Security.' The good news, I think, was based on the fact that the trustees' report pointed out that the payroll tax that we pay every month will be able to cover Social Security benefits through the year 2013 as opposed to the early projections that the payroll tax is only going to be enough to pay for benefits through the year 2012. They say that when you combine the payroll tax and the interest paid on the reserves that are in the Social Security trust fund, that would be enough money to cover the benefits to retirees through the year 2021 instead of just through the year 2019. 
They further point out that it is good news that the Social Security trust fund, when you add everything up, will not be depleted until the year 2032 instead of the year 2029. All of that is good news. The President correctly spoke about the fact that we added 3 more years to the Social Security program because of the strength of the economy basically. But the reason I take the floor today is to point out `the rest of the story,' as the words go, in other areas, because there is another part of the story that didn't seem to get the attention that I think it should have gotten from the press, because the stories don't highlight the other trust fund that I think is equally important and was also released yesterday by the trustees' report. The other trust fund that I am referring to is the Medicare trust fund, 
the Medicare part A trust fund, which basically pays the expense of 38 million Americans going to the hospital to receive health care. 
But the story that is only sort of mentioned as a footnote is that not only have we not run a surplus in the Medicare trust fund since 1995, including deficit spending of $9.3 billion last year, they did not point out that the part A trust fund is going broke 2 years earlier than we had anticipated just this past January. 
What the report says is that instead of going broke in the year 2010, it is going to be depleted in the year 2008. And the numbers I just cited for Social Security, talking about 2032 and 2013, those are dates that are at least a little bit further out. But the report said that we are going to be going broke in the Medicare trust fund 2 years earlier than they had in January. I think that is incredibly significant. 
Prior to the balanced budget bill that we passed last year, the hospital insurance fund, which pays for Medicare hospital coverage, was estimated to become insolvent in the year 2001, just around the corner. So last Congress we struggled and did what I call the `SOS' approach, `same old, same old,' by essentially reducing reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. And particularly in addition to that, what we did to sort of save the program in Medicare was to transfer home health care from part A to part B, at least we transferred part of it. We transferred about 60 percent of it, which amounts to about $174 billion over the next 10 years. We just took it out of this column, which was having a lot of trouble being paid for by the payroll tax and moved it over to part B, which is 25 percent paid for by a premium, and then the 75 percent is paid for by the General Treasury of the country out of general revenues. 
So what we did, we put a Band-Aid on Medicare. We tried to save it from going busted in the year 2001 and we extended it out to the year 2008. 
It is interesting that the Congressional Budget Office earlier this year had said, well, we thought the trust fund was going to be solvent until the year 2010. But now we have this new report just out yesterday, brand new, overlooked generally by the press, in my opinion, that said the Medicare trust fund was going to be insolvent not in the year 2010, but that the trust fund will be depleted in the year 2008. So unlike Social Security, where people are saying it is getting better than we first thought, Medicare is getting worse, and it is getting worse more quickly than was originally anticipated even in January of this year. 
We look at the year 2021 as the key year in Social Security because that is the year when you add taxes and the interest in the trust fund. It will no longer be enough to cover Social Security benefits. That is the year we all talk about Social Security, that we are not going to have enough money to pay benefits--when you add money coming in plus the interest on that money, we are not going to have enough to pay the benefits in the year 2002. 
I want to tell my colleagues that we passed that point in Medicare a long time ago. Medicare is already passed the point where the money coming in and the interest on the money coming in is not enough to pay for the benefits. We passed that in 1995 when the accumulated taxes and interest in Medicare were no longer enough to pay the benefits of Medicare. So we are not talking the year 2021 as in Social Security. We are talking 
about we already passed that point when it comes to Medicare. That is how much more difficulty the Medicare system is in than the Social Security system. We have been running a deficit in the program since 1995. Last year, it was $8.3 billion more in benefits than we had in money coming in and the interest in the trust fund. It is obvious we cannot continue that. 
I would like to quote a couple of the other highlights from the report which I think are significant. The trustees' report says that to bring the health insurance Medicare part A trust fund into balance over the next 25 years under their intermediate assumptions would require either that outlays be further reduced by 18 percent, or that taxes be increased by 22 percent or some combination of the two over that period. That is, they say, `the current HI payroll tax of 1.54 percent would have to be immediately raised to about 1.81 percent or the benefits reduced by a comparable amount.' 
I haven't heard anyone in my State of Louisiana that I have the privilege of representing telling me to raise their payroll tax by 22 percent, and I have not heard a single person come in and say, `Senator, would you please cut my benefits by 18 percent.' More of what I hear is, `Don't increase my taxes and don't decrease my benefits.' 
But I will say to all of our colleagues that that is not an option. That is not an option. The report further says that prior to the Balanced Budget Act of last year, the part A expenditures were estimated to grow at an average rate of about 8 percent a year in Medicare. From 1998 to the year 2002, what we did last year in the balanced budget amendment reduces annual growth to an estimated average of 3 percent. Thereafter, however, expenditure growth is expected to return to the level of about 7-percent increases every year in Medicare costs. 
The report further says that `the balanced budget provisions are estimated to substantially reduce the gap between income and expenditures over the next 5 years, but with a return to steadily increasing deficits in the year 2003 and later. After 2002, the gap between income and expenditures will widen steadily so that by the year 2007 there would be a $26 billion shortfall in that year alone.' 
Those are very sobering statistics. Unfortunately, I think they are very accurate. I have long been very concerned that we in the Congress and the public have this sort of false sense of security that because every year I get my Medicare benefits and I still get the coverage I need, there really is not a problem; that the people who are talking about a problem are sort of like Chicken Little who ran around the country saying, `The sky is falling. The sky is falling.' It never fell, and they didn't believe Chicken Little any longer. I think people don't believe Congress anymore. If you look at the headlines I talked about, I think they miss the point about Medicare which is much more immediate. It is around the corner, good news and bad news. Good news that Social Security is in pretty decent shape. We made 3 more years extra out of the program. But the bad news and the very legitimate concern we should have is that Medicare is predicted to go insolvent even earlier than before, 2 years earlier than we had previously predicted. 
So I hope that more people will take a look at the trustees' report. It is a good report. It is a sobering report and one that every American, whether they are on Medicare or whether their parents are on Medicare or their grandparents are on Medicare, should take a look at and know that there must be a growing awareness among all people in our country that if we are going to continue to have the greatest system of health care for America's seniors, we have to start making decisions now and recommendations now if we are going to prevent what this report says is going to happen in the not too distant future. 
The trustees' report noted--I will conclude with this:  
More far-reaching measures will be needed to prevent the trust fund's depletion as the baby boom generation starts reaching age 65 and starts receiving their benefits. . . . In this regard, the work of the Bipartisan Commission will be of critical importance to the Administration, the Congress and the American public. 
I could not agree more. I commend this very sobering report to all Americans, because it, indeed, is a wake-up call as to what this Congress needs to be seriously considering in the very short period of time we have left. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BREAUX. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation allowing certain U.S. legal tender coins to be qualified investments for an individual retirement account (IRA). 
Congress excluded `collectibles', such as antiques, gold and silver bullion, and legal tender coinage, as appropriate for contribution to IRAs in 1981. The primary reason was the concern that individuals would get a tax break when they bought collectibles for their personal use. For example, a taxpayer might deduct the purchase of an antique rug for his/her living room as an IRA investment. Congress was also concerned about how the many different types of collectibles are valued. 
Over the years, however, certain coins and precious metals have been excluded from the definition of a collectible because they are independently valued investments that offer investors portfolio diversity and liquidity. For example, Congress excluded gold and silver U.S. American Eagles from the definition of collectibles in 1986, and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 took the further step of excluding certain precious metals bullion. 
My legislation would exclude from the definition of collectibles only those U.S. legal tender coins which meet the following three standards: certification by a nationally-recognized grading service, traded on a nationally-recognized network, and held by a qualified trustee as described in the Internal Revenue Code. In other words, only investment quality coins that are independently valued and not held for personal use may be included in IRAs. 
There are several nationally-recognized, independent certification or grading services. Full-time professional graders (numismatists) examine each coin for authenticity and grade them according to established standards. Upon certification, the coin is sonically-sealed (preserved) to ensure that it remains in the same condition as when it was graded. 
Legal tender coins are then traded via two independent electronic networks--the Certified Coin Exchange and Certified CoinNet. These networks are independent of each other and have no financial interest in the legal tender coinage and precious metals markets. The networks function in precisely the same manner as the NASDAQ with a series of published `bid' and `ask' prices and last trades. The buys and sells are enforceable prices that must be honored as posted until updated. 
Mr. President, the liquidity provided through a bona fide national trading network, combined with published prices, make legal tender coinage a practical investment that offers investors diversification and liquidity. Investment in these tangible assets has become a safe and prudent course of action for both the small and large investor and should be given the same treatment under the law as other financial investments. I urge the Senate to enact this important legislation as soon as possible.

Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I would imagine that all Members of the Senate who are vitally interested in this legislation must be here this morning to follow these very complicated, very detailed arguments. This, indeed, is incredibly complicated. It just always continues to amaze me how complicated some of these international shipping agreements can become. It is part of the reason why it took 4 years to put together this legislation. This is not something that just came to the floor overnight but is the result of 4 years of painful negotiating and compromise among people who ship packages and cargo, people who carry packages and cargo internationally. 
Mr. President, 96 percent of our cargoes carried internationally are on shipping vessels. It also has involved, to a large extent, the people who put together packages for people to ship in order to make it more efficient than it has been in the past. 
Like all other compromises that normally are reached, everybody doesn't get everything they want. I think this 
legislation is an example of what a true compromise is. This legislation clearly is incredibly important because it further deregulates the shipping industry and makes it more competitive than it has been in the past. 
But in reaching that compromise among all of the Senators who are involved, including Senator Gorton and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who has done such a terrific job as the chairman of our subcommittee, Senator Lott's involvement, Senator Inouye's involvement--everybody on the committee has been deeply involved on this very complicated issue, like I said, for 4 years. 
Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from Washington is a killer amendment in the sense that if this amendment were to be adopted, the 4 years of hard work would go for naught. This bill would not be able to pass because the carefully crafted compromise would fall apart. As in most compromises, if you lose one part, you will lose the whole deal. 
So it is very, very important for all of us who want to see a shipping act adopted and signed into law to recognize that it is necessary this morning to defeat the amendment of the Senator from Washington. I know it is well intended. I do not in any way question his motives in offering it, but I think that on the facts, there is a strong difference of opinion. 
The non-vessel-operating common carriers, the so-called NVOCCs, are not actually in the business of carrying cargo at all. These organizations were formed in 1984 and recognized in 1984 in order to help very small shippers who would not ordinarily have enough cargo to fill an entire container, who would hire these NVOCCs to consolidate the cargo and put them in the container. But it is very, very clear that they are not a carrier, they don't own ships, they don't have the expense of having an entire shipping company at their disposal in building ships and operating ships and everything else. 
Yet under the Gorton amendment, they would want to be treated just like a shipper would be treated and yet not have any of the expenses of a common carrier. That is wrong. That is why it was not done. It is wrong to say they are going to get special treatment and be treated just like an international shipping company with all of their expenses because in fact they are not so. Yet the Gorton amendment would basically accord these intermediary companies, who actually do not perform any transportation function itself, the same contractual rights that an ocean carrier enjoys, without any of the expense, without any of the liability, without any of the responsibility. That is simply not right, and it is not correct. 
I submit that this is a hindrance to small business because the small NVOCCs could not do this. They do not have enough cargo to be able to provide these types of special deals. So the small NVOCCs would not be helped at all. What it would help basically is a large number of foreign NVOCCs, particularly from the European theater, who would be able to assimilate large enough amounts of cargo in order to participate under the Gorton amendment. 
This would not help small intermediaries at all. They simply do not have the capacity to benefit from it. Small NVOCCs, by virtue of the modest cargoes that they handle, as I have said, would not be able to take advantage of the Gorton amendment. Only the big, huge megacompanies out of Europe and foreign companies who are our competition would be able to participate. America's small businesses, I think, do not deserve this type of treatment. 
So I just conclude by saying, No. 1, it not fair to the small companies in America. It helps the larger ones basically in Europe; and that is not our responsibility. In addition to that, it is a killer amendment. The 4 years of hard work led by so many on this committee--including Senator Gorton, who has been, I think, very helpful in putting this package together; we differ on this one amendment--but the whole thing would go down the drain, and we would not have the moderate reform of the Shipping Act that I think is so important. I hope at the appropriate time those who are managing the legislation, Senator Hutchison and others, will make a motion to table the Gorton amendment. I intend to support that motion to table and hope that in fact it is tabled and we can go along and proceed to final passage in an expedited fashion. 
Mr. President, we have been laboring long and hard over the past four years to reformulate, and further deregulate the ocean shipping industry. S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, reflects an effort to compromise the sometimes dissimilar interests of the international ocean shipping industry, from the ocean carriers and shippers and shipping intermediaries to the interests of U.S. ports and port-related labor interests such as longshoremen and truckers. The effort to provide further deregulation has been difficult due to some of the unique characteristics of international liner shipping. Currently, every nation affords ocean liner shipping companies an exemption from the relevant antitrust or competition policies that regulate competition for domestic companies. Given the need to provide some regulatory oversight to protect against abuse of the grant of antitrust immunity, it has been difficult to balance the desire for further deregulation. However, I feel that we have reached a workable agreement which almost all parties can support. 
It is safe to say that our ocean shipping industry affects all of us in the United States as currently 96% of our international trade is carried on board ships, but very few of us fully understand the ocean shipping industry. International ocean shipping is an over half a trillion dollar annual industry that is inextricably linked to our fortunes in international trade. It is a unique industry, in that international maritime trade is regulated by more than just the policies of the United States, in fact, it is regulated by every nation capable of accepting vessels that are navigated on the seven seas. It is a complex industry to understand because of the multinational nature of the trade, and its regulation is different from any of our domestic transportation industries such as trucking, rail, or aviation. 
The ocean shipping industry provides the most open and pure form of trade in international transportation. For instance, trucks and railroads are only allowed to operate on a domestic basis, and foreign trucks and railroads are required to stop at border locations, with cargo for points further inland transported by U.S. firms. International aviation is subject to restrictions imposed as a result of bilateral trade agreements, that is, foreign airlines can only come into the United States if bilateral trade agreements provide access into the United States. However, international maritime trade is not restricted at all, and treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation guarantee the right of vessels from anywhere in the world to deliver cargo to any point in the United States that is capable of accommodating the navigation of foreign vessels. 
The Federal Maritime Commission (`FMC') is charged with regulating the international ocean shipping liner industry. The ocean shipping liner industry consists of those vessels that provide regularly scheduled services to U.S. ports from points abroad, in large part, the trade consists of containerized cargo that is capable of being moved on an international basis. The Federal Maritime Commission does not regulate the practices of ocean shipping vessels that are not on regularly scheduled services, such as vessels chartered to carry oil or chemicals, or bulk grain or coal carriers. One might ask why regulate the ocean liner industry, and not bulk shipping industry? The answer is that the ocean liner industry enjoys a worldwide exemption from the application of U.S. antitrust laws and foreign competition policies. Also, the ocean liner industry is required to provide a system of `common carriage,' that is, our law requires carriers to provide service to any importer or exporter on a fair, and non-discriminatory basis. 
The international ocean shipping liner industry is not a healthy industry, in general, it is riddled with trade distorting practices, chronic over-capacity, and fiercely competitive carriers. In fact, rates have plunged in the trans-pacific trade to the degree that importers and exporters are expressing concerns about the overall health of the shipping industry. The primary cause of liner shipping overcapacity is the presence of international policies designed to promote national-flag carriers and also to ensure strong shipbuilding capacity in the interest of national security. These policies include subsidies to purchase ships and to operate ships, tax advantages to lower costs, cargo reservation schemes, and national control of shipyards and shipping companies. This results in an industry which is not completely driven by economic objectives. For instance, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, China Overseas Shipping Company (`COSCO') is operated by the government of China, much in the way the U.S. government controls the Navy, however, the government of China is not constrained by considerations that plague private sector companies. 
Historically, ocean shipping liner companies attempted to combat `rate wars' that had developed because of the situation of over-capacity by establishing shipping conferences to coordinate the practices and pricing policies of liner shipping companies. The first shipping conference was established in 1875, but it was not until 1916 that the U.S. government reviewed the conference system. The Alexander Committee (named after the then-Chairman of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries) recommended continuing the conference system in order to avoid ruinous `rate wars' and trade instability, but also determined that conference practices should be regulated to ensure that their practices did not adversely impact shippers. All other maritime nations allow shipping conferences to exist immune from the application of antitrust or competition laws, and presently 
no nation is considering changes to their shipping regulatory policies. 
In the past, U.S. efforts to apply antitrust principles to the ocean shipping liner industry were met with great difficulty, since foreign governments objected to the application of U.S. antitrust laws to the business interests of their shipping companies, and to the exclusion of their own laws on competition policy. Many nations have enacted blocking statutes to expressly prevent the application of U.S. antitrust laws to the practices of their shipping companies. As a result of these blocking statutes, U.S. antitrust laws would only be able to reach U.S. companies and would destroy their ability to compete with foreign companies. With the difficulties in applying our antitrust laws, U.S. ocean shipping policy has endeavored to regulate ocean shipping practices to ensure both that the grant of antitrust immunity is not abused and that our regulatory structure does not contradict the regulatory practices of foreign nations. 
The current regulatory statute that governs the practices of the ocean liner shipping industry, is the Shipping Act of 1984. The Shipping Act of 1984 was enacted in response to changing trends in the ocean shipping industry. The advent of intermodalism and containerization of cargo drastically changed the face of ocean shipping, and nearly all liner operations are now containerized. Prior to the Shipping Act of 1984, uncertainty existed as to whether intermodal agreements were within the scope of antitrust immunity granted to carriers. In addition, carrier agreements were subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny under a public interest-type of standard. Dissatisfaction with the regulatory structure led to hearings and legislative review in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the wake of passage of legislation deregulating the trucking and railroad industry, deregulation of the ocean shipping industry was accomplished with the enactment of the Shipping Act of 1984. 
The Shipping Act of 1984 continues antitrust immunity for agreements unless the FMC seeks an injunction against any agreement it finds `is likely, by a reduction of competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost.' The Act also clarifies that agreements can be filed covering intermodal movements, thus allowing ocean carriers to more fully coordinate ocean shipping services with shore-side services and surface transportation. One can easily measure the success of this provision, in examining the number of railroad double stack services, a rail service that was actually pioneered by U.S.-flag shipping companies, that have promulgated since the enactment of the Shipping Act of 1984. 
The Shipping Act of 1984 attempts to harmonize the twin objectives of facilitating an efficient ocean transportation system while controlling the potential abuses and disadvantages inherent in the conference system. The Act maintains the requirement that all carriers publish tariffs and provide rates and services to all shippers without unjust discrimination, thus continuing the obligations of common carriage. In order to provide shippers with a means of limiting conference power, the Shipping Act of 1984 made three major changes: (1) it allowed shippers to utilize service contracts, but required the essential terms of the contract to be filed and allowed similarly situated shippers the right to enter similar contracts; (2) it allowed shippers the right to set up shippers associations, in order to allow collective cargo interests to negotiate service contracts; and (3) it mandated that all conference carriers had the right to act independently of the conference in pricing or service options upon ten days' notice to the conference. 
Amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, and the passage of the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988, strengthened the FMC's oversight of foreign shipping practices and the practices of foreign governments that adversely impact conditions facing U.S. carriers and shippers in foreign trade. The FMC effectively utilized its trade authorities last year to challenge restrictive port practices in Japan, and after a tense showdown, convinced the Japanese to alter their practices that restrict the opportunity of carriers to operate their own marine terminals. The changes that will be required to be implemented under this agreement will save consumers of imports and exporters trading to Japan, millions of dollars, and the FMC deserves praise for hanging tough in what was undeniably a tense situation. 
Ten years later, after the enactment of the Shipping Act of 1984, we started anew on the process of providing a deregulated shipping environment to allow our shippers to become more competitive in international trade, and to provide more contractual flexibility to our ocean shipping companies. After four years of stops and starts, I think that we have reached a point where nearly all sectors of the maritime transportation community can get behind a common proposal for change. It has not been easy to balance the different interest involved in this legislation because of the competing differences of each of their needs, but I think that we have had each of the different sectors willing to give up a little of what they hoped to get in order to move the bill forward, and I would congratulate the private sector representatives for their willingness to compromise to move the process forward. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act moves forward to provide further deregulation to the ocean shipping industry, while at the 
same time, balancing the need for a degree of oversight given the continued provision of immunity from antitrust laws. The bill will not alter the structure of the FMC. The FMC is a small independent agency with an annual appropriation of $15 million which oversees over one half a trillion dollars of trade. It is important to note, that the agency's status of independence allows it to effectively fulfill its trade opening related functions without interference from other sorts of considerations. We had considered the possibility of merging the functions of the Federal Maritime Commission and the Surface Transportation Board, but ultimately concluded that the combination of the two agencies did not save the taxpayer anything because the agencies would have no real overlap of responsibility. 
One of the major problems in moving forward with legislative change in this area was the need to provide additional service contract flexibility and confidentiality, while balancing the need to continue oversight of contract practices to ensure against anti-competitive practices immunized from our antitrust laws. I think the contracting proposal embodied in S. 414 adequately balances these competing considerations. The bill transfers the requirements of providing service and price information to the private sector, and will allow the private sector to perform functions that had heretofore been provided by the government. The bill broadens the authority of the FMC to provide statutory exemptions, and reforms the licensing and bonding requirements for ocean shipping intermediaries. 
I have been contacted by Senators Lautenberg and Moynihan about their concerns for the freight forwarding community, and their desire to set mandatory or reasonable compensation for forwarding services provided under a shipping contract. While we were unable to provide a legal requirement for forwarder compensation, I would urge the FMC to continue to be vigilent to ensure that forwarders and forwarding expertise is not jeopardized in this new and more deregulated environment. The forwarding community provides valuable expertise to the shipping community and I will continue to monitor the impacts of this legislation to ensure that it does not adversely impact forwarders. Additionally, we were able to provide less stringent report guidance about what sort of activity should be monitored by the FMC to ensure against unjust discrimination against shipping intermediaries at the request of Senator Harkin, and I would like to thank him for his imput on this legislation. 
Importantly, the bill does not change the structure of the Federal Maritime Commission. The FMC is a small agency with a annual budget of about 14 million dollars. When you subtract penalties and fines collected over the past seven years, the annual cost of agency operations is less than $7 million. All told, the agency is a bargain to the U.S. taxpayer as it oversees the shipping practices of over $500 billion in maritime trade. Added benefit to the U.S. public accrues when the FMC is able to break down trade barriers that cost importers and exporters millions in additional costs, such as what recently occurred when the FMC challenged restrictive Japanese port practices. 
The FMC is an independent regulatory agency that is not accountable to the direction of the administration. Independency allows the FMC to maintain a more aggressive and objective posture when it comes to the consideration of eliminating foreign trade barriers. When we first assessed the issue of agency structure we considered appending the functions of the FMC to a new enlarged Surface Transportation Board (`STB'). However, the functions performed by the STB are quite different than the FMC functions that would remain after implementation of the deregulatory changes provided in S. 414 and the Congressional Budget Office did not estimate any savings through a merger approach. Additionally, the initial proposal to merge the functions of the FMC and the STB would have run afoul of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. Ultimately, we decided to pursue solely the needed regulatory changes, and not needlessly alter the structure of the agency for no real purpose.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would just, as we move toward a vote on this measure, make one other comment, and that is that it is very clear that there is a great deal of support for the current bill that is on the floor. And there is pretty much across-the-board opposition to the amendment that Senator Gorton is offering. And it is across the board in the sense that it is opposed by all segments of the industry.

Mr. BREAUX. The letter basically says that: 
We understand that Senator Slade Gorton plans to offer an amendment . . . that would alter current law and allow non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCCs) to offer confidential service contracts directly to the proprietary owners of the cargo. Some interests have argued that the retention of current law would disadvantage smaller volume shippers who might utilize [the non-vessel operating common carriers] in order to obtain competitive rates with larger volume shippers. 
They point out: 
However, the perceived benefits that smaller shippers might receive from the ability of NVOCCs to enter into service contracts with their customers is largely misunderstood. Under current law, NVOCCs are allowed to enter into service contracts with carriers and this can generate a significant cost savings that is passed onto shippers. This would not change under the latest version of S. 414. NVOCCs would however benefit from the provisions allowing confidentiality of certain terms in their contracts with carriers. Smaller volume shippers would also have the option to consolidate their cargoes by joining shippers associations who may then negotiate lower rates as larger volume shippers. 
The point is pretty clear that this group opposes the amendment of the Senator from Washington. I would like to list for the Record the ones who have signed this letter because it indeed is significant, and that is across-the-board opposition. 
It is signed by the American Association of Port Authorities; by American President Lines, Limited; by the Council of European and Japanese Shipowners' Associations; by the Crowley Maritime Corporation, a major shipping company; the International Longshoremen's Association; by The Chamber of Shipping of America; by The National Industrial Transportation League; by Sea-Land Service, one of the largest carriers in the world; by the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO. 
So whether you are talking about the workers who handle the cargo, or by the port authorities who have the cargo shipped through their ports, or by the ship carriers who are actually carrying the cargo, it is pretty unanimous agreement that this is not the right thing to do. 
Let us support the compromise. Everything in that compromise is a positive step forward. It may not be as much as some would want, but it is far better than the current law. It allows some more decontrol, allows some more deregulation, more competition. And that is good. But it is simply unfair to say to people who have no responsibility for owning ships or the expense of running ships that they are going to allow them to have the same advantages as a shipping company does. 
It simply would break the balance in this industry, which I think is very important to preserve. 
I think the bill is a good bill. It took 4 years to get us to this point. These compromises were not entered into behind the scenes, but were debated on a regular basis among all the active participants. This is a good bill. It should be passed. The Gorton amendment should be tabled.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Gorton amendment, which would give non-vessel-operating common carriers, or NVOs, the right to offer service contracts to shippers--that is, the importers and exporters--just as do vessel-operating ocean common carriers. NVOs do not own or operate vessels. They are middlemen, who act as carriers in relation to their shipper customers, and who then act as shippers when they offer those cargoes to vessel-operating carriers for transport. NVOs were first legislatively recognized as a legal entity in the 1984 Shipping Act, in recognition that NVOs can provide specialized attention and service to small shippers whose minimal cargo volumes are not always worth the time and attention of large vessel-operating carriers. No other nation has legally recognized the concept of non-vessel-owner-common carriers. 
Originally, NVOs consolidated the cargoes of several shippers into a container and then took advantage of the full container rates offered by ocean carriers. There are thousands of NVOs doing business in the United States, all of whom are required to file their rates, to adhere to their rates, and to be bonded to establish their financial responsibility to their customers. It should be noted that S. 414 will reduce the cost of tariff filing by eliminating the requirement that the federal government collect and disseminate tariff information, and would replace this system with a requirement that tariff information be publicly available through a private sector resource, such as the internet or other private sector information system provider. 
This system has been working well for 14 years. There is no reason to change it. Small shippers--with only the occasional box or two of cargo to be transported--have come to depend on NVOs for the care and personal attention that a larger carrier cannot offer. But some NVOs have grown immeasurably in size, primarily those that are based in Europe, and are now competing directly for cargo with the major U.S. and foreign shipping lines. It is precisely these NVOs who are not satisfied with their current status, and insist that despite the fact that they have none of the expenses attendant to actually operating vessels, want to be treated like a vessel-operating common carrier in every respect. They want to offer service contracts to shippers and groups of shippers who can afford to promise large volumes of cargo in return for more favorable rates. 
It is not fair to the vessel-operating common carriers serving our trades, with their huge capital investments, that they be put on par with entities taking advantage of the fiction of current law calling them carriers. And it is especially not fair that the small `mom and pop' NVOs, who are not in a position to compete with some of the NVO giants that have emerged, may be swallowed up by them if the larger ones are allowed to offer service contracts. Small NVOs, by virtue of the modest cargoes they handle, will not be able to take advantage of the Gorton amendment; only the mega-companies will. America's small businesses do not deserve this treatment. This amendment is not about protecting the interests of small business, it is actually about treating large multinational forwarding companies the same way that we would ocean carriers. The end result would be to provide a disincentive to actually own and operate ships. Why actually own and operate ships if you could function in the same fashion as an ocean carrier without actually having to own or control any of the transportion functions or liabilities. 
Moreover, S. 414, as revised by the Hutchison, Lott, Breaux amendment, represents a delicately crafted compromise reflecting the interests of all sectors of the shipping industry, including vessel- and non-vessel-operating common carriers, as well as shipper, forwarder, port and labor interests. The resulting documents cannot be altered in a piecemeal fashion without upsetting that balance. No one in this compromise got exactly and completely what was wanted; everyone won a little and lost a little. That's what a compromise is. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against destroying several years of hard work to come up with a fair and viable revision of our shipping laws. I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Hutchison, Lott and Gorton for all of the work that they have put into this measure, and I urge you to vote against the Gorton amendment.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Coverdell today in introducing the `Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1998'. 
My primary reason for sponsoring the bill with the Senator from Georgia is to make the federal Clean Water Act equitable by requiring that it apply to and be enforced against the federal government. 
Currently, states, local governments and the private sector do not have immunity from the act's enforcement. By the same principle, the federal government should not be granted such immunity from the clean water statute and this bill provides that parity. 
The bill also provides that the federal government would be subject to all the same enforcement mechanisms that apply to states, local governments and the private sector under the Clean Water Act. 
Fairness, safety, public health and environmental protection all dictate that Federal agencies should be held to the same standards for water pollution prevention and control as apply to states, local governments and the private sector. 
Equity is ensured by the Coverdell-Breaux bill because all levels of government and the private sector would be treated the same under the Clean Water Act's enforcement programs. No one would be allowed immunity. 
To paraphrase a well-known adage, what's good for states, local governments and the private sector in terms of clean water should be good for the federal government. 
In addition to the provisions stated previously, the Coverdell-Breaux bill reflects the adage's fairness principle in another fashion. 
The bill would hold the federal government accountable to comply not only with its own clean water statute, but also with state and local clean water laws. Again, equity would be upheld. And, safety, public health and environmental protection would be strengthened. 
Other provisions are contained as well in the legislation which Senator Coverdell and I are introducing today. For example the EPA administrator, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Transportation would be authorized to pursue administrative enforcement actions under the Clean Water Act against any non-complying federal agencies. It also includes provisions for federal employees' personal liability under the act's civil and criminal penalty provisions and a requirement that the federal government pay reasonable service charges when complying with clean water laws. 
Over the past 25 years, the United States has made dramatic advances in protecting the environment as a result of the Clean Water Act. We have all benefitted as a result. 
Today, I encourage other Senators to join Senator Coverdell and I as cosponsors of the bill to bring equity to the clean water program and to make possible the expansion of its public and private benefits.

Mr. BREAUX. I thank Senator Gregg for his unwavering leadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past year. I also want to thank Chairman Roth for his leadership. Times have certainly changed since the days when no one would even talk about Social Security reform. Today, we have key members of the Senate presenting innovative ideas about how to address the looming liabilities of the Social Security program. I applaud Chairman Roth's efforts because he is moving this debate forward. 
This is critical because the motto must be `sooner rather than later'. There is no better time to tackle entitlement reform than during good economic times. While SS's financing is projected to pay full benefits until 2029--the strain on the Federal budget will begin much earlier, only 10 years from now. The Social Security Advisory Council could not agree on an approach to reform Social Security; however, they all agreed that early action should be taken. This call has been echoed time and time again by the General Accounting Office, Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as well as most other experts. 
The budget resolution already contains Sense of the Senate language regarding the budget surplus and Social Security reform. It reads as follows: `Congress should use unified budget surpluses to reform Social Security for future generations . . .' I support Chairman Roth's Sense of the Senate because it takes this language a step further. It suggests that individual accounts are the direction in which Social Security reform should move. I agree with this. 
The American people will hear again and again over the next several months about the financial instability of Social Security--about the promises made that we can no longer afford to keep. Americans will also hear about what is necessary to put Social Security on sound financial footing--the difficult sacrifices and the tough choices. This dialogue will only compound the already low level of confidence most Americans have in our nation's public retirement system. I adamantly believe we must do something to reverse this trend. We must provide some good news in the middle of this debate. If we include individual accounts within Social Security reform we are giving all Americans a new chance to provide substantial retirement savings for themselves--that is the good news. 
This Sense of the Senate does not dictate or even suggest how these individual accounts should be administered or that they be done independently of fundamental Social Security reform. Senator Gregg and I have our own ideas about how Social Security should be reformed and, specifically, how individual accounts should be set-up and administered. I look forward to our ideas being discussed and debated during the coming weeks and months, along with all the other ideas being put on the table. The Aging Committee, which I am pleased to serve as Ranking Member, is looking at this issue closely. I hope the Finance Committee will hold hearings as soon as May. 
In looking to Social Security reform we cannot lose sight of the larger budget picture and the difficult steps we have taken in this Congress to get our country's books in order. What we tried to do with the balanced budget--and what we should be trying to do with the surplus--is reduce this country's overall financial liabilities. As stated in the budget resolution, Social Security's unfunded liability stands at around $3 trillion. Obviously, Social Security is a large part of this country's debt and must be addressed. Again, it must be addressed sooner rather than later. In conclusion, I want to again thank Chairman Roth and Senator Gregg for their efforts in moving this debate forward.

Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair. 
I want to start off by commending both of the speakers who have previously spoken on this issue, especially Senator Moynihan. 
Social Security has always been referred to as the third rail of politics. I might add that Medicare is probably also a part of that third rail. The theory was that, if you touch it 
politically, you die. I mean, you can't talk about it because it has always been too controversial with all the groups and organizations around the country that, if you ever tried to change anything in the area of Social Security, people will kill you politically. 
We are running out of options in 1998. Unless some changes are made, the program is not going to be there. It is not going to exist. I commend Senator Moynihan for his courage and for his intelligence and for his long history of involvement in this particular area, talking about not just what the situation is today, but talking about the future, and is it going to be there for our children and our grandchildren? 
People who are in retirement programs today are in good shape from the standpoint of knowing the program is going to be there for the rest of their lives. What we are really talking about, however, is, is it going to be there for their children and grandchildren and future generations? 
This is not 1935. I mean, when the program was designed by President Roosevelt and Congress, in those days it was a program that really was targeted to what was happening at that time. I commend particularly the recommendations of the senior Senator from New York that we have a program that now establishes or allows people to establish individual accounts. That is very, very important. 
We invest the Social Security trust funds in Government securities. You know how much money we get for their investments? About 2.3 percent. That is not a good investment. We are only getting a 2.3 percent, on average, return from the Social Security investments. That does not make sense in 1998. When the stock market is increasing at a 15 percent rate of return, we should be allowing people to participate in something that will give them more money back than 2.3 percent which we get now for Social Security investments. 
The second thing that allows, as I understand it, is patterned after the thrift savings accounts which we have an opportunity to do as Federal employees. Every Federal employee, including myself as a Senator, and House Members, all Federal employees have an option of putting their retirement moneys into a high-risk plan or a moderate-risk plan or a low-risk plan with no risk at all but a lower return, in order to build up our savings. That is much better, in my opinion, than Social Security retirees have with the 2.3 percent return with regard to the Social Security retirement plan. 
Here is the problem. Social Security today is pay as you go. The problem is, we have fewer people paying and more people going. We have fewer people contributing the money and more and more people going into retirement. So we have a pay-as-you-go system, but there are fewer and fewer people paying and more and more people going. 
What do I mean by that? It is very simple. In 1950, there were 16.5 people paying for every one person going into retirement. Today, we have about three people paying for every one person going. In the year 2030, there are going to be only two people paying for every person going. 
We have 77 million baby boomers who are getting ready to go. They are going into retirement starting in 2010. The question is, do we have enough people paying for all of those people that are going? The answer is clearly no. 
So I very much congratulate the senior Senator from New York and Senator Kerrey from Nebraska for having the political courage to come to the floor and talk about this. 
One of my concerns is that it is voluntary. I think I would like to take it a step further and say you have to, if you are going to get a tax cut, you have to put it into an individual retirement account. 
I am concerned a lot of people may take the money, the dough, and not put it into a savings account. But we still have the obligation to take care of their retirement. I think we need to talk about that. I mean, I think you are right on target and are moving in the right direction. This is a major contribution to something that we spend too little time addressing.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last Friday, March 6, the newly appointed National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare held its first meeting. Chaired by myself and Congressman Bill Thomas, Administrative Chairman, the commission was established by last year's balanced budget agreement to thoroughly study and assess the entire program--top to bottom--and make specific recommendations to Congress and the Administration for fundamental Medicare reform. Our target deadline for getting these bipartisan, consensus recommendations in your hands is March 1, 1999. 
When I say consensus here, I mean that any recommendation we put forward will have received 11 votes--a super majority of the 17 commission members. I remain optimistic that our recommendations will receive an even higher level of support than that required under the statute. Every member of the commission recognizes how very important it is for us to succeed in coming up with something that can be passed by Congress and signed into law. 
I think we got the commission's work off to a very good start. We are just beginning what promises to be an exciting year as we come together to protect and preserve a program that we all agree has served us well over the last 33 years. But we also have to face the reality that if Medicare is to be there for another 33 years and beyond, we must look beyond the program's financial solvency and address issues like quality, equity, and efficiency as well.

Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to discuss with you and my distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, our proposal to establish a nationally-level set-aside program from the federal highway trust fund to help states to finance certain types of nationaliy-significant intermodal projects, of which Louisiana has several. 
We appreciate your consideration of our proposal, Mr. President, to set aside $100 million for the fiscal years 1998-2003 for obligation by the Secretary for intermodal projects. We want to continue working closely with you and other members on its behalf when the Senate and House go to conference on the surface transportation bill. 
Congress acted wisely in the 1991 ISTEA by creating the National Highway System, NHS, which brought focus to intermodalism as part of the nation's surface transportation policy. In addition to the NHS account, funds from the Surface Transportation Program (STP) may be used by the states for intermodal projects. The use of NHS and STP funds for intermodal projects are left to the discretion of the states and intermodal projects are but one option available to them. 
I also hope that funds authorized for the Trade Corridor and Border Crossing Planning and Infrastructure Program in S. 1173 will be available for use on intermodal projects in port areas and for transportation systems which connect to ports. Equal emphasis needs to be given in this program to intermodal projects in states such as Louisiana, where the combination of ports, waterways, roads, rail and airports constitute some of the finest examples of intermodalism on a national and international scale. 
As helpful as these three programs have the potential to be under ISTEA II for nationally-significant intermodal projects, more funding is needed to help the states build them. 
For example, the New Orleans Regional Intermodal Project brings together in a matter of a few square miles major rail, water, air and highway transportation centers. This project is designed to increase the transportation efficiency of the entire metropolitan area, including the Parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, St. Tammany, St. Bernard, and St. Charles. 
The New Orleans Regional Intermodal Project represents a unique implementation 
program focused on closer integration of several highway, port, rail, and air facilities in the Earhart corridor, from the Tchoupitoulas port complex on the Mississippi River to the new Air/Cargo facilities at New Orleans International Airport. 
This initiative is as important to the nation as it is to the New Orleans metropolitan area. Because of its geographic location, the area is the hub for several national cargo transportation systems. This relatively small area is the juncture point between several major north/south and east/west railroad lines; two major north/south and east/west interstate highways; a major international cargo and passenger airport; and two of the most significant waterway systems in the country, the Mississippi River and the Intracoastal Waterway. 
When one combines the services and impact of the intermodal complexes at Baton Rouge and the Port of South of Louisiana at LaPlace, each of which should be considered for this type of funding, with those of the New Orleans regional complex, then the order of magnitude and impact truly is one of international as well as national significance. 
In a similar manner, other Louisiana intermodal projects with national significance should be considered. These include: Much-needed improvements to Louisiana Highway 1, from the mammoth Port Fourchon area on the Gulf of Mexico to U.S. Highway 90, because of the major contribution this route is playing in the development of oil and gas fields in the Gulf; this intermodal complex is increasing the delivery of domestic energy supplies and strengthening national security by limiting national dependency on fuel imports; highways, waterways and pipelines make Port Fourchon one of the most important intermodal complexes in the nation today and Louisiana Highway 1 a major roadway which connects the Gulf of Mexico to other major intermodal systems via U.S. Highway 90; developments in the Central and Northwest Louisiana regions, which include the growing highway, port, rail, water and air complexes along the Red River, starting at the Caddo-Bossier Port, continuing to the Ports of Natchitoches and Alexandria, and finally linking with the Mississippi River; this link brings together goods and services from the Central and Midwestern United States to the water, rail, air and highway systems leading to and from the Mississippi River and its internationally-significant intermodal systems; Barksdale Air Force Base, located at the juncture of two major interstate systems in the Shreveport-Bossier City area of Louisiana, and home of the 8th Air Force, together with Ft. Polk, home of the Army's Joint Readiness Training Center, located at Leesville, Louisiana, are major military installations in the state. It is critical that strategic national defense installations such as these have the proper access and connections to transportation systems, including roads, rail and waterways, to respond effectively in time of need. An intermodal set-aside at the 
national level would be another means to help the states address the transportation system needs for these military installations. 
It is hoped, Mr. President, that the type of fund we envision could also be used to provide additional funding for critical projects such as extending Interstate 49 in Louisiana, from its current Southern terminus at Lafayette to New Orleans. 
An extension of I-49 from Lafayette to New Orleans is much-needed from a national perspective because of the benefits it would bring by linking goods and services from the Central and Midwestern United States to the New Orleans region's intermodal complexes. 
As important, the extension of I-49 from Lafayette to New Orleans would link the expanding energy industry at Port Fourchon and the trade from other ports along that route, such as the Ports of Iberia, West St. Mary, and Morgan City, to the New Orleans region's intermodal systems. Tying into that system, too, could be trade from the port at Abbeville, just south of Lafayette. 
I-49 also connects with Interstate 10, a major interstate corridor which runs from Florida to California. In Louisiana, I-10 westbound from Lafayette has ports which connect directly or indirectly to it, such as the major Port of Lake Charles, and those at Cameron and Mermentau. 
The full benefits of these surface transportation systems cannot be fully realized without an investment in the roadways and connectors that will allow true intermodalism. The Louisiana intermodal complexes and systems represent the best opportunity for this nation to leverage a small investment in infrastructure to gain major dividends in efficiency that will benefit our entire national economy.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to amend Title 28 of the U.S. Code to create two divisions in the Eastern Judicial District of Louisiana: a New Orleans Division, which would be comprised of Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, Saint Charles, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington Parishes; and a Houma Division, which would be comprised of Terrebonnne, Lafourche, Saint James, and Assumption Parishes. 
It has long been recognized that there is a distinct need for a permanent United States District Court Judge in Houma, Louisiana. The Houma-Thibodaux metropolitan area is the fourth largest in Louisiana, and the area is growing by leaps and bounds, due in no small part to a revitalized oil and gas industry. With this increase in population and commercial activity, the number of court cases filed in the area will likewise grow. 
This inevitable increase in litigation will mean that an increasing number of people from the Houma-Thibodaux area will be forced to travel to New Orleans to appear in federal district court. This is a difficult, congested, and time-consuming trip. Also, many of the rural areas in the Eastern Judicial District have easier access to Houma than they do to New Orleans. Because of these factors, it makes sense to provide residents of the Houma-Thibodaux area and the surrounding, rural areas access to a federal district court closer to home. 
A brand new federal courthouse already exists for this very purpose. The George M. Arceneaux Federal Courthouse in Houma, Louisiana, was dedicated for use by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Unfortunately, this new courthouse is not being used as originally intended. Judges have difficulty making the trip from New Orleans to Houma. As a result, Houma area residents must travel to New Orleans and the new courthouse remains severely under-used. 
It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that I offer this legislation today. I also want to note that the Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, Saint James, and 29th Judicial District Court Bar Associations have all passed resolutions expressing their support for this legislation. Furthermore, the bill contains language to ensure that neither pending cases nor summoned, impaneled, or actually serving juries will be affected by the change. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this bill.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senate for accepting the Bond-Breaux amendment to S. 1173. It has been my privilege to cosponsor the proposal with the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, and to continue our work together on wetlands-related issues. 
I express my deepest appreciation to the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and to the Committee Chairman and Ranking Member, Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, for their support. I also look forward to working with them on this issue as the intermodal surface transportation bill advances through Congress. 
The Bond-Breaux amendment proposes to establish a reasonable, responsible wetlands and natural habitat mitigation policy as part of the federal aid highway program. 
Our language says that mitigation banking shall be the preferred means, to the maximum extent practicable, to mitigate for wetlands or natural habitat which are affected as part of a federal-aid highway project and whose mitigation is paid for with federal funds. 
The amendment establishes three criteria which are to be met in order to use a mitigation bank: first, the affected wetlands or natural habitat are to be in a bank's service area; second, the bank has to have enough credits available to offset the impact; and third, the bank has to meet federally-approved standards. 
The Bond-Breaux amendment does not mandate the use of mitigation banks nor does it say they shall be the sole means or the only method used to mitigate for wetlands or natural habitat affected by a federal-aid highway project. 
Mitigation banks can offer advantages when built and operated responsibly, including achieving economies of scale and providing larger, higher-quality diverse habitat. 
Again, I'm pleased to join with Senator Bond in sponsoring the amendment, pleased that it has been accepted as part of S. 1173, and appreciative of the support extended for it by Senator Lott, Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I too am pleased to report on the successful efforts to prepare S. 414 for Senate passage. I would concur with the Majority Leader that the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement bill is badly needed and I believe it is long overdue. I am hopeful that the progress made on S. 414 would provide momentum to pass the OECD Shipbuilding Trade Agreement implementing legislation. 
At the end of the last session, we prepared a draft Senate floor manager's amendment to this bill and circulated it within the industry and to members of the Senate. That draft manager's amendment was helpful in moving S. 414 along, but it also continued to present some serious problems to various sectors of the maritime community. 
Accordingly, over the past several months, representatives of those affected maritime sectors have worked to find an acceptable solution and to resolve their differences. With the Commerce Committee staff's help and guidance, a package of modifications to that original manager's amendment have been agreed upon. 
The diverse segments of the industry--U.S. ocean carriers, foreign ocean carriers, shippers, labor, and the ports--are now in agreement on how to reform and reduce government's role in international ocean transportation. More importantly, all these industry sectors have agreed on meaningful deregulation of the ocean shipping industry to allow greater choice, flexibility, and competition in this transportation mode. 
Let me say that again. Mr. President, all these industry sectors are now in agreement. Although it is a delicate balance, it is still an agreement. 
This agreement will lead to greater efficiency in providing ocean transportation services to U.S. importers and exporters, and will benefit American consumers. U.S. importers and exporters will now, under the reforms of S. 414, be able to enter into more comprehensive and productive contractual relationships with ocean carriers. At the same time, S. 414 provides important protections for ports and labor which will safeguard their interests in a more deregulated environment.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Future Business Leaders of America--Phi Beta Lambda (FBLA-PBL) for fifty-six years of service to America's students, teachers, businesses, and communities. During the week of February 8-14, educators, students, and business professionals across the country recognized National FBLA-PBL Week. I think this is a wonderful time for us to look back on the accomplishments of this organization, whose legacy leaves a strong foundation for education and the future of American enterprise. 
On February 3, 1942, Dr. Hamden L. Forkner spearheaded the effort to create the first FBLA chapter in Johnson City, Tennessee. Dr. Forkner envisioned a national organization that would train high school students in the real-life aspects of the professional business world, and also develop their leadership, self-confidence, and patriotism. The FBLA concept quickly expanded, and membership grew many times over. 
In 1958, the benefits of FBLA were extended to postsecondary students with the creation of Phi Beta Lambda. This professional business organization seeks to ease the transition from school to work for thousands of students by providing training in business leadership skills and connecting students with current industry leaders. 
Over the years, FBLA-PBL has grown to encompass two additional divisions: a Professional Division, founded in 1989, for their partners, supporters and alumni; and the Middle Level, founded just a few years ago, which connects middle school and junior high students with basic leadership and business principles. 
The mission of the FBLA-PBL is to bring business and education together in a positive working relationship through innovative leadership and career development programs. They accomplish this through a variety of national programs, including seven national leadership conferences, over seventy competitive events, strategic business partnerships, career expos, and community service. 
Mr. President, in the past fifty-six years, FBLA-PBL has trained literally millions of today's leaders in American business. For fifty years now, Louisiana has benefited from the FBLA-PBL and today, there are approximately 7,000 members in my home state. I am proud to say that the National Phi Beta Lambda President is from Louisiana. This is truly an organization that has made a positive impact on my home state as well as on our country, proving that our youth are ready, willing, and able to take the reins of leadership and help guide us toward a brighter tomorrow. With over 240,000 members annually, FBLA-PBL is a shining example of what makes America great, and I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize them for their efforts. I would like to take this opportunity for all of us to recognize and remember that FBLA-PBL has done a tremendous service for this country.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would suspend the current duty on ink-jet textile printing machinery through December 31, 1999. I would like to make some brief comments about this bill. 
It is my understanding that this machinery is not made in the United States, so there are no domestic producers that are likely to be harmed by this bill. Furthermore, the revenues currently generated by the duty on these machines are under $500,000 per annum, making it a de minimis amount under budget rules. This being the case, Mr. President, I think my colleagues will agree that this bill is not apt to have any detrimental effects on domestic industry or federal revenue. 
In fact, I believe such a measure could represent a potential economic benefit for the textile industry. These ink-jet printing machines are used to print patterns and designs on fabrics, and they are indispensable for a large part of our domestic textile industry. They are also extremely costly. It stands to reason that every little bit we can do for our domestic textile producers to reduce their costs of production help them to be competitive in this increasingly global economy. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill with no substantial costs involved, and I want to encourage my colleagues to support it.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this legislation reflects an effort to reach a compromise within the international ocean shipping industry. It reflects a middle ground among the somewhat dissimilar interests of the ocean carriers and shippers and shipping intermediaries, as well as the interests of U.S. ports and post-related labor interests such as longshoremen and truckers. I have worked with Senators Hutchison, Lott, and Gorton to craft a compromise allowing us to move forward with legislation. I had hoped to be able to move forward with floor consideration before we adjourn, but it appears now that we ran out of time on this bill. I look forward to taking this bill up early in the next session of Congress. It has been very difficult to balance the competing considerations affected by this bill. In fact, I would liken it to squeezing Jell-O, you push in one direction and objections would ooze out in the other direction. However, I feel certain that we are close to achieving a workable agreement that all parties can support. 
It is safe to say that our ocean shipping industry affects all of us in the United States since 96 percent of our international trade is carried by ships, but very few of us fully understand the ocean shipping industry. International ocean shipping is a half-a-trillion-dollar annual industry that is inextricably linked to our fortunes in international trade. It is a unique industry, in that international maritime trade is regulated by more than just the policies of the United States. In fact, it is regulated by every nation capable of accepting vessels that are navigated on the seven seas. It is a complex industry to understand because of the multinational nature of trade, and its regulation is different from any of our domestic transportation industries such as trucking, rail, or aviation. 
The ocean shipping industry provides the most open and pure form of trade in international transportation. For instance, trucks and railroads are only allowed to operate on a domestic basis, and foreign trucks and railroads are required to stop at border locations, with cargo for points further inland transported by U.S. firms. International aviation is subject to restrictions imposed and a result of bilateral trade agreements, that is, foreign airlines can only come into the United States if bilateral trade agreements provide access into the United States. However, international maritime trade is not restricted at all, and treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation guarantee the right of vessels from anywhere in the world to deliver cargo to any point in the United States that is capable of accommodating the navigation of foreign vessels. 
The Federal Maritime Commission [FMC] is charged with regulating the international ocean shipping liner industry. The ocean shipping liner industry consists of those vessels that provide regularly scheduled services to U.S. ports from points abroad. In large part, the trade consists of containerized cargo that is capable of international movement. The FMC does not regulate the practices of ocean shipping vessels that are not on regularly scheduled services, such as vessels chartered to carry oil, chemicals, bulk grain, or coal carriers. One might ask why regulate the ocean liner industry, and not the bulk shipping industry? The answer is that the ocean liner industry enjoys a worldwide exemption from the application of U.S. antitrust laws and foreign competition policies. Also, the ocean liner industry is required to provide a system of common carriage, that is, our law requires carriers to provide service to any importer or exporter on a fair, and nondiscriminatory basis. 
The international ocean shipping liner industry is not a healthy industry. In general, it is riddled with trade-distorting practices, chronic overcapacity, and fiercely competitive carriers. In fact, rates have plunged in the transpacific trade to the degree that importers and exporters are expressing concerns about the overall health of the shipping industry. The primary cause of liner shipping overcapacity is the presence of policies designed to promote national-flag carriers and also to ensure strong shipbuilding capacity in the interest of national security. These policies which are not necessarily economically effective include subsidies to purchase ships and to operate ships, tax advantages to lower costs, cargo reservation schemes, and national control of shipyards and shipping companies. A prime example of policies that promote and subsidize a national-flag carrier is one of the largest shipping companies in the world, the China Overseas Shipping Company [COSCO]. It is operated by the Government of China, much in the way the United States Government controls the Navy and is not constrained by considerations that plague private sector companies. 
Historically, ocean shipping liner companies attempted to combat rate wars resulting from overcapacity by establishing shipping conferences to coordinate the practices and pricing policies of liner shipping companies. The first shipping conference was established in 1875, but it was not until 1916 that the U.S. Government reviewed the conference system. The Alexander Committee--named after the then-chairman of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries--recommended continuing the conference system in order to avoid ruinous rate wars and trade instability, but also determined that conference practices should be regulated to ensure that their practices did not adversely impact shippers. All other maritime nations allow shipping conferences to exist without the constraints of antitrust or competition laws, and presently no nation is considering changes to their shipping regulatory policies. 
In the past, U.S. efforts to apply antitrust principles to the ocean shipping liner industry were met with great difficulty. Understandably, foreign governments objected to applying U.S. antitrust laws instead of their own laws on competition policy to their shipping companies. Many nations have enacted blocking statutes to expressly prevent the application of U.S. antitrust laws to the practices of their shipping companies. As a result of these blocking statutes, U.S. antitrust laws would only be able to reach U.S. companies and would destroy their ability to compete with foreign companies. With the difficulties in applying our antitrust laws, U.S. ocean shipping policy has endeavored to regulate ocean shipping practices to ensure that the grant of antitrust immunity is not abused and that our regulatory structure does not contradict the regulatory practices of foreign nations. 
The current regulatory statute that governs the practices of the ocean liner shipping industry is the Shipping Act of 1984. The Shipping Act of 1984 was enacted in response to changing trends in the ocean shipping industry. The advent of intermodalism and containerization of cargo drastically changed 
the face of ocean shipping, and nearly all liner operations are now containerized. Prior to the Shipping Act of 1984, uncertainty existed as to whether intermodal agreements were within the scope of antitrust immunity granted to carriers. In addition, carrier agreements were subject to lengthy regulatory scrutiny under a public interest-type of standard. Dissatisfaction with the regulatory structure led to hearings and legislative review in the late 1970's and early 1980's. In the wake of passage of legislation deregulating the trucking and railroad industry, deregulation of the ocean shipping industry was accomplished with the enactment of the Shipping Act of 1984. 
The Shipping Act of 1984 continues antitrust immunity for agreements unless the FMC seeks an injunction against any agreement it finds `is likely, by a reduction of competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost.' The act also clarifies that agreements can be filed covering intermodal movements, thus allowing ocean carriers to more fully coordinate ocean shipping services with shore-side services and surface transportation. 
The Shipping Act of 1984 attempts to harmonize the twin objectives of facilitating an efficient ocean transportation system while controlling the potential abuses and disadvantages inherent in the conference system. The Act maintains the requirement that all carriers publish tariffs and provide rates and services to all shippers without unjust discrimination, thus continuing the obligations of common carriage. In order to provide shippers with a means of limiting conference power, the Shipping Act of 1984 made three major changes: First, it allowed shippers to utilize service contracts, but required the essential terms of the contract to be filed and allowed similarly situated shippers the right to enter similar contracts; second, it allowed shippers the right to set up shippers associations, in order to allow collective cargo interests to negotiate service contracts; and third, it mandated that all conference carriers had the right to act independently of the conference in pricing or service options upon 10 days' notice to the conference. 
Amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, and the passage of the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988, strengthened the FMC's oversight of foreign shipping practices and the practices of foreign governments that adversely impact conditions facing U.S. carriers and shippers in foreign trade. The FMC effectively utilized its trade authorities to challenge restrictive port practices in Japan, and after a tense showdown convinced the Japanese to alter their practices that restrict the opportunity of carriers to operate their own marine terminals. The changes that will be required to be implemented under this agreement will save consumers of imports and exporters trading to Japan, millions of dollars, and the FMC deserves praise for hanging tough in what was undeniably a tense situation. 
While we were not able to address all concerns about our new ocean shipping deregulation proposal I would like to elaborate on the progress that has been made toward ultimate Senate passage of legislation. I would also like to thank Senators Hutchison, Lott and Gorton for their efforts on this bill. Additionally, the following staffers spent many hours meeting with the affected members of the shipping public and listening to their concerns about our proposal and I would like to personally thank Jim Sartucci and Carl Bentzel of the Commerce Committee staff, Carl Biersack of Senator Lott's staff, Jeanne Bumpus of Senator Gorton's staff, Amy Henderson of Senator Hutchison's staff as well as my own staffers, Mark Ashby and Paul DeVeau.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished senior Senator from the State of Mississippi, Senator Cochran, in introducing the Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act. I believe it is legislation all of our colleagues should support. 
As members of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Senator Cochran and I recognize the importance of protecting and conserving migratory bird populations and habitat. 
Eighty years ago, Congress enacted the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which implemented the 1916 Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds between Great Britain, for Canada, and the United States. Since then, the United States, Mexico, and the former Soviet Union have signed similar agreements. The Convention and the Act are designed to protect and manage migratory birds and regulate the taking of that renewable resource. They have had a positive impact, and we have maintained viable migratory bird populations despite the loss of natural habitat because of human activities. 
Since passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and development of the regulatory program, several issues have been raised and resolved. One has not--the issue concerning the hunting of migratory birds `[b]y the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area.' 
A doctrine has developed in the federal courts by which the intent or knowledge of a person hunting migratory birds on a baited field is not an issue. If bait is present, and the hunter is there, he is guilty under the doctrine of strict liability. It is not relevant that the hunter did not know or could not have known bait was present. I question the basic fairness of this rule. 
Mr. President, I do not want anyone to misunderstand me. I strongly support the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We must protect our migratory bird resources from overexploitation. I would not weaken the Act's protections. 
The fundamental goal of the Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act is to address the baiting issue. It is the result of months of negotiation by the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies' Ad Hoc Committee on Baiting. The Committee has representatives from each of the migratory flyways, Ducks Unlimited, the National Wildlife Federation, and the North American Wildlife Enforcement Officers Association. 
Under this legislation, no person may take migratory birds by the aid of bait, or on or over bait, where that person knew or should have known the bait was present. It removes the strict liability interpretation presently followed by federal courts. In its stead, it establishes a standard that permits a determination of the actual guilt of the defendant. If the facts show the hunter knew or should have known of the bait, liability, which includes fines and possible incarceration, would be imposed. However, if the facts show the hunter could not have reasonably known bait was present, the court would not impose liability or assess penalties. This is a question of fact determined by the court based on the evidence presented. 
This legislation would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to publish, in the Federal Register, a notice for public comment defining what is a normal agricultural operation for that geographic area. The Service would make this determination after consultation with state and federal agencies and an opportunity for public comment. The purpose of this provision is to provide guidance for landowners, farmers, wildlife managers, law enforcement officials, and hunters so they know what a normal agricultural operation is for their region. 
The goal of the Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act is to provide guidance to landowners, farmers, wildlife managers, hunters, law enforcement officials, and the courts on the restrictions on the taking of migratory birds. It accomplishes that without weakening the intent of current restrictions on the method and manner of taking migratory birds; nor do the proposed provisions weaken protection of the resource.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of S. 1216, legislation to implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement. S. 1216 was favorably reported out of both the Senate Finance and Commerce Committees. 
The issue of unfair foreign shipbuilding practices is very important to my State. Louisiana is one of the premier shipbuilding states in the country. Over 27,000 Louisiana jobs are impacted by constructing or repairing ships. We have almost every conceivable type and size shipyard, from a huge primarily defense oriented yard to smaller and medium sized strictly commercial yards. My interest in this issue spans the entire range of shipbuilding. 
I believe it's important to state again for the record the historical context that surrounds the OECD Shipbuilding agreement and this implementing legislation. If nothing else, we should learn from history. 1974-1987, saw worldwide overall demand for ocean going vessels decline 71%. United States merchant vessel construction went from an average of 72 ships/year in the 1970's to an average of 21 ships/year in the 1980's. During this period, governments in all the shipbuilding nations, with the exception of the United States, dramatically stepped up aid to their shipyards with massive levels of subsidies in virtually every form. 
In 1981, the U.S. government unilaterally terminated commercial construction subsidies to U.S. yards. At the same time, U.S. defense shipbuilding increased in an effort to reach a 600 ship Navy. U.S. defense shipbuilding construction went from an average of 79 ships/year in the 1970's to an average of 95 ships/year in the 1980's. U.S. international commercial shipbuilding, on the other hand, was virtually abandoned to subsidized foreign yards. 
The end of the 1980's and the end of the `Cold War' saw a Department of Defense reevaluation of the need for a 600 ship Navy. The U.S. shipbuilding industry was consequently forced to reevaluate its need to secure commercial ship construction orders in order to stay in business. In June of 1989, the U.S. shipbuilding industry, represented at that time by the `Shipbuilders Council of America', filed a section 301 claim against the major shipbuilding countries of the world for unfair subsidies and practices that were injuring the U.S. industry. 
Later that year, however, U.S. Trade Ambassador Carla Hills, convinced the industry that a better, more effective way to eliminate the unfair foreign subsidies and practices was through multilateral negotiations. The industry decided to give international negotiations a chance and therefore withdrew its Section 301 claim. The U.S. then encouraged the responsible trading partners to enter into negotiations and the five year OECD quest to negotiate the elimination of trade distorting shipbuilding practices had begun. 
From late 1989 to late 1994, the OECD negotiations were on and off again. During 1993, when the talks had seemingly collapsed, I introduced a bill in the Senate (S. 990) and then Congressman Sam Gibbons introduced a bill in the House (H.R. 1402), that would have unilaterally triggered significant sanctions against ships constructed in foreign subsidized yards when those ships called upon the United States. Despite prompting a flood of domestic opposition from those fearing the bills would start a trade war, the introduction of these bills did help re-ignite the stalled OECD talks. 
From June 1989 until the present agreement was signed on December 21, 1994, the U.S. objective and the U.S. industry's urgent request appeared to be simple: `Eliminate subsidies and we can compete.' When the Clinton administration came into office, to its credit, it proposed a `Shipyard Revitalization Plan.' A main feature of this plan was new Title XI financing for commercial export orders.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the conclusion of the 1998 football season will mark the end of the most extraordinary and successful coaching career in college football history. Eddie Robinson of Grambling State University, in my home State of Louisiana, will retire as that school's head coach after 56 amazing years in that position. Coach Robinson enters retirement at the pinnacle of his profession, holding the record as the most successful college football coach in history with an impressive 408 victories and only 162 losses to his credit. 
Fifty-six years ago, when Coach Robinson came to what was then Louisiana Negro Normal, the school's formative football program rested entirely on his shoulders. Unlike college coaches of today, who are often awarded large contracts and lucrative television deals, Coach Robinson had to build his program from the ground up--literally. During prep basketball games, the new coach sold hamburgers so that he could afford to rent a bulldozer that could clear a field on which his team could practice and play. Once, he persuaded the members of his team to pick cotton so that a farmer's son, who happened to be the school's top running back, could join the team. 
In subsequent years, Coach Robinson built Grambling football into one of the most successful and well-known football programs in the Nation. Today, Coach Robinson and his Grambling Tigers are household names across the country. Throughout the National Football League, the team that Eddie built is known as one the best proving grounds for the NFL stars of the future. More than 300 of his players have gone on to careers in professional football. 
In 1971 alone, 43 former Grambling players were in NFL training camps. Four of his players--Willie Brown, Willie Davis, Charlie Joiner, and Buck Buchanan--are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. And another former player, Doug Williams, became the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl. 
Mr. President, these are some of the accomplishments of Coach Robinson's extraordinary career. But they don't tell the whole story of the amazing life of this son of a former sharecropper. That is because it is Coach Robinson's example off the football field that has proved just as inspirational. 
As a devoted husband and father and an exemplary citizen, Eddie Robinson symbolizes what is best about our country. As those of us who know him can attest, he is the very embodiment of the values of integrity, dignity, loyalty, humility, dedication, and excellence that most Americans still wish for their children. In a day and time when heroes are few and far between, I suggest that the young people of America look no further than Grambling State University for a true American hero named Eddie Robinson--a hero not only because of his success on the football field, but because of his winning attitude toward life and the extraordinary content of his character. 
I know that I speak for every Member of this body when I congratulate Coach Robinson for his many outstanding accomplishments on and off the football field. We wish he and his family every success and happiness in this new and exciting phase of their lives.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor along with Senator Grassley, I am pleased to strongly support the SAVER bill, Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement Act of 1997. This measure is a bi-partisan effort on the part of my colleague, Senator Grassley, and I to help ensure that all Americans are adequately prepared for retirement. As the ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging, I have learned that there is a critical need to educate Americans on the need to save for their retirement. Mr. President, only one-half of all American workers have pensions. A mere one-third of Americans have ever tried to calculate how much money they need for retirement. And less than one-fifth of the workforce is confident that they have saved enough to live comfortably after they retire. Having become aware of this, Senator Grassley and I have introduced a piece of legislation that takes the first step in educating the public about the need to plan ahead. 
Mr. President, as my colleague has just told you, our legislation will create an education project to raise public awareness about personal savings. It directs the U.S. Department of Labor to maintain an ongoing program of education and outreach to the public. The program includes public service announcements, public meetings and the distribution of educational materials. It sets up an Internet site dedicated to promoting individual retirement savings. Americans will be able to log on to the site and complete a worksheet to calculate how much they need to save to adequately supplement their projected Social Security benefits when they retire. 
The SAVER bill also directs the Department of Labor to provide information to small businesses on how they can set up pension programs for their employees. The proposed information includes a plain English description of the common types of retirement savings arrangements available to individuals and employers; a way to calculate estimated retirement savings; and an explanation of how to establish different savings arrangements for workers. 
Finally, SAVER calls for a national summit on retirement savings to bring the urgency of our Nation's extremely low saving rate to the top of the public agenda. The event would serve as a catalyst for future policy discussion on how to best increase personal retirement savings as well as accessibility and participation in pension plans. The summit will represent the kind of public-private cooperation that is so crucial to preserving successful retirement programs for future generations of Americans. The Department of Labor will work closely with the American Savings Education Council [ASEC] to bring together delegates from all over the country to develop a broad-based public education program on retirement savings. As Senator Grassley correctly pointed out, ASEC is an organization uniquely equipped to assist us in our efforts. Their input in both the logistical and conceptual organization of this event will help us create a top-notch program. At the summit, participants will identify barriers that prevent many Americans from setting aside enough money for their retirement and barriers that discourage employers--especially small business--from helping their employees accumulate more savings for their retirement. 
Mr. President, as we move forward with reforming Social Security and Medicare, we must also provide more Americans with the incentives they need to better prepare for their retirement. Our SAVER bill not only gives Americans the tools they need to determine how much personal savings they need to supplement their Social Security benefits, it also raises awareness of the responsibility individuals have for planning for their future. 
Mr. President, I believe that the SAVER bill is the first step that this Congress must take in assisting all Americans in their quest for a comfortable, happy retirement. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this measure.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member, the Senator from New York, for recognizing me. 
I take this time just to say a couple of words about the President's nominee to be the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, Mr. Charles Rossotti, who I enthusiastically support. I think the President has made a good choice. It is interesting to note that this appointment will be the first nontax lawyer to head the Internal Revenue Service since World War II. That might not make a lot of waves in some areas, but I think considering the problems we are experiencing with the Internal Revenue Service that this is a very positive qualification at the current time. 
I say that because I think that many of the problems that we heard in the days of hearings that we had in the Senate Finance Committee about the Internal Revenue Service were not so much tax problems but human problems; not so much a problem about how much money was being collected and where it was being collected from or where it was not being collected from, but really more evidence was given to us about mishandling of individuals, mistreatment of individuals, setting quotas for Internal Revenue Service agents that they had to meet in order to be considered for an appointment; review processes of Internal Revenue Service personnel that were conducted by Internal Revenue Service personnel themselves whose appointments many times were based on how they defended the Internal Revenue Service. 
These are not problems that call for a tax attorney but rather cry out for a person who is experienced in the business world, who is experienced with handling large numbers of employees, who is experienced in the management of a company or in the management of a corporation. These are the type of qualifications that I think are needed at this particular time in the history of the Internal Revenue Service. It is a very large agency with over 100,000 employees, and, of course, there are going to be mistakes made. The question is not whether mistakes are going to be made, but rather how we correct those mistakes. I think Mr. Charles Rossotti brings a particular degree of expertise to this position at this particular time. 
I was interested in some of the answers that he gave when we asked him questions about what he thought needed to be done and how would he approach his job. I think the responses we received were right on target for what is needed at this time. 
He said that he would not tolerate IRS workers who treat taxpayers abusively and would fire such workers as necessary. 
I don't know about my colleagues, but as one Member of the Senate, I feel a sense of apprehension when I deal with the Internal Revenue Service, and I am a Member of the U.S. Senate and sit on the Senate Finance Committee which has jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Service. Yet, I feel a little hesitant when I deal with the agency for fear of doing something wrong. It is like that knock on the door that comes and someone says, `It is the IRS,' and they are here to see you and you go into an absolute panic. That should not be the feeling that Americans have toward an agency that really works for them. They work for the taxpayers of this country, as do we. 
So I was very pleased to see Charles Rossotti say, `I will not tolerate IRS workers who treat taxpayers abusively and would fire such workers, if necessary.' 
He also said that the practice of evaluating an IRS employee performance based on quotas or based on how many cases they make will not be a determining factor in how well they do within the agency. I think that is important. 
I think some of our colleagues have probably had experiences in respective States where State troopers were promoted and evaluated based on how many tickets they wrote. It was a quota system. They had to issue so many tickets in 1 day or they were going to be looked upon as not doing their job properly. That is something that I think is a mistake. 
Mr. Charles Rossotti has indicated that that will not be the basis for evaluating and determining performances by IRS agents. I think that is a step in the right direction. They should not be judged just on how much money they bring in. They should be judged on a whole series of factors on how they perform on their jobs, not the least of which is how they treat the people they work for--the taxpayers of this country. 
He outlined three principles. These are not tax principles. These are personnel principles, management principles, and that is why I think he is the right man for the job at this time. 
In talking about management responsibility, he said he would expect managers to keep on top of activities under their authority and quickly halt abuses. These managers will be responsible for the abuses that may or may not occur within their jurisdiction. 
He said that he was going to be strongly supportive of open communication. He wants to create an atmosphere in which workers are willing to bring problems to the attention of the managers without fear of reprisal. That is a personnel decision. We had people from the agency testifying before our committee behind a screen to separate them from the other IRS personnel for fear of retribution because of their testimony. 
They actually said they were fearful to tell anybody about the problems that they saw for fear of being retaliated against or demoted or never promoted because of their willingness to come up and say, `Look, there's something wrong in my section. I don't think we're dealing right with the people that we work for.' So I was very pleased to see that the nominee addressed the question of open communication. 
And then, finally, on the performance measurements--and I mentioned this--he said, there will be no revenue quotas or perceptions of quotas in worker evaluation. Instead, he said he wants to create a set of measurements that do in fact measure what we want, including taxpayer satisfaction with their dealings with the agency. 
I think that that goes a long way. If an agent is of the opinion that he is going to be judged on his performance based on how much money he brings in, there is a certain degree of pressure to go out and do as much as he or she possibly can. That should not be the guiding principles of the Internal Revenue Service agents when they deal with the American public. 
The final point I make is that I think most of us would agree that the American taxpayer should feel there is someone within this department that is on their side. They know that the 104,000 Internal Revenue Service agents have a job, that their job is to collect the legitimate revenues that are owed by taxpayers so that their country could be a better place, a safer place in which to live. They understand that. 
But right now they feel that in dealing with this agency of Government, there is no one on their side, that they are against a bureaucracy and that they are really helpless, particularly when they understand that they have to somehow prove themselves innocent if they are ever accused by the Internal Revenue Service. I think that is wrong. 
I mean, every courthouse in America that I have ever been in, when someone is accused of doing something wrong, the person who is bringing that accusation, whether it be a State's attorney, the district attorney, or what have you, has an obligation to make the case beyond a reasonable doubt and with a preponderance of the evidence in civil cases and beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases. The person making the accusation has to prove it to various standards according to the court that they happen to be operating in--except here, where the Government can bring down the full bureaucracy of the American Government on an individual taxpayer, and somehow that individual has to come in and say, `Let me attempt to prove my innocence,' instead of having the Government prove that something was done incorrectly, improper, or illegally in order to justify a penalty against the American taxpayer. I think that is incorrect. I think that that should be changed. 
The other point that I think is important to note right now is that we have legislation--I have introduced it with a number of cosponsors; it has been incorporated into the Senators Kerrey and Grassley proposal--which creates this commission, which creates what I will call a Taxpayer Protection Office where when the taxpayer has a problem with the agency, that he or she knows there is some place where he or she can go, either by walking into a district office or using a 1-800 telephone number to explain their side of the dispute and have someone in the agency take the time to learn their side of the issue, so that they can have someone to represent them and their position before their own Government. I think that is important. 
We have a type of office like that now called the Taxpayer's Advocate, but it really is run by IRS agents. They are only going to be there a short time. Then they will be promoted or demoted, depending on their performance, to some other part of the department at a later date. So those people are just moving through the system. 
Our legislation says that these people shall not directly be IRS employees, but should be more an organization that looks after the interests of the taxpayer and would be subject to the 
Commissioner himself's jurisdiction. I think that should go a long way to helping the American taxpayer know that within this bureaucracy there is some department, some division, someone who is actually going to be on their side and help them represent their case to the Internal Revenue Service itself. 
So I think that is where we are today, and the question before the Senate is, should the Senate confirm this nominee? I enthusiastically lend my support to the nomination. We had an excellent hearing with him. I think what he said was right on target. The fact that he is not a tax lawyer is probably part of his qualifications for this particular title. I support the nomination. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, in light of the disturbing news in the stock market this afternoon, I thought it was appropriate to the bring to the attention of my colleagues that there is good news out there. The United States and Japan have concluded a trade agreement opening up the ports of Japan, ending a longstanding dispute between the United States and Japan. This agreement, when it is signed--and it is agreed to--will bring about changes that will benefit ocean-borne trade of both countries, the United States and Japan. The agreements will reform practices in the Japanese ports, to the benefit of importers, exporters, the ports, the workers, and the consumers both in the United States and Japan. 
This is good for trade relations between our two countries. The Japanese had for a long period of time prevented our ships from having the same rights to their ports, in terms of bringing our goods to that country, as we have afforded them when they came calling on ports in the United States. Therefore, this is good news for people who are engaged in trade relations and exports and import trade relations with Japan and the United States. 
I am very optimistic that this will bring about continued growth in those markets, and I want to commend the Federal Maritime Commission, its Chairman, Hal Creel, and members of the administration, particularly Stu Eizenstat, for the good work they have done in bringing this to a conclusion. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the regular order.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will just use this time to make a comment about a resolution that is soon to be introduced in a bipartisan fashion, dealing with trade practices between our country and the country of Japan. As many may have recognized recently in the news, we have been involved in a very long and very serious dispute with the country of Japan regarding access, opening up their ports to our industries the same way that our American ports are open to Japanese ships when they call on United States ports here in this country. This dispute has been going on for a number of years. It has gotten to be very, very serious. 
We will soon be introducing a resolution. We have talked to Chairman Helms and Majority Leader Lott and our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle. I know Senator Hollings is very interested in this as well. We worked on a resolution, which will be introduced, which will commend the administration and also the Federal Maritime Commission for their efforts to date in bringing this 15-year problem with the Japanese port practices to a successful conclusion. Since the press and many of my colleagues have already adequately described the history of the Japanese port practices, I am not going to repeat it here. But I would like to make a few comments on what has happened. 
First, I think it is very important from this Senator's perspective to recognize that we have been able to work for a successful and satisfactory conclusion of this problem because of the strong, independent action that the Federal Maritime Commission was able to take. As an independent agency, the Federal Maritime Commission has the flexibility to carry out policies that are good for America without having to go through a number of steps and consultations with agencies within our Government that sometimes actually impede the process of quickly and appropriately making decisions that must be made. Because of its independent status, it was able to take this action in a way that should bring about what I think will be a satisfactory conclusion. 
The second point I would like to make is I think it is appropriate at this time to recognize the decision of our U.S. Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, last year, to refuse to commit the United States to an inadequate GATS maritime agreement. Had the United States accepted that proposal last year, which was a so-called standstill proposal, these same Japanese port barriers would have been grandfathered in and would have been recognized as the international law of the land. The Federal Maritime Commission, including the rest of the U.S. Government, would have then been powerless to do anything about them except to try to negotiate them away during subsequent rounds of talks with the WTO starting in the year 2000. No agreement is better than a bad agreement. This is a clear example that what the U.S. Trade Representative did at that time was appropriate and proper. 
Finally, I believe any agreement on the port practices dispute involving the United States and the country of Japan must include two fundamental points: First, a collection of fines to the extent it shows other countries around the world, not only Japan, that the United States is very serious about reciprocal market access and compliance with our laws; and, second, a vigilant, continued monitoring and enforcement by the Federal Maritime Commission of the changes in port practices promised by the Government of Japan. Both of these two elements are absolutely essential for any type of credible agreement. The Federal Maritime Chairman, Hal Creel, the Federal Maritime Commissioners, Ming Hsu, Del Won, Joe Scroggins and their staffs are to be commended for their extraordinary efforts to resolve this matter in a firm and fair manner. Likewise, I commend our State Department Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Stu Eisenstadt and his staff. They are to be commended for their perseverance in this matter. 
Now is not the time, however, for congratulations. We are not quite there yet. Negotiations are continuing. But with additional fortitude, consumers and carriers and their customers, both in Japan and the United States, will soon enjoy the fruits of our labors. We have come too far to settle for any type of mediocre agreement. We cannot and should not give up now. I think a solid resolution of this issue is feasible and I expect one to be concluded in a reasonable amount of time. 
Mr. President, if no one else is seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I'm pleased to cosponsor with Senator Bond the mitigation banking amendment to the highway bill. I thank Senator Bond for his leadership and am pleased to continue working with him on wetlands-related issues. 
The Bond-Breaux amendment is direct and straightforward. It simply says that mitigation banking shall be the preferred means, to the maximum extent practicable, to mitigate for wetlands or natural habitat which are affected as part of a Federal-aid highway project and whose mitigation is paid for with Federal-aid funds. 
In addition, the amendment identifies three factors that are to be met in order to use a mitigation bank: first, the affected wetlands or natural habitat are to be in a bank's service area; second, the bank has to have enough credits available to offset the impact; and third, the bank has to meet federally approved standards. 
So, Senator Bond and I, through this amendment, are simply trying to establish a reasonable, responsible wetlands and natural habitat mitigation policy as part of the Federal-aid highway program. 
Our proposal has two key components: First, we say give mitigation banking a preference, to the maximum extent practicable, which is reasonable. Second, we say a bank should meet certain conditions to ensure its effectiveness and viability, which is being responsible. 
Let me emphasize that our amendment does not mandate the use of mitigation banks. Nor does the amendment require their use nor does it say they shall be the sole means or the only method used to mitigate affected wetlands or natural habitat. 
The Bond-Breaux amendment simply says mitigation banks shall be the preferred means, to the maximum extent practicable, and they must meet certain responsible conditions before they can be used. 
Louisiana's transportation department officials have said that the State already uses mitigation banks and areas as an option for some of its highway projects. 
Mitigation banks can offer several advantages when constructed and operated responsibly. They can achieve economies of scale. They can provide larger, higher quality and diverse habitat and they can make mitigation costs less expensive when compared to costs for some isolated mitigation sites which are not part of a bank. 
The Bond-Breaux amendment certainly is in line with the environmental provisions and direction of the proposed highway bill we have before the Senate, S. 1173. 
For these reasons, I urge the Senate's adoption of the amendment when it comes up for consideration. 
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this afternoon, I rise to introduce legislation representing, I think, a very important step in giving American taxpayers an additional tool for them to use in solving problems that they have when they are entering into a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. My bill would ensure that American taxpayers have someone with real authority and significant resources who will represent their interests when dealing with IRS, a true taxpayer advocacy organization which will be on the side of the American taxpayer and not on the side of Washington bureaucrats. 
I want to also point out that I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Kerrey-Grassley bill, which is a broader restructuring of the entire Internal Revenue Service, that came about as part of the work that the bipartisan commission studied for over a year's time. 
The bill, however, that I am introducing today will strengthen the part of the bill dealing with the Office of Taxpayer Advocate by making the advocate's office much more independent than it is now and giving it more muscle in representing the interests of American taxpayers. 
Last month, our Senate Finance Committee had 3 days of hearings looking at the practices and procedures within the Internal Revenue Service. In addition to hearing from taxpayers who had been mistreated by the Internal Revenue Service, our committee also heard very shocking testimony from both current and former IRS employees. These witnesses clearly underscored the importance of doing some major changes in how the Internal Revenue Service operates. 
We heard, for instance, Acting Commissioner of IRS Mike Nolan say, `The IRS is undergoing tremendous change.' 
That is very encouraging and also very long overdue. My concern is that there is a big disconnect between the Commissioner's office and over 100,000 IRS employees who work all over America, and even a greater disconnect between some of these employees--not all, but some--and the American taxpayer. This became very painfully clear as a result of our 3 days of hearings. 
I want to point out that the IRS is a very convenient political punching bag for many, and speeches condemning the IRS are met with widespread applause at any type of a townhall meeting you want to have. But this is not an issue that we should demagog. Americans want us to solve the problem and not just pass the blame around and blame the other side for their failures. 
As was the case with the balanced budget amendment, Republicans and Democrats need to come together in a bipartisan fashion and act responsibly to come up with some real changes that are going to help address this problem and protect the American taxpayer. 
Unless we don't want a national defense or a public highway system or schools and national parks, we have to ask ourselves, what will we have if we just eliminated the Internal Revenue Service? When the Department of Defense, I am reminded, had all of these problems buying $200 toilet seats and $500 hammers, we didn't do away with the Department of Defense, we reformed it. We gave them specific instructions on how they should conduct their business. As a result, we still have a Department of Defense, thank goodness, but it is operating more efficiently and more effectively and not making the type of mistakes that we saw in the past. The bottom line is we reformed it. We have to do the same thing with the Internal Revenue Service. 
There are many issues to look at when we talk about how to restructure. One is IRS management, how to model a new oversight structure at the IRS that would make it more responsive and accountable to their management problems. 
There also is a separate issue, and that is how to strengthen the hand of the American taxpayer when they have to deal with the Internal Revenue Service and let our American taxpayers know that somewhere there is someone who is on their side when they have problems with the Federal Government and specifically with the IRS. 
On the first issue of management, attention has focused on who should sit on the board of directors that runs an IRS and what kind of authority and responsibilities this board would have. I think there is widespread agreement that the management and oversight of the IRS needs to improve dramatically. We need to have more private sector involvement in that board of directors. 
The Finance Committee is going to have hearings on the restructuring question next week. I hope that we have a fair and open discussion about what needs to be done, because that is the only way a solution will be arrived at. I personally think we should try and model the management of IRS on a real board of directors, a concept that is part of the bill introduced by Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley and also Congressmen Portman and Cardin in the House of Representatives. I am a cosponsor of their legislation and will be actively participating in getting that done. 
There is no reason why the Internal Revenue Service shouldn't be just as advanced technologically from an organizational standpoint as any Fortune 500 company in America. Our goal should be to have an oversight board that improves the IRS accountability and also their operations. A better managed IRS will translate into better customer service for taxpayers. 
But just as important, however, we need to look at ways to improve the everyday outcomes when taxpayers have a problem and have to engage with the IRS. An oversight board may solve some of those, but we need to put in place some independent group that is going to represent the interests of the American taxpayer on a day-to-day basis, and that is what my legislation would do. 
Currently, the IRS has an Office of Taxpayer Advocate whose job is to represent the American taxpayers in dealings with the IRS. The problem with the current structure, however, is that this taxpayer advocate does not have enough independence. The taxpayer advocate in each district reports directly to the district director of the IRS. Taxpayers need someone who will work for them and represent their interests and not just be an employee of the IRS. 
My bill would make the taxpayer advocate a great deal more independent by giving it more resources, more authority and more responsibilities. The American taxpayers would then have someone working for them and not just working for the IRS when they need help. 
My bill would do the following: 
No. 1: A national taxpayer advocate would be appointed directly by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. He or she would not continue to be appointed by the IRS Commissioner. The national taxpayer advocate would also not be selected from the ranks of the IRS, to make sure that person is truly independent. 
No. 2: The national taxpayer advocate will make the hiring and firing decisions regarding the heads of the local taxpayer advocate office in the IRS district and service centers. No longer would the local taxpayer advocate be hired and fired by the district director. 
No. 3: The initial contact between the IRS and the taxpayer will include a disclosure that the taxpayers have a right to contact their local taxpayer advocate and information on how to contact them so that the taxpayer will know that this office is there and it is there to protect their legitimate interests. 
No. 4: The local taxpayer advocate office would have a separate phone number, fax number, and post office box apart from the IRS district office. 
And finally, No. 5: The taxpayer advocate would also have the discretion not to disclose taxpayer information to IRS employees, another tool which could help taxpayers. 
All of these measures are designed to give the taxpayer advocate a much stronger voice, a much stronger hand in representing American taxpayers. What taxpayers in this country need is someone who is on their side, not on the Government side, who has the resources to go up against the IRS. 
I have been working closely with Senator Kerrey and pleased he supports including my provision in the overall bill that they are planning to introduce. So, I think we are making progress. I think we ought to be doing it in a continued responsible fashion, in a bipartisan fashion. If we can get this done, I just suggest that the American taxpayer will now know that there is some office that is on their side representing their interests before their Government.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my colleague, Senator D'Amato, an important bill that will assist States and localities in working with private industry to foster economic development and provide home ownership opportunities to low-income Americans. Specifically, our bill will increase the private activity tax-exempt bond cap to $75 per capita or $250 million, if greater, and index the cap to inflation. Congress created the private activity-exempt bond decades ago to apply to mortgage revenue bonds and other bonds for multifamily housing, redevelopment of blighted areas, student loans, manufacturing, and hazardous waste disposal facilities. However, Congress unintentionally restricted the growth of this program by imposing a cap on the bond volume of $50 per capita or $150 million, if greater, which has meant States cannot meet the demand for these bonds. 
Tax-exempt bonds are issued by State and local governments to provide below market interest rates to fund authorized programs and projects. Revenue bond investors accept lower interest from these bonds because the interest income is tax-exempt. Mortgage revenue bonds are issued to help lower income working families buy their first homes with low interest loans from private investment in State and local bonds, significantly lowering the cost of owning a home. 
In my own State, the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency has issued over $1.1 billion in mortgage revenue bonds for almost 16,000 affordable home mortgages since the program began. In 1996 alone, the agency issued over $112 million in mortgage revenue bonds for nearly 1,200 home loans. That's 1,200 Louisiana families who now know the pride of owning their own home--Louisiana families that earned, on average, less than $28,000 last year. The Louisiana Housing Finance Agency estimates that it alone could have used another $50 million in bond authority. Nationwide, States could have used an additional $7 billion in bond cap for mortgage revenue bonds, student loan bonds, industrial revenue bonds, pollution control bonds, and other worthy investments. 
Student loan bonds are issued to raise a pool of money at tax-exempt interest rates to fund college loans at lesser interest rates. In my State, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority has issued $745 million in student loan bonds since 1984. These bonds have funded over 80,000 college loans for deserving Louisiana students--students who otherwise might not have been able to afford to attend college. 
In Louisiana, the roughly $40 million of remaining 1997 volume cap will not come close to fulfilling the $330 million of demand for these bonds. The total 1997 volume cap for Louisiana was $217,500,000. After funding minimal housing and student loan needs, little volume cap remains available for industrial development bonds for manufacturing purposes. Many of the industrial and manufacturing facilities create substantial employment opportunities that are not possible due in part to a deficiency in volume cap. 
Our bill will correct this woeful situation and improve the ability of States and localities to provide home ownership opportunities to low-income families throughout the United States, to help fund student loans for college students and to help finance industrial and manufacturing facilities. These facilities will, in turn, increase employment and the tax base of local governments. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator D'Amato in this effort.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, the American Fisheries Act, S. 1221, was introduced last week by Senators Stevens, Murkowski, Hollings and myself. This bill represents another major milestone in our long efforts to reserve U.S. fishery resources for bona fide U.S. citizens as well as take steps to substantially improve the conservation and management of our Nation's fishery resources through a reduction in the overcapitalization of our fishing fleets. To put the bill in perspective, I wish to remind my colleagues of the steps taken in the past to establish our fishery conservation zone now called the Exclusive Economic Zone or EEZ, to support an American preference for harvesting and processing fishery resources within that zone, to eliminate foreign fishing in our EEZ whenever sufficient U.S. capacity existed, and finally to reduce the conservation and management problems associated with excess capacity. The historical basis for such a bill is well established in U.S. fishery policy.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, November 8th will be a significant and emotional day for the more than 13,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard. That day will mark the conclusion of the extraordinary and distinguished military career of their beloved adjutant general, Maj. Gen. Ansel `Buddy' Stroud. 
For 17 years, `Buddy' Stroud has provided strong and innovative leadership as Louisiana's top guardsman. In fact, anyone familiar with the Louisiana National Guard can attest that today's Louisiana National Guard is better trained, better equipped, and better prepared to defend our Nation than ever before. And much of that high degree of training and preparedness is due to the visionary and determined leadership that General Stroud has always provided. 
Under General Stroud's able command, the Louisiana National Guard has always enjoyed widespread popular support in my State and has often made the difference in times of crisis and natural disaster in our State. In 1992, when Hurricane Andrew pounded the South Louisiana coast and inflicted heavy damage on a number of communities from New Orleans to Lafayette, General Stroud and his men were on the scene almost immediately. I suspect that without his leadership--and without the dedicated, hardworking guardsmen under his command--Louisiana's recovery from Andrew would have been much more painful and prolonged. 
The Louisiana military personnel under General Stroud's command also distinguished themselves in another endeavor. During 1990-91, more than 6,400 men and women were activated for duty in Desert Shield/Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf. In all, 2,000 Louisiana Guardsmen saw duty in the Persian Gulf war. Our Nation and the people of Kuwait owe these men and women--and thousands of other guardsmen from other states--our sincere gratitude for their service in this noble cause. 
Earlier this year, when the rapidly rising Mississippi River threatened to overwhelm our State penitentiary at Angola, General Stroud's guardsmen helped save the day by shoring up the levees. Because of the Guard's immediate response to this potential disaster, a costly evacuation of thousands of prisoners was averted. 
Under General Stroud's leadership, the Guard has not only been present in times of natural disaster. Buddy Stroud has given thousands of Louisiana high school dropouts a second chance by creating a bootcamp-style program that instills discipline and guides these former dropouts toward the achievement of their high school diploma. Another program created under General Stroud's leadership, the Louisiana National Guard's Youth Challenge Program, was recently honored as the best overall youth challenge program in the United States. 
Buddy Stroud was born on April 5, 1927 in Shreveport, LA. After his high school graduation, he attended college at Baylor and Texas A&M and graduated with his B.S. degree 
from the University of the State of New York. His long and distinguished military career began with his enlistment in the Army in 1944. Three years later, in 1947, he began a half century of service in the Louisiana National Guard, which culminated in 1981 with his promotion to the rank of major general. 
General Stroud served his Nation in a number of other capacities. He is former president of the National Guard Association of the United States and has served on that organization's executive council for the last 4 years. He has also served as president of the Adjutants General Association of the United States. 
Among General Stroud's professional achievements is a 1977 study which he directed for the Department of the Army on full-time training and administration for the Army Guard and the Army Reserve. The study, known as the Stroud Study, was accepted by the Army as a guideline for requirements of the National Guard and Army Reserve for full-time manning programs and was the basis for launching the AGR program. Most recently, General Stroud's unique contributions were recognized by the people of Louisiana when the State legislature directed that the Louisiana Military History and Weapons Museum should now bear his name. 
While he will no longer serve the Guard in a full-time capacity, I know that retirement will not diminish `Buddy' Stroud's dedication to the Louisiana National Guard. In fact, I am certain that, even in retirement, he will find a way to continue making a significant contribution. 
For many years, it has been my honor and privilege count `Buddy' Stroud as a friend. I could begin to count the number of times we worked together on behalf of the Louisiana National Guard, and because of our joint endeavors, I will always have fond memories of the important work that we did--together--for the Louisiana National Guard and the people of Louisiana. Most of all, however, I will always value Buddy's friendship. 
Mr. President, Buddy Stroud is a truly extraordinary American. I know I speak for all Louisianians and all Americans when I salute him for his more than half century of distinguished service to his country and his State and wish him only the best in his well-deserved retirement.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as one of the original authors of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, I can advise the Senate that we spent a great deal of time and effort in developing a law that would result in the information, data, and interpretation remaining confidential. Any steps that would put that confidentiality at risk are contrary to the spirit and intent of what we were trying to accomplish in 1972. 
At that time, geophysical contractors were particularly concerned about the data sharing and confidentiality provisions of the OCSLA because they felt any breach of that confidentiality would destroy the market for the data, which is the geophysical contractors' sole asset. To protect that confidentiality, provisions were adopted requiring MMS to make sure the agency obtained permission from the permittee and anyone to whom the permittee sold the data under promise of confidentiality before sharing any data obtained from the permittee with a State government. 
Shortly after the amendment of the OCSLA, MMS promulgated regulations spelling out the mechanics of how data was to be made available to it and how it was to be protected once it had been turned over. Among those rules is one that mandates that the permittee, who had agreed to make its geophysical data available to MMS as a condition of the permit, require any party to whom the data is transferred to agree to the terms of the permit regarding data sharing as a condition of the transfer. Industry contends that when that regulation was proposed, MMS proposed to define the term `transfer' in a way that included nonexclusive licensees, but dropped that requirement from the final rule. Industry believes that MMS has now proposed to extend its data sharing requirements to nonexclusive licensees and to amend its regulations in several other significant ways. 
MMS contends that, in the 25-year span of its statutory responsibility to hold geophysical data confidential, this confidentiality has never been breached. And, MMS believes its current rulemaking is fully consistent with its authority under the OCSLA. In other words, MMS is going forward with its rulemaking without further public input.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the tenor of these proceedings. MMS is the Federal agency charged with the responsibility to manage the mineral resources of the Outer Continental Shelf in an environmentally sound and safe manner and to timely collect, verify, and distribute mineral revenues from Federal and Indian lands. So, I want to know that this proposal is the best way to get at the objective that underlies it--a fair and reliable royalty system. But, I also want to ensure that the individuals and businesses affected by the MMS proposal are accorded every opportunity to have their concerns heard. 
I agree that MMS needs access to G&G information to discharge its important duties. But, it ought to accomplish that duty in a way that does not risk disrupting one of the Federal Government's most successful revenue programs. The G&G industry estimates that the proposed regulations will, if adopted, require the renegotiation of thousands of existing license agreements and, until that renegotiation is complete, no data can be licensed. This renegotiation process may take several months, if not years. During that time, there will be no exploration. Thus, the process that recently led to another record oil and gas lease sale on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf, providing needed revenue to the Federal Treasury, will come to a grinding halt. This is an interruption we cannot afford. 
For 50 years, oil and natural gas have been produced from the Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] underlying the Gulf of Mexico. This production represents more than 83 percent of total OCS oil production and more than 99 percent of all OCS natural gas production. In 1995, production from this area accounted for 15 percent of all oil produced in the United States and about a quarter of the natural gas. 
Maintaining public trust in our royalty system is critical to the future of oil and gas leasing, both onshore and offshore. Federal royalty policy must balance the need to encourage public resource development with the need to ensure that the public gets its fair royalty share. That balancing act requires government and industry to work together. The OCS leasing program is one example of government and the private sector working together--reflected by the recent record leases, records bonus payments and increased exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. 
I hope we can advance that partnership here. Let's take another opportunity to learn from each other what is working, what is not working under the current system--and how the MMS proposal addresses those problems. Then, we can move forward with a balanced policy that assures timely and accurate royalty payments for the people of the United States.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Sean P. Allerton, a member of the Boy Scouts of America's Troop 189 in New Orleans, LA. In 1992, the 102d Congress amended the Constitution of the United States of America by ratifying the 27th amendment. In doing so, thousands of Government textbooks and educational tools throughout the country became outdated. American government students around the world were retrieving information in libraries, in classrooms and in textbooks that reported the Constitution as only having 26 amendments. 
Sean Allerton recognized this lack of current information, and as his Eagle Scout project, decided to rectify the problem. He called upon numerous organizations and individuals in the New Orleans area to sponsor his goal of getting 6,600 copies of the new Constitution distributed to every American government and civics student in New Orleans. On August 21 of this year, he received a letter and a check from State District Court Judge Lloyd J. Medley, Jr., who believed in the importance of Sean's project and donated the financial backing to carry it forth. 
On September 17, mayor of New Orleans Marc Morial will hold a press conference to congratulate and thank Sean on his endeavor, and to distribute the new copies of the Constitution to the students of New Orleans. I, too, would like to send words of support and thanks from the 105th Congress to Sean P. Allerton, for reminding us of the value of service and the patriotism that strengthens this country's heart. Thank you, Sean.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, my colleagues, it has been interesting to hear all of the various Members of the Senate come to this floor and talk about the product that is before us. We have had a few people who have expressed concerns to the extent that they cannot support the agreement that is now before the Senate. I think that is unfortunate. 
I remember, when I first came to the House of Representatives, I read a book that was written by Lawrence O'Brien, who had been in the service of both President Kennedy and President Johnson as the head of congressional relations. The title of that book was `No Final Victories.' The gist of the story that he was trying to convey was simply that in this business of governing, in this business of politics, there are never really any final victories. There are a whole series of small steps that are taken, small accomplishments and small achievements that are reached. But there is really never any final victory because the job is really and truly never done. 
When I look at the package of spending cuts and the package of tax reductions that we have before the Senate this week, I am really reminded of that whole theme and thesis of Lawrence O'Brien in `No Final Victories.' Because if you ask a question, Is this a perfect package? the answer, obviously, is no. If you ask the question, Should we have done more? the answer is obviously yes. If you ask the question, Are you disappointed and discouraged that things that you worked on are not in this package? I would say, absolutely. Discouraged and disappointed in some areas, yes. But defeated, no. Because I think on balance these agreements that are now before the Senate are major achievements. They are major steps in the right direction. The work is not yet finished. There is a great deal more that needs to be done. But we have, I think, set this country on a course and moving in a direction which is the correct one for all of us. 
One of the things that I am so encouraged by is the fact that we were able to do it in a bipartisan fashion. The vote in the Senate of 80 to 18 and the vote in the Senate of 72 to 27, I think, on spending cuts and tax reductions is in fact a major accomplishment. These problems are too difficult and too serious for one party to be able to do by themselves. The only way we are ever going to be able to reach these agreements that put us on the path of really reforming the Government is to do it together. I think that where we worked best was when we worked with both sides trying to meet in the center and trying to cooperate in a fashion that could really bring true reform to this institution. 
The disappointment that I see in the bill is that we missed, for one, an opportunity to really reform Medicare. I think that what we essentially did was to follow what I call the SOS premise --same old, same old. We essentially looked at Medicare and said, `Well, we have a lot of problems with it and we all know it is going to go bankrupt and insolvent at the end of the year 2001. So let's appoint a commission to try to recommend to Congress what we already know needs to be done.' 
I stand here with a great degree of pride and am so pleased that our colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, is on the floor with us today because some of the things that we all know need to be done we already did when we worked together in the Centrist Coalition in the last Congress and recommended some real strong, difficult things that needed to be done with regard to the Medicare Program--which was offered by our group, a bipartisan group equally divided in the last Congress, when we took on the tough recommendation of means testing for wealthier seniors to help contribute more to ensure that the program is going to be there for their children, for their grandchildren, and for their great grandchildren. 
We needed to recognize that people live longer. So we took the position of recommending a gradual increase, I might add over the next 30 years, in the eligibility age for Medicare recipients merely reflecting the increase in life expectancy of all of our citizens, which is a very good thing to do. We also made tough recommendations, I think, in trying to bring about more competition in the Medicare System. But basically those ideas and those concepts, which got 46 votes on the U.S. Senate floor in the last Congress, were dumped in the conference, 
dumped not really on the merits but because we needed more political cover. 
What is the political cover that we have decided upon? Well, it is `same old, same old,' let us appoint a commission. I would love to serve on the commission, quite frankly. I would love to try to make the recommendations that are needed for us to be able to take the action that is necessary. Unfortunately, while the commission will prepare a report by March 1999, Congress does not have to act on any of their recommendations. We can just say: Thank you. It's been a wonderful opportunity to hear what you have to say, but we don't have to do anything about it. 
I think my colleague from Nebraska said: Wait a minute; we already had a commission. I served as a cochair of it. We have already made these recommendations. Why do we need another commission? Why do we need a commission at all? Why doesn't Congress act as a commission? 
You know what. Maybe the answer is that we can designate ourselves a commission, and instead of calling ourselves the U.S. Senate, we will call ourselves the U.S. Commission and then we can make the same recommendations that we have already made and act on it and say, well, the commission made the recommendation to get the job done that way. 
But I think we have missed an opportunity, and that is unfortunate. If we can't do it this year, it is going to be difficult to do it in an election year. I am always amazed that everybody tells us to fix it. How many times have we heard seniors and others tell us to fix Medicare. They say fix it but don't increase the premium; fix it but don't increase the age of eligibility. I have said several times before, if not now, when? When are we going to do it? And if not this, what? And if not us, who? Someone has to take the actions to do the things that are difficult and make the tough decisions needed to fix the problem. 
What is going to happen when we wake up on December 31 in the year 2007 and we still haven't acted on the recommendations of the commission and we need to do something to fix a program on the brink of insolvency again? What kind of an answer are we going to come up with in an emergency? It is far better to try to do this at a time when the economy is good and people are working together in a bipartisan spirit. 
So the fact we have another commission which succeeds the last commission which succeeds previous commissions is certainly not an act of courage. It will not make a chapter in the next Profiles in Courage book that is written about what we have done in the Congress, and that is unfortunate. But I say that because we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good in the sense that we will never be for anything unless it is perfect. While this is not a perfect package by any stretch of the imagination, it is a good package. It is one that merits our support. As long as we know that this package, the tax cut and the spending cuts and what we have done in Medicare is not the final answer but just a beginning, I think I would say this to our colleagues who have worked together on this: At least we have paved the road to make it easier for future Congresses to reach tough conclusions and make tough decisions that are really necessary to save Medicare. 
So I support the tax package and commend Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for doing something that has not been done in a long time, maybe since the days of my predecessor, Senator Russell Long, on the committee, when both sides were able to say, all right, we are different parties but we are all Americans and we need to ultimately work together if anything is going to be done. 
I always take the position that in politics it is better to get something done and then fight over who got it done, rather than to get nothing done and then blame the other side for failure. I am glad that the Finance Committee was truly able to work together and get something done in a bipartisan way. Now we can go fight about who got it done. But at least we got something done for the American people. We did that in this Congress. We did that with these bills. We made tough decisions both in taxes and in 
spending. I hope that one day in the not too distant future the rest of the Congress will be able to act in an equally bipartisan fashion and get the rest of the job done. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator and start by congratulating her on the effort she has made in this regard, and Senator Stevens from Alaska for the work he has done along with Senator Kerry, and also acknowledge Senator Barbara Boxer's longstanding commitment on doing what is necessary to preserve and protect dolphins. 
As we bring this legislation to the floor, it is very, very significant, for we have been working on this for 25 years to try to improve on a program that I think has made great progress in preserving the ability for the tuna industry in the United States, one of the most popular fishing resources in the entire world, to be able to continue to operate in a manner that does not cause death or mortality or serious harm to dolphin, which conflict, many times, with the tuna fish themselves. This industry, I think, is to be commended because they have made tremendous strides in trying to preserve their industry, at the same time protecting dolphins. So they are to be congratulated for the great work they have done. This legislation hopefully will be an improvement. I commend all of those who have had a chance to be involved in it. 
One concern that I do have is directly related to the labeling issue. As many of you know, the debate on the tuna-dolphin issue has a long and tortuous history. It was our own industry, primarily the U.S. canners, who started the dolphin-safe movement by voluntarily adopting that label back in 1990. It took several years and many millions of dollars to educate the American consumer about what the dolphin-safe label means. It was because of the industry's efforts and congressional backing that we still have that label today. 
But today, when we pass S. 39, the Congress will establish criteria by which to evaluate the appropriateness of the dolphin-safe label. The definition of the label may change, based upon further scientific studies. 
But let us not fool ourselves that there are some people who will oppose this change at all costs. One way to do this is through the use of alternative labels. 
The existence of alternative labels alone is not problematic, but the misuse of those labels to deceive or mislead the American public is a problem. The original version of S. 39 recognized this fact and prohibited other labels that referred to dolphins or other marine mammals on a can of tuna. It made sense from a practical point of view--if the Congress is establishing very strict criteria for a Government dolphin-safe label, then it should be the only such label. 
Opponents to this provision would argue on the right to free commercial speech. We must remember that commercial speech is not given the same degree of protection as individual speech. If a significant Government interest exists, then the Government can regulate such commercial speech. I believe that the conservation goals of the International Dolphin Conservation Program are such a significant Government interest. But in the spirit of compromise, I was willing to allow alternative labels under some strict conditions. 
Alternative labels can exist if they meet the minimum standards of the dolphin-safe label, including the no mortality or serious injury standard as well as the support of a tracking and verification program similar to that found in S. 39. If you want to claim that you are as safe as dolphin safe, then you must be able to prove it. Alternative labels are subject to all applicable labeling, marketing and advertising laws and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission Act--this only makes sense. 
But the concern on the misuse of alternative labels continues to exist. Our compromise would address this concern by forbidding any campaign or effort to mislead or deceive consumers about the level of protection afforded dolphins under the International Dolphin Conservation Program. 
Finally, we ask the Secretary of Commerce to monitor the situation. If alternative labels are used in such a way to undermine the conservation goals of the International Dolphin Conservation Program, then the Secretary will make a report to the Congress. If our efforts here today, and over the past 2 years, are being thwarted by a campaign to undercut the label or International Dolphin Conservation Program, then we should know and we should take action to eliminate this problem. 
Mr. President, I hope these safeguards are sufficient in dealing with the misuse of alternative labels. I can only support this bill if I know that our efforts and the goals of the binding international program are not being undone by a campaign which uses alternative labels to cerate market distinctions for the purpose of customer confusion or deception. I believe that we addressed this concern with our compromise. If not, I am sure that we shall visit this issue again. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the leadership of my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, who has helped guide this bill through to this day. I also would like to note the efforts of Senators Snowe and McCain who took a personal interest in protecting dolphins through an international agreement. My colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, helped to forge the compromise agreement which we stand to implement today. Of course, Senators Biden and Boxer should be noted for their continuing concern for dolphin protection--I am glad that our common interests were merged into common legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 39.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to discuss with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Hollings, and my distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, an important safety issue facing Jefferson Parish, LA. 
As my colleagues know, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office is one of the most progressive and notable law enforcement offices in the country. Unfortunately, they have been forced to use a conventional 450 MHz UHF radio system that is far too small and antiquated to handle current traffic volumes and to provide the secure and varied communications capabilities necessary in today's law enforcement environment. Replacing this old system with a new 800 MHz digital system is necessary to ensure the safety of its residents and guests, and to enhance the operational efficiencies of the sheriff's office. 
Hurricane Danny recently demonstrated the dire need for this new communications system. Grand Isle, off the southern-most part of Jefferson Parish, is a barrier island with approximately 2,500 residents. There is, however, only one road leading from Grand Isle to the mainland. When it appeared this road was at risk because of Danny's 70-75 mph winds and high tides, the sheriff's office decided to evacuate the island. Unfortunately, before the island could be safely evacuated, one of the radio towers was damaged and rendered inoperable by the hurricane. The sheriff's office was forced to borrow cellular telephones in order to evacuate the island.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as my colleague knows, the sheriff's office of Jefferson Parish has sought assistance in the past and has helped to highlight the need for Federal assistance to help local law enforcement agencies replace outdated communications equipment. In fact, the sheriff's office was influential in getting a discretionary grant program created in 1994 that would provide funds for these types of activities. However, Congress has consistently earmarked these funds, leaving no funds for grant applicants.

Mr. BREAUX. Section 761 of the bill provides standards that a State-sponsored workers' compensation company must meet in order to be exempt from Federal income tax for future years. As the chairman is aware, a large number of the States, including Louisiana, have State-sponsored workers' compensation companies that have been operating as tax-exempt agencies for several years. It is my understanding that the standards that we have proposed for the future are intended to codify the standards that exist under present law and that a company, such as the one established by the State of Louisiana, that met these standards in prior years should be confident that it is, in fact, tax exempt under current law. Is my understanding correct?

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. I won't be that long. I rise to commend the Democratic leader on our side, Senator Daschle, and others who have put together a major effort in trying to offer a package of democratically oriented tax cuts which, in great sincerity, many, many people feel would be, by far, the better way to proceed--a more balanced, more honest package of tax cuts and how those tax cuts should apply to society. 
I think that what he is offering is yeoman's work in terms of fairness and making sure that if there is going to be a tax cut, people who need them the most will benefit the most from those tax cuts. 
While I praise my Democratic leader, I rise to say that I will not be able to support that package when it is called to be voted. I say that because we do not live in a perfect world. Neither is the Congress a perfect place. Neither is the Finance Committee a perfect group of individuals who have the wisdom of Solomon to craft a perfect bill. But what we have crafted in the Senate Finance Committee, because of the work of both Democrats and Republicans working together, I think is a package that merits our support. 
It is a better package from many perspectives, but let me concentrate just on the Democratic perspective of why the bill, 
in fact, is better than when it started. 
First of all, there is $24 billion more money which is directed at children for health care, for young children who today do not have health care. That is a major, significant achievement. That was achieved in a bipartisan fashion with major input from Democrats who insisted that whatever money we are able to generate should be used for children who need help and need assistance. That is in this package which is before us today. 
There is $8 billion of additional assistance that was achieved because, in a bipartisan fashion, we agreed to raise the cigarette tax on tobacco products and use a portion of those revenues for insuring the most vulnerable among us, the children, for one of the most important things that we can help children with, and that is their health care, both now and in the future. That is the result of a bipartisan working arrangement in the Senate Finance Committee. 
In addition, I think that we have taken what was originally a Republican proposal to give everybody a $500-per-child tax credit that you could use for whatever purpose. You could use it to take care of your children, but you could also use it to buy alcohol, you could use it to go to the racetrack, you could use it for whatever purpose. In a bipartisan fashion, we worked to craft an amendment that said you will have these additional tax credits if you use a portion of it to educate your children. I suggest that there is not a better thing that we can do for families with children than to help those parents educate those children for the future so they can be successful members of our society. 
We, as Democrats, I think, argued against indexing of capital gains saying we can't afford it. Let's take a capital gains reduction, we hope it will increase jobs and increase expansion in business, but also don't take the next step of indexing it. Because of working it in a bipartisan fashion, that in fact is in the bill. 
Again, working in a bipartisan fashion, we made some tough decisions on Medicare and Medicaid, as a result of what we did, to try and bring about competition, to try and say we will make the tough decisions now and no longer will we have to say to people who tell us to fix Medicare, no longer will we say not now, not with us and not with this program. We have taken the tough decisions, and we have accepted them. When people say fix Medicare, this Finance Committee can say that we did what was necessary when we were called upon to make those decisions. 
So I think as you look at the total package, it is better than when it started. I, for one, as a person who participated in that process would feel less than totally honest if I was able to get the things that make it better in the package, and then when it came to vote for that package, walk away and say, `No, I am going to vote for something else.' That is not, I think, the way things should operate in a democratically elected body which is a divided Government. But while we have a divided Government, we do not have a divided Finance Committee. I think because of that bipartisan spirit and what we were able to do, today we have a better package before us. 
Again, I commend our Democratic leader for offering something that I think if we were in control would be the bill that would be before this committee. 
But that is not the case. But what is the case is a fairly arrived at package that makes this bill much better. I think it deserves our support.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Biomaterials Access Assurance and Health Safety act of 1997. While other legislation has been introduced that is intended to protect suppliers of raw materials used in the construction of important medical implants from liability, I believe that my legislation strikes the proper balance between the legitimate concerns of these suppliers and the health insurance and legal rights of patients. 
The legislation I am introducing today is similar to biomaterials legislation that has been introduced independently by Senator Lieberman and as a part of S. 5, the Product Liability Fairness Act. It does, however, differ on several important points. First, this bill would not immunize negligent suppliers or supplies who fail to warn of the harmful effects of their products. Second, this bill would be limited to the protection of suppliers of raw materials. Other biomaterials bills, while speaking only of the need to protect suppliers of raw materials, use overly broad language that immunizes a whole host of product manufacturers. Third, unlike the legislation sent to the President last year, this bill would not cover suppliers of materials used in breast implants. 
Mr. President, there are two other important differences between this legislation and other biomaterials liability legislation that has been introduced. I believe that this bill can be passed by Congress. I'm not sure that other biomaterials bills can. We know too well that the larger product liability bill will be controversial, and that its passage and enactment are uncertain at best. This biomaterials bill has been introduced as a stand-alone measure and can move independently of the product liability bill. 
I also believe that this legislation can be signed into law by President Clinton, and I'm not too sure that other biomaterials liability legislation can. When the President vetoed the product liability bill sent to him by the 104th Congress, H.R. 965, which included biomaterials language similar to that in Senator Lieberman's bill, he noted that he wanted to enact fair and balanced biomaterials liability legislation. However, he felt that the language before him went too far, particularly because it immunized negligent biomaterials suppliers. I believe the President will find the provisions of my bill acceptable.

Mr. BREAUX. My friend from Texas would refer to this provision as the `rotten' provision. I am sure what he meant to say was the `forgotten' provision, because he obviously forgot what we did to this in the Finance Committee when we greatly improved it. If anyone wants to have a $500-per-child tax cut, we presume that it is for the children. 
Under the suggestion of the Senator from Texas, we would give the family a $500 tax rate to use for whatever they want. If they want to use it to go to the casino, fine. If they want to use it to buy a six-pack of booze every week, fine. It is about $9.66 a week, so under the provision of the Senator from Texas they could take it, put it in their pocket, and don't use it for children at all--just do whatever you want with it. 
Interestingly, the Citizen Council, a respected voice of both parties, says, `In our view, a no-strings child credit is a cruel hoax on the very children who are supposed to benefit from it. We expect that most of the credits would disappear into the family's general budgets, or be used to pay bills'--and I add, not for the children, that the tax credit is supposed to be for. 
What we have done is to craft a compromise from zero to 13, the family can use it for anything they would like, no strings attached, but from 13 to 17, when children need to be educated, there is an obligation that the tax credit be used to educate the children. For all of us who want to help children and our families and help parents raise those children, what is better than to give that family help and assistance in educating that child? 
Some say the Tax Code should not tell people what to do. The Tax Code is full of examples--a mortgage deduction is only available if you buy a house; a charitable contribution is only available if, in fact, you give to charity. So what I think the Finance Committee was able to do was to erect a compromise, a blending of what that suggestion was coming from this side, blending it with what many of our people said, use it for educating children. If we are going to have a tax credit for children, let's at least ensure that part of the time it is used for one of the basic functions that a family has as an obligation to those children, and that is to educate those children. 
So I think that what we have come forward with makes a great deal of sense. It is a legitimate compromise. It adds to the education package which I think everyone is for, and it helps families with small children.

Mr. BREAUX. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. President, this is really an interesting dialog because on the one hand we have some facts that are uncontested; that is, if we do not do anything to fix Medicare, it is not going to be around for anybody by the year 2001 because that is the year when, if we do not do anything, we are not going to have enough money in the Medicare Program to pay benefits to nobody. 
So it is very clear that Congress now has to do something 
if it is going to be around for everybody who is counting on it when they reach retirement age. 
It is really interesting. In the Finance Committee we have had people come before the committee all of the time saying, `You all have to fix Medicare. If is very important. It is the lifeblood or lifeline for seniors in this country.' 
Then we ask them when they tell us to fix it, `All right. Do you want to increase premiums?" 
`No. We don't want you to do that.' 
Then we say, `Well, would you want to decrease the payments going to doctors and hospitals?" 
They generally say, `Don't do that either because doctors and hospitals will soon quit treating Medicare patients because they are not getting paid enough for those services.' 
Then we say, `Well, would you like us to increase the age limit of people who are eligible for Medicare?" 
They say, `Oh. No. Don't do that.' 
But then, the bottom line: They say when they leave the committee room, `Be sure you fix it, by the way. Make sure it doesn't go broke in the year 2001. Fix it. But don't, don't, don't do anything that is necessary in order to fix it.' 
That is an impossible suggestion for the members of the committee and the Members of Congress to adopt. If we do nothing it will not be around for anyone. 
In 1965, when Congress in its wisdom passed the Medicare Program, the life expectancy for people at that time was 66.8 years of age for men; 73 years of age for women. So Congress in its wisdom at that time said, `Well, let's make an appropriate date for the beginning of Medicare benefits at 65.' 
Guess what has happened since 1965? For every year the life expectancy of Americans has increased. But the eligibility age for Medicare has not been increased one time. We did it for Social Security. What this committee does is to say, `Let's put the glidepath for Medicare eligibility the same as Social Security, recognizing that people in fact live substantially longer and draw Medicare benefits substantially longer, I might add as well. It almost sounds like we are getting these calls in our offices from people who are retiring, none of which are affected by this amendment--not a single one because they already are on Medicare. In fact, it goes down quite a ways before anybody is affected whatsoever. 
An interesting point is that it sounds like we are talking about having all of this going into effect immediately, when just the opposite is true. The amendment that was offered, I guess by Members from our side, takes 24 years to increase it 24 months. It doesn't increase it the first year to the age 67. You start off right where you are today, and it is increased 2 months a year and over 4 years we get to the age of 67 which is comparable to what we have in Social Security. 
Would it be nice if we didn't have to do that? Sure. Would it be nice if we didn't have to do anything to fix Medicare? Absolutely. The problem is we have a system that is in the tank as far as being able to survive, if we do not do anything. It would be wonderful to say make no changes and everybody continues to get exactly what you get at the time you are eligible for it. That is not an option. None of the options are easy. This one I would argue is far easier than any of the others, and it helps allow for Medicare to continue for a long period of time.

Mr. BREAUX. I thank the distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member. There is no easy answer to this problem. Everybody wants us to fix Medicare, but nobody wants us to do anything in order to fix it. 
When you say, `Do you want to increase premiums,' everybody says no. When you say, `Do you want to reduce benefits,' everybody says no. When you say, `Do you want to reduce payments of doctors and hospitals,' they say no because they may not serve us any more. When we say, let's gradually, by the year 2027, forewarn people that that will be the eligible age of Medicare, we are now saying do not do that, either. 
The fact is that in the year 2001 Medicare becomes insolvent. What are we going to tell the people then? Are we going to say we did not have the political courage to do anything, so there is no more Medicare available for anybody, regardless of age? That is what is facing us now. This is probably one of the easiest steps 
toward ensuring that Medicare will be solvent. There are no easy answers, and I suggest that this is one of the easier ones. If we do not have the political courage to do this, how are we going to handle the question about what happens when there is no more Medicare available for anyone? 
I think this ought to be adopted.

We ask the question, when are we going to fix it? And some say, well, not now. And we ask the question, well, who is going to fix it? And we say, not us. And then they ask the question, well, how are we going to fix it? And the response is, well, not this way, but fix it. 
I think that the politics of the issue at hand before the Senate is really very confusing to me. I cannot imagine going to my State of Louisiana and talking to a truck driver who is making, say, $25,000 a year, and supporting a wife and two children, and explain to him how it is correct and good policy 
to say that he and his two children and his wife are going to subsidize a retired couple that is making over $75,000 a year in retirement income. 
As a Democrat, how do I handle that? I suggest as a Republican, how do I explain that? It is not explainable. It is not good politics. Even more important, it is not good Government. 
Medicare is going to be insolvent in the year 2001. We have an obligation to try and fix it. I think it is good policy to say to that person who works every day and maybe makes $25,000 that we no longer are going to ask you to subsidize somebody's doctor's insurance that may be sitting home, in retirement, collecting over $100,000 a year, clipping coupons. 
Now, you would think that good policy for both parties would be to say we want to help the guy who is struggling to raise his two children, support his wife, who makes $25,000 a year, by asking someone who is retired that makes over $75,000 a year in retirement to pay a little bit more of what he is getting from the Government. 
We asked the Congressional Research Service--and certainly they are bipartisan, nonpartisan--how many people are affected by this change? They said that approximately 1.6 million people in the Nation age 65 or older, one-half of 1 percent of the noninstitutionalized people, not in hospitals or homes, have adjusted gross income at or above the threshold that this bill provides for--$50,000 for a single person or $75,000 for a couple filing their return.

Mr. BREAUX. That means only 1.6 percent of the people filing returns would be affected by this. How many millions of people do we have back in our States that are making $25,000 and continuing to subsidize those who are in retirement income? The average income in my State for working people is about $22,000 or $23,000. We have very few people that are retired that make over $75,000 a couple--almost none. 
I am happy to yield.

Mr. BREAUX. It is not necessarily just the financial situation we are looking at. We are looking at something that is called fairness. When we, as Democrats, look at trying to tax people that are making $25,000 and a blue-collar job, driving a truck in my State of Louisiana, and telling that couple that they should be subsidizing someone who makes $100,000 a year who is retired, that is not good policy. 
So this is a policy change as much as it is anything else. It is a question of fairness. We have a system that is going broke and we are going to make changes. The changes should be fair. I suggest this is a fair and equitable change to ask for those who can most afford it to pay a little bit more so those who can least afford it will not have to continue to subsidize those who are very well-off in retirement. That is a fair test. It is a good proposal. I suggest that we support it.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise for a moment or two to speak to a bill which Senator Mack and I are introducing today on the entire question of Medicare. So many people around the country have heard Congress and elected officials for a long period of time talk about how we need to reform the Medicare Program. The Medicare Program has been a wonderful program since 1965. It has assured our senior citizens they will have adequate health care in a period in their lives when health care is vitally important. 
We have all seen the studies and the reports which clearly point out that unless Congress fundamentally reforms this program, it is not going to be around for much longer. We clearly see a program that will be bankrupt, which is running out of money, and that has to be a tremendous concern not only to our Nation's seniors but also to their children and their grandchildren and to society at large. Unfortunately, every time Congress moves toward trying to reform Medicare, we do not do it. We have taken the same approach year in and year out with the thought of fixing Medicare with a Band-Aid type of approach instead of addressing the fundamental defects in the program. We have every year said we are going to fix it this year by reducing the reimbursement fees that doctors and hospitals get for treating Medicare patients. 
I said the other day, and others have made this comment, that before too long doctors and hospitals will refuse to take Medicare patients because their reimbursement rate from the Government will be less than it costs them to do business, that they will simply refuse to take Medicare patients any longer. 
That is already happening in my own family. My mother-in-law just a week ago informed us that after being diagnosed with an ailment of diabetes, in trying to go to a local physician in our State of Louisiana, they promptly informed her they do not take Medicare patients. I think that is something we all need to be very concerned about. We cannot continue to try to fix Medicare with a proposal that truly does not fix it. 
What we introduce today is a proposal to make an option available to Medicare recipients which is patterned on the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan that every Member of the Senate and every Member of the House and all 9 million Federal employees have. 
It is a program which is fundamentally different than Medicare because, unlike Medicare, it is based on competition in the marketplace as opposed to arbitrary price fixing of Medicare services, which is the current system under Medicare based here in Washington. 
There was an interesting story in the Washington Post this morning which talked about how House and Senate committees are looking at bringing about reform to Medicare and Medicaid and basing that reform on the Federal health plan available to Members of Congress and other Federal employees. Unfortunately, while the Medicare proposals which are now pending in the House and the Senate will increase the range of options available to seniors, they lack the most important feature of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. That is competition. Medicare is the only program that fails to deliver health care based on competition but does it based on arbitrary price fixing, which is no longer working. 
The proposals currently in both the House and the Senate plan would continue to base what we pay managed care programs on what we spend on the so-called fee-for-service, currently available under Medicare. And that is the problem. There is not fundamental reform. 
I think most committees are to be commended. Our Finance Committee draft does recognize that there is a problem. But in trying to reduce the costs of Medicare by $115 billion, almost all of those savings come out of reducing payments to doctors and hospitals. I have said what the problem is there. Doctors and hospitals will begin to refuse to take Medicare patients. That, certainly, is not going to help anyone. 
So what we are recommending, Senator Mack and I, by our approach, is to introduce a test program over a 5-year period to try to fundamentally reform Medicare; to set up demonstration projects around the country to allow competitive bidding and negotiations to take part in the delivery of Medicare services to seniors in this country. We had an interesting report the other day in our Aging Committee that pointed out we are overpaying managed care programs under Medicare by almost $2 billion a year more than it is costing them to treat the patients. That is because it is not based on competition, but rather on an arbitrary, bureaucratic program that is run out of a department here in Washington. I don't fault the program managers and the bureaucrats. That is how Congress set it up. But while it may have been a good idea in 1965, in 1997 it is no longer working. It is totally out of step with the way health care services need to be delivered in this country. 
So what the Breaux-Mack proposal says is that we are going to take a look at how the Federal employee plan works; we are going to do some demonstration projects around the country; we are going to take those results, and Congress will act on those results. We will not just let the study sit on a shelf somewhere in a library and not have anything happen with it, but rather we will have the Congress actually take those recommendations and act on those recommendations. 
We are convinced that with this new approach, Medicare beneficiaries will get more services. We start off with a basic standardized plan that in addition to what is now available to Medicare patients, also includes prescription drugs, which is incredibly important. We also guarantee this basic package will be available to all of the people we are proposing. But the fundamental difference is they will have more information about the plans, so the plans will be able to be compared for people to see which plan is the best. So we will create a situation where Medicare beneficiaries will have more services offered to them, more choices of which plan they would like to consider, more benefits under those plans, and we think we can clearly do it for less money than is being spent on the program right now. 
One of the features of our program is that it sets up an office of competition, much like the private plans that are available now to Federal employees. We think that an office of competition will be able to call for people to actually come in and submit proposals. Then, after they look at these proposals and make sure they meet the standardized package of benefits, they will begin to negotiate with these people who are offering these plans to our seniors in the United States. 
Competition is a wonderful thing. For the right to treat 38 million Medicare recipients, people will compete. They will say, `Our plan is better than their plan. Our plan offers more 
than their plan. Our plan can do it at a better price.' There will be a competitive world set up that is not now available to Medicare recipients. 
That is the fundamental problem, I think, that the House and Senate bills, and respective Finance and Ways and Means Committee bills, do not address. It still says we are going to continue to fix prices out of Washington for Medicare recipients. I think that every think tank we have talked to--and Senator Mack and I have met with liberal think tanks and conservative think tanks, and people who have spent a lifetime studying this problem. Generally, they all have come to the same conclusion--that greater competition in the marketplace will allow health providers to offer more services to senior citizens and do it at a better price. 
So we are going to introduce today legislation that does establish a Medicare reform package or proposals which we think represent fundamental reform in the system. We are not saying that all seniors have to move into this program immediately. No, we are saying we ought to have a demonstration project in 10 cities around the country and in rural areas around America, to see how it would work, do this test marketing for about a 5-year period, until we can get a great deal of information about what is happening out there when you try to reform this system, then take that information and bring it back to the Congress and have Congress act on that recommendation. We think that is something that makes a great deal of sense. 
I think it is a balanced way to proceed. We are not rushing into it. We are not telling seniors they have to do something overnight, but merely giving them the choice during this period of time. I think that is what seniors really want. They want the choice. They want more information. They want a better benefit package. And all of us want, bottom line, to see that this program is going to be around for when we move into it, when our children move into it, when the baby-boomer generation we hear so much talk about is ready to participate in the program. 
We clearly cannot continue down the same path that we have continued on for so many years, since 1965. We think the Breaux-Mack proposal is a realistic alternative. It merits bipartisan support, and we hope both committees ultimately will bring to the floor a type of program based on what myself and Senator Mack will be introducing in the Congress today.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to two men who have become an institution in my hometown of Crowley, LA. 
For 40 years now, Bill Williams and Shel Kanter have hosted the very popular `Bill and Shel Show' on radio station KSIG-AM. Each weekday morning, Bill and Shel have entertained and informed thousands of listeners throughout Acadia Parish and the surrounding area. For most listeners of the `Bill and Shel Show,' it's hard to imagine starting the day without them and their reports of the latest local news, community events, and the all-important school updates, including the school lunch menus. 
As anyone who has tried to raise funds for a charitable cause in Crowley knows, a kind or encouraging word from Bill and Shel can sometimes make the difference between success or failure. Bill and Shel, of course, have always been most generous with kind words for the various worthy causes in and around Crowley. 
It wasn't too long ago that the `Bill and Shel Show' was threatened with extinction. When KSIG Radio changed ownership, the new owners briefly considered canceling the show. Of course, as one might imagine, the enormous outcry of protest from the community quickly persuaded the station's new management that its initial decision had been perhaps hasty and unwise. Today, I am happy to report that Bill and Shel continue to entertain and inform their many listeners and, presumably, will continue to dominate the local airwaves for many years to come. 
In this day and time when all of us decry the decline in the spirit of community and cohesiveness that once was the hallmark of small towns all across our land, the `Bill and Shel Show' serves as a reminder of a time when small towns like Crowley--where neighborliness, community spirit, and civic pride still thrive--were the norm, not the exception. It is people like Bill Williams and Shel Kanter who help make Crowley a place where people are truly connected by a common purpose and a sincere concern for the well-being of the entire community. 
I congratulate the owners and management of KSIG Radio for their decision to keep Bill and Shel on the air. And I congratulate Bill and Shel for 40 years of broadcasting excellence.

Mr. BREAUX. I agree with the majority leader. This legislation represents a strong reaffirmation to the world of the United States steadfast support for the Jones Act. 
Furthermore, the House of Representatives amended H.R. 2754 to clearly preserve the authority of the Secretary of Defense to define, for the purposes of exclusion from coverage under the agreement, the terms `military vessel', `military reserve 
vessel', and `essential security interest'. While the administration and the Office of the USTR attempted to define `military reserve vessel' by including a description of current military reserve vessel programs, some have expressed concerns that this approach might in the future limit the flexibility of the Secretary of Defense to implement additional programs, such as the National Defense Features Program. I am working with Senator Lott to redraft this provision in a way that will not limit United States national security options.

Mr. BREAUX. H.R. 2754, as amended by the House of Representatives, would have required that third country anti-dumping cases taken by the Office of the USTR to the third country be adjudicated in a manner similar to that provided by the agreement. Some were concerned that S. 629 would require that the injurious pricing action be taken in accordance with the laws of that third country, without regard to whether those laws are consistent with the agreement. I intend to work with Senator Lott to ensure that such third country proceedings are consistent with the injurious pricing actions of the agreement.

Mr. BREAUX. I thank you, Madam President. 
I am not for Joe Camel, but I am for this budget agreement. I think that the question before the Senate today is, are we willing to run the risk of unraveling an agreement that has been entered into by Republican Members working in good faith with Democratic Members working in good faith with this administration to try to do something that we have not been able to do for many years? 
We shut the Government down in the last Congress because we could not agree on a budget. You talk about affecting children. When you shut down all the services of the Government, you affect young people, you affect children, you affect senior citizens, and you affect every aspect of our society. We did that in the last Congress because we could not come together and agree on a budget that was balanced in terms not only of spending but of how we spend the money that we are allocated to spend. 
We have a historical agreement in front of us that breaks that pattern of not being able to work together, by coming together and saying, yes, there are Democratic priorities and, yes, there are Republican priorities, and both sides have to give. 
It is really interesting that the people who have said that they cannot support this agreement--I respect their positions; they are good citizens, they are good Congress men and women, they are good Members of the Senate. But if you look at where the opposition is coming from, it is not from the center, it is not from the mainstream, it is from more liberal Members and more conservative Members. Again, I respect their positions. But what we have been able to put together is a budget agreement that can work. 
There will be all kinds of efforts to try to change that agreement. I am concerned those efforts will do damage to the overall agreement. Generally, when things sound so simple, they generally do not work, and this sounds so simple: Let's insure more children, and do it by raising the tax on a product that many people do not like. If it sounds so simple it is too good to be true, generally it is. 
I think what we are neglecting to focus in on is what this agreement already has in it. This fragile agreement already has about $16.8 billion in it right now without this amendment to insure more children who are currently uninsured. That is a major achievement. 
Should we insure every child? Of course. But we cannot do it all at once. This agreement insures 5 million more currently uninsured children in this country. $16.8 billion is already in 
this budget package for that purpose. I know that you know certainly the folks who support increasing it right now--I mean, their intentions are good intentions. I agree with their intentions. The question is not should we do it? The question is how we do it, how we do it in the context of the other priorities we have as a nation and as a society. 
Just this week, I think yesterday, in the other body, our friends on the other side of the Capitol, some said, `Well, we ought to spend more money for highways.' There is no question about that. We need more transportation, better transportation, we need mass transportation, we need highways, we need to fix the bridges that are crumbling down that when they fall they kill people, highways that kill people every year, 40,000 deaths on highways, much of it as a result of inadequate highway systems in this country. 
Should we improve highways? Of course. Should we spend more money on highways? Yes. The question is how we go about getting there. This budget provides a blueprint, a map, a way to get from here to there that has been agreed to by Republican leaders, by Democratic leaders, and by the administration. 
I just say that we have a plan of action. I suggest that we support that plan of action, and, in doing so, we are going to have to be called upon to say no to some ideas and concepts that I have no disagreement with. Of course we want to do this. Of course I want to move in that direction. 
Again, the question today is not whether we should do it, but how we go about doing it. I suggest that the fragile package that is before us is the proper approach to solving the problem of uninsured children in this country. Five million more insured under this budget package is a major, major achievement. We should be proud of it. 
Should we discontinue our efforts? Of course not. We should continue to work and to expand. There will be ways offered in the respective committees in order to achieve those goals. But I suggest that this is not the right approach at this time. 
I think that one of the concerns I have is that if the whole entire budget agreement begins to unravel and fall apart we run the risk of doing a great deal more damage, not just to one segment of our population, but to the entire country. We did that in the last Congress. It was not a proud moment for this body nor the other body. 
I think we have come a long way since then. Let us not go back to those days. I suggest that we should stick with the budget package. That is the right thing to do.

Mr. BREAUX. I congratulate the Senator for making this point, that every budget we have had in the past and been signed into law is necessarily a compromise. There are a lot of things that a lot of people would like in this legislation that are not there. I know the Senator from California has talked about additional children being covered. I support that effort. I mentioned the highway bill. We need money for transportation. We have talked about needing more money for schools, to try to fix schools that are falling down around the country. The point is, and I think the Senator from California is making it, that we have to deal with an agreement that has the chance of passing, if the $16 billion for more child care that is in this budget now ever has a chance to become law. 
I would say, as one member of the Senate Finance Committee, we are going to look at exactly what the essence of this amendment does in the Senate Finance Committee. There is no problem with us considering this approach and voting on it and adding it to later legislation coming down the pike. So this does not mean this is over. We can continue to look at this suggested means in future legislation. 
I thank the Senator.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce the Private Wireless Spectrum Availability Act of 1997. This legislation will help the more than 300,000 U.S. companies, both large and small, that have invested $25 billion in internally owned and operated wireless communications systems. It will provide these companies with critically needed spectrum and will do so through an equitable lease fee system. 
The private wireless communications community includes industrial, land transportation, business, educational, and philanthropic organizations that own and operate communications systems for their internal use. The top 10 U.S. industrial companies have more than 6,000 private wireless licenses. Private wireless systems also serve America's small businesses in the utility, contracting, taxi, and livery industries. 
These internal-use communications facilities greatly enhance public safety and the quality of American life. They also support global competitiveness for American firms. For example, private wireless systems support: the efficient production of goods and services; the safe transportation of passengers and products by land and air; the exploration, production, and distribution of energy; agricultural enhancement and production; the maintenance and development of America's infrastructure; and compliance with various local, State, and Federal operational government statutes. 
Current regulatory policy inadequately recognizes the public interest benefits that private wireless licensees provide to the American public. Consequently, allocations of spectrum to these private wireless users has been deficient. Private wireless entities received spectrum in 1974 and 1986 when the FCC allocated channels in the 800 megahertz and 900 megahertz bands. Over time, however, the FCC has significantly reduced the number of channels available to industrial and business entities in those allocations. Private wireless entities now have access to only 299 channels, or 32 percent of the channels of the original allocation. 
Spectrum auctions have done a great job of speeding up the licensing of interpersonal communications services and have generated significant revenues for the U.S. Treasury. They have also unfortunately skewed the spectrum allocation process toward subscriber-based services and away from critical radio services such as private wireless which are exempted from auctions. Nearly 200 megahertz of spectrum has been allocated for the provision of commercial telecommunications services, virtually 
all of which has been assigned by the FCC through competitive bidding. 
Competitive bidding is not the proper assignment methodology for private wireless telecommunications users. Private wireless operations are site-specific systems which vary in size based on that user's particular needs, and are seldom mutually exclusive from other private wireless applicants. Auctions, which depend on mutually exclusive applications and use market areas based on population, simply cannot be designed for private wireless systems. 
This legislation mandates that the FCC allocate no less than 12 megahertz of new spectrum for private wireless use as a measure to maintain our industrial and business competitiveness in the global arena, as well as to protect the welfare of the employees in the American workplace. Research indicates that private wireless companies are willing to pay a reasonable fee in return for use of spectrum. They recognize that their access to spectrum increases with their willingness to pay fair value for the use of this national asset. 
My bill grants the FCC legislative authority to charge efficiency-based spectrum lease fees in this new spectrum allocation. These lease fees should encourage the efficient use of spectrum by the private wireless industry, generate recurring annual revenues as compensation for the use of spectrum, and retain spectrum ownership by the public. Furthermore, the fees should be easy for private frequency advisory committees to calculate and collect.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to make technical changes to the Medicare hospice benefit which will ensure that high-quality hospice services will be available to all terminally ill Medicare beneficiaries. This legislation is identical to H.R. 521, introduced by Representative Cardin. 
Hospices care for and comfort terminally ill patients at home or in home-like settings. There are 2,800 hospice programs in all 50 States and in 1995 they cared for more than 390,000 patients. One out of every three people who died from cancer or AIDS were cared for by hospice. 
Services provided under the Medicare hospice benefit include physician services, nursing care, drugs for symptom management, pain relief, short term inpatient and respite care, and counseling both for the terminally ill and their families. But terminally ill patients who elect hospice care opt out of most other Medicare services related to their terminal illness. 
Hospice services permit terminally ill people to die with dignity, usually in the comforting surroundings of their own homes with their loved ones nearby. Hospice is also a cost-effective form of care. At a time when Medicare is pushing to enroll more beneficiaries in managed care plans, hospice is already managed. Hospices provide patients with whatever palliative services are needed to manage their terminal illness, and they are reimbursed a standard per diem rate, based on the intensity of care needed and the location of the provision of care. 
With 28 percent of all Medicare costs now going toward the care of people in their last year of life, and almost 50 percent of those costs spent during the last 2 months of life, cost-effective alternatives are needed. Studies show hospices reduce Medicare spending. A 1995 Lewin study showed that for every dollar Medicare spent on hospice, it saved $1.52 in Medicare part A and part B expenditures. Similarly, a 1989 study commissioned by the Health Care Financing Administration showed savings of $1.26 for every Medicare dollar spent on hospice. 
Since 1982, when the hospice benefit was added to the Medicare statute, more and more Americans have chosen to spend their final months of life in this humane and cost-effective setting. Yet in recent years, it has become clear that certain technical changes are needed in the Medicare hospice benefit to protect beneficiaries and ensure that a full range of cost-effective hospice services continue to be available. The bill I am 
introducing today makes these necessary technical changes. 
First, the Medicare Hospice Benefits Amendments of 1997 restructure the hospice benefit periods. The basic eligibility criteria do not change. Under this bill, as in current law, a person is eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit only if two physicians have certified that the patient is terminally ill with a life expectancy of six months or less. Patients who elect to receive hospice benefits give up most other Medicare benefits unless and until they withdraw from the hospice program. 
While this bill does not change hospice eligibility criteria, it does change how the benefit periods are structured. Currently, the Medicare benefit consists of four benefit periods. At the end of each of the first three periods, the patient must be recertified as being terminally ill. The fourth benefit period is of unlimited duration. However, a patient who withdraws from hospice during the fourth hospice period forfeits his ability to elect hospice services in the future. Thus, patients who go into remission, and are thus no longer eligible for hospice because their life expectancy exceeds 6 months, cannot return to hospice when their condition worsens. 
This bill restructures the hospice benefit periods to eliminate the existing open-ended fourth benefit period and to provide that after the first two 90-day periods, patients are reevaluated every 60 days to ensure they still qualify for hospice services. This restructuring ensures that those receiving Medicare benefits are able to receive hospice services at the time they need them and can be discharged from hospice care with no penalty if their prognosis changes. 
Second, the bill clarifies that ambulance services, diagnostic tests, radiation, and chemotherapy are covered under the hospice benefit when they are included in the patient's plan of care. No separate payment will be made for these services, but hospices will have to provide them when they are found to be necessary as a palliative measure. This change conforms the statute to current Medicare regulatory policy and does not cost Medicare any additional money because payments are covered by the current per-diem payments. 
Third, the bill also permits hospices to have independent contractor relationships with physicians. Under current law, hospices must directly employ their medical directors and other staff physicians. This creates a legal problem in some States which prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, and the requirement has made it increasingly difficult to recruit part-time hospice physicians. 
Fourth, the bill creates a mechanism to allow waiver of certain staffing requirements for rural hospices, which often have difficulty becoming Medicare-certified because of shortages of certain health professionals. Currently, about 80 percent of hospices are Medicare-certified or pending certification. 
Finally, this bill provides some administrative flexibility regarding certification of terminal illness. Currently, the statute requires that paperwork documenting physician certification of a patient's terminal illness be completed within a certain number of days of the patient's admission to hospice. This bill will eliminate the strict statutory requirements. It gives the Health Care Financing Administration the discretion, as it currently has with home health certifications, to require hospice certifications to be on file before a Medicare claim is submitted. 
The Medicare Hospice Benefit Amendments of 1997 are noncontroversial and should not affect Medicare spending, but they will make important and necessary changes to the Medicare hospice benefit, to enable hospices to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to the terminally ill, and to protect beneficiaries who depend on these services.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today with Mr. Bryan, Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Frist to introduce the Distilled Spirits Tax Payment Simplification Act of 1997, a bill more readily known as All-in-Bond. This bill would streamline the way in which the government collects federal excise tax on distilled spirits by extending the current system of collection now applicable only to imported products to domestic products as well. 
Today wholesalers purchase foreign bottled distilled spirits in bond--tax free--paying the Federal excise tax directly after sale to a retailer. In contrast, when the wholesaler buys domestically bottled spirits--nearly 86 percent of total inventory--the price includes the Federal excise tax, pre-paid by the distiller. This means that hundreds of U.S. family-owned wholesale businesses increase their inventory carrying costs by 40 percent when buying U.S. products, which often have to be financed through borrowing. 
Under my bill, wholesalers would be allowed to purchase domestically bottled distilled spirits in-bond from distillers just as they are now permitted to purchase foreign produced spirits. Products would become subject to tax on removal from wholesale premises. This legislation is designed to be revenue neutral and includes the requirement that any wholesaler electing to purchase spirits in bond must make certain estimated tax payments to Treasury before the end of the fiscal year. 
All-in-Bond is an equitable and sound way to streamline our tax collection system. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that would temporarily suspend, through the year 2000, the rate of duty applicable to imports of Diiodomenthyl-p-tolylsulfone, commonly referred to as `DMTS.' Commercially, DMTS is known by the brand name AMICAL 48. It is a fungicide/mildewcide that is used in caulks, adhesives, plastics, textiles, and for other purposes. The preservative is of indisputable benefit to a host of industries engaged in the production, storage, and use of products subject to microbial degradation. 
The current rate of duty on DMTS is 10.7 percent ad valorem. Under the Uruguay Round, this rate is scheduled to decrease by 0.6 percent per year until 2004, when it will reach and remain at 6.5 percent. The proposed legislation would provide for duty-free treatment of imports of DMTS from the date of enactment through the last day of the year 2000, and it is estimated that if this legislation is enacted, the reduction in duty collection will be a de minimis amount of about $250,000 to $350,000 per year. 
Furthermore, because there is no substitute domestic product currently benefiting from the present rate of duty on DMTS, no adverse impact on the domestic preservatives industry is anticipated. It may also be that such a temporary suspension in the rate of duty will result in savings being passed along to the consumers of AMICAL 48. I therefore urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 1997 with my colleagues Senators Cochran, Conrad, Dorgan, Moseley-Braun, Reid, and Rockefeller. 
Let me share some tragic facts about colorectal cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is the second most deadly cancer based on the number of annual deaths. While breast cancer primarily afflicts women and prostate cancer is a disease of men, colorectal cancer strikes both men and women of all races, resulting in the high number of patients and the corresponding high number of deaths. 
This year alone, 140,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer and 54,000 Americans will die from the disease. In my own State of Louisiana, 2,200 new cases of colon cancer will be diagnosed this year and it will take the lives of 920 people. Yet, as is the case with most cancers, colon cancer is preventable and curable if detected early. 
The tragedy of colorectal cancer is that physicians have proven means to detect colorectal cancer early but these tests must be made available to people on a widespread basis. Death from this terrible disease can be reduced significantly by early detection. We know polyps, the initial presentation of early cancers, if detected early can be treated without major surgery while expensive, major surgery in a hospital is the only successful treatment for more advanced cancers. 
While many private health plans are starting to provide coverage for colorectal cancer screening, Medicare--which covers older Americans who are most at risk--does not. The Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 1997 would make colorectal cancer screening available to Medicare beneficiaries to improve the chance for early detection and diagnosis. 
The type and frequency of screening I suggest in my bill are compatible with the recommendations of several large physician groups as well as the American Cancer Society. It covers all the procedures that are currently used today but the type of screening process will depend on the patient's risk factors for colon cancer. Patients at higher risk, for example someone whose parent had colon cancer, receive more aggressive screening than someone with a normal risk for colon cancer. 
Mr. President, this legislation is not procedure specific. Although several screening tests for colorectal cancer are currently available, the best method for early detection has not been determined. Some tests are very simple and can be performed by any doctor. Others, such as barium enema and colonoscopy, are technically more difficult and require special equipment and facilities. Some tests only evaluate part of the colon. 
My bill basically recognizes that we need to start screening people right away. The Congress should not prevent seniors from getting screened because there is disagreement over which procedures are best. That is a decision best made by doctors, not the Congress. This bill would mandate that seniors on Medicare have access to all the screening methods currently used by doctors. In 2 years, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will report back to Congress on which tests are the best and most cost-effective means of detecting colon cancer. If it is determined that a procedure is being used that is not effective, Medicare will no longer cover it. HHS will also study the needs of African-Americans who are at high risk for colon cancer and have a higher mortality rate. It makes much more sense for the experts in colon cancer, not the Congress, to determine the best, most cost-effective screening techniques all the while making this important service available immediately to Medicare beneficiaries. 
This kind of preventive tool is critical in our battle against colon cancer. It will improve the quality of life for Medicare beneficiaries and save Medicare money in the long run by reducing the high costs of treating advanced colorectal cancer.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that will enhance employee ownership in businesses across America. The ESOP Promotion Act of 1997, which I introduce today with my colleague, Senator Hatch of Utah, will facilitate employee ownership and retirement savings and enhance the opportunities for America's entrepreneurs to gain improved access to capital. This legislation would both improve and update a number of obsolete operating rules for employee stock ownership programs and would implement the full intent of Congress, which last year passed legislation designed to make ESOP's available to Subchapter S corporations. 
The ESOP Promotion Act benefits the owners and workers in the 2 million S corporations which exist in every industry in every State across America. As the country's principal corporate vehicle for entrepreneurs and family business startups, S corporations have long been engines of economic growth. Unfortunately, the restrictions placed on these businesses have also resulted, more recently, in reduced capital access for S corporations. For an S corporation which had hit the limit on the number of allowable shareholders or the amount of personal debt that its owners could assume to keep the company in business, there has been a burdensome capital crunch affecting not only these companies directly, but hindering the ability of our entire national economy to realize its growth potential. 
Last year, as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1997, Congress enabled S corporations to have ESOP's. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that measure, which by allowing S corporation ESOP's did two additional, critical things: it gave S corporations a new way to access funds without putting any new burdens on the Federal tax base, and it gave millions of workers a way to participate directly in the success and growth of the businesses which employed them. 
But despite the success we marked in 1996, the many S corporations which now want to build ESOP's cannot. The reason: there continues to be a number of largely technical hurdles in the Tax Code that make it difficult, if not impossible, to establish and sustain these employee ownership programs. 
One example of such a hurdle, is that, under current law, if an S corporation's ESOP distributes stock to its employee participants, and even one employee rolls over his stock into an entity that is not a permissible S corporation shareholder--say, an IRA account--then the company's Subchapter S election will be entirely invalidated. This, of course, is a risk that no S corporation is willing to take, and while the problem seems minor and technical on its face, no S corporation will establish an ESOP under these conditions. 
Another example of a technical disincentive is that, while S corporations were established in the 1950's as pass-through companies which pay a single layer of taxes, the S corporation ESOP would have to pay two layers of tax--one when the S corporation distributes stock to the ESOP, and the other when the ESOP distributes stock or cash to its 
participants. The second layer of tax was certainly not envisioned by Congress when we permitted S corporations to have ESOP's last year. Unfortunately, in its current form, this technicality means that an S corporation ESOP participant would pay a nearly 70 percent greater tax on his share of income than he would if he owned the company's stock directly. As such, S corporation ESOP's are not yet viable for employees, though we certainly intended that they would be when we established them. 
The legislation that we are introducing eliminates these and other technical problems by establishing parity between ESOP's sponsored by S corporations and those sponsored by C corporations; ensuring S corporation ESOP participants that they are subject to only one layer of taxation; and permitting employees to sell certain stock to an ESOP and defer tax on gain. 
In addition to the important S corporation measures in the legislation, the ESOP Promotion Act would improve the retirement savings opportunities for American workers. The bill would give employees the option to direct employers to retain dividends paid on employer stock in the ESOP/401(k) plan for reinvestment in the employer stock. Employees could then defer income taxes on the dividends and allow them to grow tax-free in their ESOP/401(k) plan until retirement. 
The bill would also correct an inequity to workers in the current tax law which provides an incentive for employers to pay the dividends to employees in cash, rather than to reinvest them in the ESOP/401(k) plan. Employers currently receive a tax deduction for dividends paid on stock held in the ESOP/401(k) plan only if the dividends are passed through to plan participants or are used to pay off an ESOP loan. The ESOP Promotion Act would provide employers with the tax deduction they currently receive on dividends paid on employer stock that is passed through to plan participants, if the dividends instead remain in the plan for reinvestment. This reinvestment opportunity for employees will enhance their retirement savings and facilitate employee ownership. 
Congress now has a responsibility for finishing the task we began last year--one that, perhaps, many of us believed we had completed--when we agreed that S corporations should have ESOP's and enacted a law to that effect. Our bill completes the task by making ESOP's useful and desirable for the millions of workers in S corporations, while ensuring that they are suitable for the companies that wish to sponsor ESOP's. Clearly when Congress enacted the S corporation ESOP provision, we expected that it would be functional by its effective date, which is January 1, 1998. I hope that my colleagues will support our legislation, and ensure that our intent is fully implemented by the end of this year.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President: today I introduce a bill to implement the OECD shipbuilding agreement to end foreign shipbuilding subsidies. This bill is an administration draft that I submit to better focus upcoming congressional discussion of the issues. With Europe just announcing $2.1 billion in new subsidies for its shipyards, the United States cannot afford to delay action on this agreement any longer. 
The United States has taken a leadership role in pushing for the elimination of unfair subsidies in the international commercial shipbuilding sector. In 1981, the United States unilaterally eliminated its own commercial shipbuilding subsidies. In October 1989, the United States, at the request of the six defense-oriented shipyards and the smaller commercial shipyards, initiated negotiations in the OECD aimed at eliminating trade distorting foreign shipbuilding subsidies. After 5 years of negotiations and constant prodding by the U.S. Congress, the OECD shipbuilding agreement was signed by the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Finland, Norway, and the United States on December 21, 1994. 
The OECD shipbuilding agreement, which covers over 80 percent of the world's commercial shipbuilding and repair capacity, would prohibit government subsidies to the shipbuilding industry, as well as discipline export credits, set common rules for government financing programs, and establish a mechanism for addressing injurious pricing, that is, dumping. As of June 1, 1996, all signatories, except the United States, had ratified the agreement. 
In the last Congress, several parties expressed serious concerns about certain aspects of the agreement and the proposed implementing legislation which we were unable to address before the end of the last session. As a result, the agreement's entry into force has been delayed by more than a year. I am hopeful that an agreement on implementing legislation can be reached early this session and I think the bill I am introducing today is a huge step in that direction. 
I am very concerned, however, that further delay in confirming United States commitment to this agreement will seriously undermine U.S. long-term efforts to eliminate foreign shipbuilding subsidies, especially as other countries face increased pressure to resume the granting of subsidies to their shipbuilding industries. The United States can't afford a shipbuilding subsidies race. We are cutting funding of important domestic programs now. The United States needs to approve and implement the shipbuilding agreement in order to give us the tools to challenge foreign subsidies and protect our shipbuilding industry against unfair foreign competition. 
I ask you to join the battle against unfair international shipbuilding subsidies by supporting the swift passage of legislation approving and implementing the OECD shipbuilding agreement.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today with Mr. D'Amato to introduce legislation that will improve the use of tax-exempt bonds as a financing mechanism for small manufacturing facilities and other important uses. 
The first thing our bill does is give States more flexibility under the annual $50 per capita or $150 million cap. Under current law, if the State designates bond money for a project and, for whatever reason, that project is not started in 3 years the State cannot put the bond money toward another project. This bill would allow States to reallocate that bond money to another type of project needed elsewhere in the State. 
In addition, the $10 million limit on capital expenditures a company can maintain and still qualify for this industrial bond money would increase to $20 million under our bill. The increase reflects the effects of inflation since 1978 when the program was first created and also corrects for future effects of inflation on a company's real worth. 
Finally, our bill would further clean up an omission in the current law. The 3-year carryover provision does not apply to small manufacturing facilities. In researching current law, it appears that denying carryover to manufacturing facilities is nothing more than an oversight. The legislation that we are introducing today will correct this error and allow Governors the flexibility to allow tax-exempt authority for manufacturing facilities to be carried over for 3 years in the same way as other activities allocated tax-exempt bonds. 
Tax-exempt bonds are essential for States to finance industrial development projects, ranging from small manufacturing facilities to pollution control and resource recovery facilities. Our legislation would help States fund industrial development and better allocate their scarce tax-exempt bond authority. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, what I want to talk to the Senate this morning and our colleagues about is the situation that I think is most serious in this Congress. If we balance the budget this year and also come up with tax cuts, I think that this Congress will still go down as a failure if we do nothing to address the very serious Medicare crisis that is facing this country. I think that we must realize that we need to do more than we are attempting to do at this moment. 
There is no question that Medicare has been a wonderful program for the 38 million Americans that have come under the Medicare Program for all of these years. It has been a success story that I think is unparalleled in the history of government. Before Medicare was passed less than half of the seniors in this country had access to quality health care. Today 99 percent of all seniors in America have quality health care under the Medicare Program. The poverty rate among seniors has dropped largely, on the part of Medicare and Social Security, from about 35 percent of all seniors down to about 12 percent. The United States has about the ninth highest life expectancy of any nation in the world. That is not that great. When you look at the life expectancy of seniors in this country, the United States has the highest life expectancy of all citizens over the age of 65 largely due to the fact they have access to quality health care under the Medicare Program. The problem, however, is that Medicare is about to go broke. We have talked about it. Now I think more and more people are understanding that we must do something to address the problem. 
The first chart that I have up here really is an indication of how part A, which is the hospital trust fund which pays for the hospital services for seniors, is projected by about the year 2001 to run out of money. We are right here starting to run out of money in the trust fund. And the red line shows that, indeed, this is a very serious crisis that we cannot allow to continue. The President's budget extends the life of the fund to the year 2007. That is a short-term fix when I suggest we should be looking at long-term fixes. 
Part B, which is the program that pays for physician services, is not in the same situation, obviously, because it is supported by general revenues although the cost of Medicare physician services has increased by 53 percent over the past 5 years. 
I would like to take a look at chart No. 2 which shows the number of people that are working in order to pay for the Medicare beneficiaries. Back in 1967 there were about 4.4 workers paying for every Medicare beneficiary. Today we are looking at a ratio of about 3.9 workers in 1995 right here. It is a dramatic drop down to the year 2030 when we are talking about only 2.2 American workers working to pay for one beneficiary. So while it started off in a very good ratio back in 1967 it is dropping as more and more people become eligible for Medicare and fewer and fewer workers are working to pay for those services. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that payroll taxes would have to be increased 25 percent a year just to extend the trust fund solvency to the year 2006. I don't know of any Member of Congress that is recommending a 25-percent increase in the payroll taxes, or something that is simply not going to occur. 
Chart No. 3 shows you how much money we are spending on Medicare as a percentage of our overall Federal budget. In 1975 it is 5 percent, more than double in 1995, and with 11.3 percent of the entire Federal budget now being spent on Medicare. By the year 2020 the estimation is that it will be almost 25 percent; 24-plus percent of our total budget expenditures. That means when you are talking about education, roads, highways, infrastructure, there is not going to be a lot of money left. We will be spending 25 percent of everything we take in just on Medicare. 
Why is this happening? There are two reasons. No. 1 is the growth of beneficiaries. There are a lot more people on Medicare. People live longer. The population is aging. We are glad they are. We are glad they are living longer. But we have a lot more beneficiaries than we used to. Between now and the year 2010 the number of people on Medicare will grow by about 1 1/2 percent a year. After that it is going to grow to almost 2.5 percent a year, which is a rate of growth that is just incredible and unreasonable for the cost. 
The second reason, as I point out on the chart, is the amount of money we are spending per beneficiary. We are spending a lot more. For a self-insured man who earned average wages he will receive Medicare benefits of over $44,000 a year in his lifetime. For these benefits he is only going to contribute about $13,000. He is getting about $32,000 more than he is putting in. We are spending a lot more per beneficiary. In 1995, the average benefit is $80,000 in a lifetime. Their contribution is $30,000. So we are spending a lot more money per beneficiary than we used to, and it is certainly a lot more money than they are contributing. 
So we know what is happening. Unfortunately, what we are talking about so far in the President's budget and in most proposals is to tinker around the edges. We are talking about, `Well, let's fix Medicare by cutting the amount of money we give to doctors and cutting the amount of money we give to hospitals.' I suggest that that is a Band-Aid type of an approach which we have tried time and time again. When we get into these great arguments about cutting or increasing Medicare, truly we aren't fixing anything. We are just tinkering around the edges. We need some fundamental reform and change. If we continue to just reduce the amount we give to doctors and to the hospitals pretty soon doctors and hospitals are going to say, `Wait a minute. I am not going to treat Medicare patients anymore. You are giving me less than it is costing me to provide these wonderful services that are important to seniors in this country. So I quit. I am out of here.' You are seeing that happen around the country. Unfortunately, the proposals we have on the board so far this year are simply just the same old same old--simply reducing the amount we pay doctors and hospitals. I think we have to do something more fundamental than that. 
What I am suggesting is that we restructure Medicare by modeling it on what we have as Senators, what we have as Members of Congress, and what 9 million Federal employees have for their health care package of benefits. I think most people believe that if Congress wrote a plan for themselves it must be pretty good. They are right. It is pretty good. It is much better than what seniors have under the current Medicare plan. I am suggesting that we take the Medicare plan and give people who are on Medicare--the beneficiary--at least the option of having the same benefits that their Senator or their Congressman, or the rest of the Federal work force has which is the Federal employee health benefit plan. With our plan the Federal Government finances about 71 percent of the premium cost for the plan with the participants paying the other remaining 29 percent. We have the option of choosing a Cadillac plan for which we will pay a little bit more, or a less expensive plan that we pay a little bit less for, and the Government pays a little bit less. But you have the flexibility. It is sort of a combination of a defined contribution and benefit plan where the Federal Government says we want some people to offer us some option. It has to meet a minimum standard. And depending on which plan you pick determines how much you are going to have to 
pay for it. 
No. 1, the plan would give seniors a greater choice of health care plans than they currently have. It would give them better coverage than they currently have while at the same time curbing the growth in Medicare costs by creating what Medicare doesn't have, and that is real competition. 
The reason Medicare is increasing at twice the rate of private insurance is because there is no real competition among Medicare beneficiaries and the plan that they have. In the private sector, which is increasing about 4 percent or less, there is competition. They receive more. They pay less under Medicare. We get less and pay more. 
So I am suggesting that a plan based on the Federal employee health benefit plan would give more competition, more benefits, more information, and more choice to Medicare recipients than they have today. There would be more competition because the current Medicare system of price fixing by the Government here in Washington I think is a disaster. We have people in Washington that work very hard to try to fix prices. But it is not working. The costs are going up higher than the private plans and they are fixing the price. It is not working. So we are the only group that has lost money on managed care. 
Medicare now offers HMO's because it is under a price structure and price fixing. We are losing money on HMO's. Everybody else who is trying HMO's is saving money because there is competition. But under Medicare, when somebody gets in an HMO, we are still controlling the price. And the Government is losing money under HMO's because of price fixing, and everybody else is saving a substantial amount of money. 
So we have to change the way we are doing business, and to bring in more competition. The Federal Government OPM negotiates on behalf of 9 million employees. And there is a lot of competition because they can go to the market and say, `We are going to offer you 9 million workers, and we want you to bid on what health care you are going to provide them. And make sure it is a minimum standard, and see who offers the best deal.' We have 38 million people in the system. The potential for negotiating a good price is astronomically increased, and it makes much more sense. Right now we are relying on Medicare and arbitrary bureaucratic price regulations and price fixing. The private sector, which relies on competition, more information, and more flexibility, is working and the prices have not gone up. 
The second thing is we would get more benefits. When we talk to seniors, we say that we want to change it. But we want to give you more benefits than you have right now because what you have is a 1965 model that is like a Chevrolet that has never been repaired since 1965. It wouldn't run very well today. But we are giving them a 1965 model. It was great for a long period of time. But because of the change in the world it is not giving the benefits that the private sector gives other people. 
Medicare doesn't cover most outpatient prescription drugs. For instance, it doesn't cover generally dental care, or have any catastrophic limits on catastrophic health care and out-of-pocket contributions as private plans do. In fact, Medicare's benefit package is less generous than about 85 percent of private insurance and private sector plans. I think a lot of seniors think that they have a great plan when in truth it is less generous than 85 percent of the private sector health insurance plans. It is not that good of a plan by any stretch of the imagination. The program covers only about 45 percent of the total annual health care bill of the elderly. That is not a particularly good deal by any stretch, if your health care plan is only covering about 45 percent of your annual out-of-pocket expenses. That is what Medicare currently does with our seniors. 
The plan would also give them more information. They do not get a lot of information under Medicare. They get a card. They say, go to your doctor under a fee-for-service plan, but you do not get a lot of information about which doctors are the best, which hospitals are the best, which services are the most efficient and do the best job. To the contrary, with the Federal plan, every year they publish a guide with information on benefits and premiums. 
We can improve upon that. We should have a report card for all these plans so they can see how many people were treated, their success ratio, what the failure rate is, and how the plans are working. So we need to give them more information than they currently have. Medicare currently really gives seniors zero information on the quality of the plans under which they operate. That is not fair to the seniors, and it is not helpful to the system at large. 
Then it gives them more choice. The 9 million Federal employees nationwide have the benefit of looking at about 388 different health insurance plans to see which one that they would like that fits their needs--388 different plans that they can take a look at and say, `This one is better' or `this one.' That is nationwide. Most of us in Washington look at two or three or four, maybe five different plans and say, `This one fits my family; I will take this high option,' or `I will take the low-option or standard plan.' It is an easy choice with a lot of information, and, most importantly, it has information that is needed to make the correct choice. 
All of these plans under Medicare simply continue to rely on the very inefficient Federal price fixing as opposed to how much the market is charging. We have bureaucrats who are trying to do a wonderful job. I do not criticize them. But it is impossible to do what they are attempting to do to make sure we have a better system. 
Mr. President and my colleagues, I will be talking more about this. We are still working on the details. But I suggest we need to be looking at, fundamentally, restructuring Medicare to make it a better program for the seniors than they are now getting and at a price we can afford. Doing nothing is not an option, because then we destroy the system that has taken care of the needs of seniors for over 30 years in this country. 
We in Congress have an obligation to fix it and to be able to help educate the seniors that what they have now is not a good deal, it is not as good as most private plans, and we can offer them more choice and more benefits, better information, and do it in a way that allows the marketplace to determine the price. 
The Office of Personnel Management looks at the top six health plans in the country and comes up with an average price and negotiates based on that average price. It is not Washington fixing prices but the market. When we have that large of a pool of individuals, then you can have the competition that is necessary to get the price down. So what the private sector is getting is a lot more choice, more benefits, and the price is increasing only at about 4 percent a year or less while Medicare has less of everything and the price is increasing at about 8.6 percent a year. 
So we are going to be talking more about the details. We do not have all the details yet, but this is a concept that I think makes sense. My proposal will allow the current fee-for-service system to stay in place. If they wish to keep the whole system, they would have the option to do that. But I guarantee you, as more and more people understand what this plan will offer them, I think very few will elect to go back to a 1965 model when they have the opportunity to select a 1997 model which makes sense and gives them a great many more benefits. 
Mr. President, I conclude my remarks by saying we will continue to talk about this, to help educate our colleagues about what we are attempting to do. Others have come up with this plan. We have had groups like the Progressive Policy Institute that has suggested this. The Brookings Institution has suggested this type of approach. The Heritage Foundation has suggested this type of approach. We have liberals, conservatives, and moderates saying we have to fundamentally make some changes. This is the way to go. This is the right approach. I agree with them. I think as we know more about it, more and more of our colleagues will agree with this approach as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I join with several of my colleagues to introduce the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997. 
Tax policy should meet two criteria. It should provide an effective and efficient way to collect taxes for the operation of our Government and it should encourage positive economic and social policies. This tax does neither. After looking at the current system, I have concluded that Federal estate and gift taxes are not worth the cost to our economy, to businesses and to American families. 
In 1995, the estate tax generated $14.8 billion in revenue, only 1.09 percent of total Federal revenues. Conversely, the cost of collecting and enforcing the estate tax to the Government and taxpayers was 65 cents of every dollar collected. 
The effects of the estate tax are felt most by family-owned businesses. More than 70 percent of family-owned businesses do not survive the second generation and 87 percent do not survive the third generation. Many families are forced to liquefy their businesses in order to pay the estate tax. 
There is a definite need to remedy these problem and this bill takes steps in the right direction. The legislation would increase the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million, and allow estate tax-free transfers of certain qualified small business assets. 
I hope that any tax bill we put forth this year will include estate tax relief based on the principles we have put forth in this bill.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce the `Distilled Spirits Tax Payment Simplification Act of 1997,' a bill more readily known as All-In-Bond. This bill would streamline the way in which the Government collects Federal excise tax on distilled spirits by extending the current system of collection now applicable only to imported products to domestic products as well. 
Today wholesalers purchase foreign-bottled distilled spirits in bond--tax free--paying the Federal excise tax directly after sale to a retailer. In contrast, when the wholesaler buys domestically bottled spirits--nearly 86 percent of total inventory--the price includes the Federal excise tax, prepaid by the distiller. This means that hundreds of U.S. family-owned wholesale businesses increase their inventory carrying costs by 40 percent when buying U.S. products, which often have to be financed through borrowing. 
Under my bill, wholesalers would be allowed to purchase domestically bottled distilled spirits in bond from distillers just as they are now permitted to purchase foreign-produced spirits. Products would become subject to tax on removal from wholesale premises. This legislation is designed to be revenue neutral and includes the requirement that any wholesaler electing to purchase spirits in bond must make certain estimated tax payments to Treasury before the end of the fiscal year. 
All-In-Bond is an equitable and sound way to streamline our tax collection system. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, next week working men and women from all over Louisiana will pause to honor a great and visionary leader and a remarkable man who has led Louisiana's AFL-CIO for the past 41 years. On March 10, my good friend Victor Bussie will retire as president of my State's AFL-CIO--marking the end of a truly historic public career during which time he was widely regarded as one of the most powerful and respected men in Louisiana public life. 
Those of us who have known and admired Vic Bussie for many years understand that his power was not so much derived from the position he held, but from the force of his personality and the deep conviction and personal integrity that he brought to every debate or endeavor. Simply put, Vic Bussie will always be remembered as one of the most honorable and decent men who ever served in public life. 
Perhaps the greatest testimony to Vic Bussie's extraordinary career is the many tributes paid to him by those who often found themselves on opposing sides in legislative and political battles. Almost without exception, those who fought with Vic Bussie over the issues never had anything but the highest regard for his integrity and his tireless dedication to the cause of Louisiana's working men and women. Always aided by his wife, Fran, Vic Bussie was not only an effective and articulate spokesman for organized labor; he also brought his influence and moral persuasion to bear on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, education, health care, government reform and economic development. In every case, I believe that the people of Louisiana are better off today because Vic Bussie took an interest in those issues and dedicated himself to making life better for all of our citizens, not just those in the labor movement. 
Perhaps one of the greatest testimonies to Vic Bussie's influence and power were the many national political leaders who relied on him during his 41 years at the helm of Louisiana's AFL-CIO. From John F. Kennedy to Lyndon Johnson to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton, presidents of the United States have often sought Vic Bussie's counsel and have relied on him to build public support for their campaigns and their legislative initiatives. In the mid-1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson was attempting to persuade my predecessor, Senator Russell Long, to support his proposal to create the national Medicare system, he called on Vic Bussie. As the story goes, Vic was on the next plane to Washington and it was not long afterwards that Senator Long announced his support for Medicare. As Russell and I have learned so many times, it is awfully hard to say no to Vic Bussie. 
Mr. President, the late Adlai Stevenson once remarked that `every age needs men who will redeem the time by living with a vision of things that are to be.' I suspect that Vic counted Adlai Stevenson as one of his friends. In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that Stevenson had Vic Bussie in mind when he uttered those words. As leader of Louisiana's labor movement for the past 41 years, Vic Bussie has certainly redeemed his time well. All working men and women owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude and my wife, Lois, and I are very proud to be part of the chorus of well-deserved praise that is coming his way during the days leading up to his retirement. 
I know I speak for many others when I say that Victor Bussie will always be gratefully remembered for the outstanding service he has rendered to his State and his Nation.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last year I was shocked to learn of the huge difference that exists between the Federal penalties for trafficking powder cocaine and for trafficking the exact same amount of crack cocaine. 
Right now, selling five grams of crack cocaine results in the same 5-year mandatory minimum prison term as selling 500 grams of powder cocaine. Selling 50 grams of crack cocaine gets you a 10-year minimum sentence, while you'd have to sell 5,000 grams of powder cocaine to get the same 10 years in prison. 
While these penalties are vastly different--100 times greater if you sell crack cocaine--the damage caused by these criminal acts are the same. Lives are lost, families are destroyed, careers are ruined, and our Nation itself is seriously threatened. 
Tough penalties are necessary to send a clear signal that the United States will not tolerate selling illegal drugs. The answer to the problem presented by this wide difference in penalties is not to lower penalties for selling crack cocaine but to increase the penalties for selling powder cocaine. 
Therefore, my legislation is very simple and very clear. Trafficking--that is the manufacture, distribution, or sale--of 50 grams of powder cocaine will result in a 10-year minimum sentence--the same as dealing in crack cocaine. 
Manufacture, distribution or sale of 5 grams of powder cocaine will result in a 5-year minimum sentence--the same as dealing in crack cocaine. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass a bill that deters the use of all cocaine--powder and crack.

 Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, on January 24, 1997, after 36 years of service, Dr. H. Rouse Caffey will retire from Louisiana State University, completing a career of notable accomplishments and a tenure of extraordinary leadership and service. 
It is most appropriate, therefore, on the occasion of his retirement that the State will proclaim, January 24, 1997, as H. Rouse Caffey Day in Louisiana, a tribute of which he is most deserving. 
For about 30 of those 36 years, I've known Dr. Caffey personally. I've worked closely with him on many occasions. I will miss him, as will many others who've had the privilege to work with him. 
Distinguished leadership and service have been the hallmarks of Dr. Caffey's career, including his most recent role as chancellor of the LSU Agricultural Center, a position which he has held for 13 years. 
His genuine devotion to the LSU Agricultural Center and the people of Louisiana has kept farmers, families, and youth knowledgeable about the most recent information available to help improve their lives. 
Dr. Caffey's service to this country as national cochair of the International Science and Education Council from 1986 to 1991 and as national cochair of the Joint Council for Food and Agricultural Sciences from 1989 to 1995, earned him the respect and admiration of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and land grant institutions across the Nation. 
In addition, Dr. Caffey's international agricultural activities in 30 foreign countries have earned for him, for LSU, for Louisiana, and for the Nation the respect and admiration of leaders abroad and have led to improved and lasting relationships with them. 
His other LSU appointments have included superintendent of the LSU Rice Research Station at Crowley, LA; associate director of the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station in Baton Rouge; vice chancellor for administration of the Center for Agricultural Sciences and Rural Development; director of International Programs; and chancellor of LSU at Alexandria. 
Throughout Dr. Caffey's career, he has received numerous awards and honors, including the 1993 LSU Alumni Association Alumnus of the year; 1994 Alumnus of the Year for the College of Agriculture and Home Economics at Mississippi State University; and Progressive Farmer magazine's 1986 Man of the Year for Louisiana Agriculture. 
Dr. Caffey's personality, dedication, knowledge, service, and leadership have left a unique and lasting impression on LSU, its agricultural center, and the agricultural community nationally and internationally. 
Dr. Caffey will always have my respect and admiration, sentiments which are shared, I know, by the many individuals and organizations led and served so well by him over the years. 
In closing, Mr. President, I take this occasion to commend Dr. Caffey personally for his lifetime of distinguished leadership and service and to wish him every continued success in the future.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today Senator Roth and I are introducing the Savings and Investment Incentive Act of 1997. We have introduced this bill in past Congresses but it is even more timely now as the pressure builds to secure the retirement of the baby boomers. 
The facts are staring us in the face. Within 30 years one out of every five Americans will be over 65. The baby boomers are 76 million strong, doubling the number of Social Security beneficiaries by the year 2040. 
At the same time, Social Security outlays will begin out pacing Social Security receipts in 2013 and the Social Security trust fund will be bankrupt in 2029 if we don't take the necessary steps to preserve it. And our national savings rate is only 1 percent of GDP. This is one-half of what it was in 1970. By comparison, we save half as much as the Germans and one-third as much as the Japanese. This is a serious problem. We need to address it by reducing the budget deficit and eliminating the drain it places on our national savings but we need to address it in other ways, as well. 
The Super IRA bill makes changes in the rules governing IRA's that will expand the availability of the IRA as a savings vehicle. The income caps will be eliminated over a 5-year period. Our bill creates a new kind of IRA that allows taxpayers to earn tax-free income. Funds can be withdrawn from either the current form of IRA or the new IRA to purchase a first home, meet a family's income needs during an extended period of unemployment or to pay for educational expenses. 
IRA's have broad bipartisan support as demonstrated by the list of cosponsors. I hope that we will work together to pass this legislation this year.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about S. 12, the Education for the 21st Century Act, and our efforts to improve elementary and secondary educational opportunities for our Nation's children, as well as make higher education more accessible for adults. 
Quality education is necessary not only for the future of our children and our families, but for the future of our Nation. A better educated workforce is essential to compete in the global economy and to maintain a strong democracy. Every Member of this body knows that a high school diploma is worth far less in today's marketplace than a generation ago. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 60 percent of all jobs created between 1992 and 2005 will require education beyond high school. Modern society has little room for those who cannot read, write, and compute effectively; solve problems; and continually learn new technologies and skills. 
The Education for the 21st Century Act includes a number of important initiatives that, if enacted, will make educational opportunities more accessible for Americans: The HOPE Scholarship, the tax deduction for higher education expenses, the student loan interest deduction, and the technology literacy and America Reads initiatives. Another area of concern that S. 12 addresses is the declining physical condition of our Nation's schools. 
According to a June 1996 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, nationwide, about a third of public elementary and secondary schools have at least one building needing extensive repair, and about 60 percent need extensive repair, overhaul, or replacement of at least one major building feature. Nationwide, about 58 percent of schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition (i.e., lighting, heating, ventilation, indoor air quality, acoustics for noise control, and physical security). Nationwide, 21 percent of schools need to spend over the national average ($1.7 million) to bring their facilities into `good condition.' 
Although a national problem, it is mirrored in every State. In my own State of Louisiana, about 38 percent of public elementary and secondary schools have at least one building needing extensive repair. Fifty-six percent of Louisiana schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. Twenty-three percent of Louisiana schools need to spend over the national average to bring their facilities into `good condition.' Sixty-five percent of Louisiana schools lack telephone lines for computer modems. 
It is important that we help schools, libraries, and local governments bring advanced telecommunications to millions who otherwise cannot participate in the new information age. Computer services like the Internet give young people in the most poor and remote communities access to the same information available in the best libraries and institutions in the country and the world. Unfortunately, many States and local governments have had to cut back on investment in education because of budget problems and limits on debt capacity. 
Some have argued that the proper role of Government is to try to solve everyone's problems from cradle to grave--to create programs to protect citizens from everything, even themselves, because, as they say, `Government knows best.' Others argue that Government has no role at all in helping people, other than getting out of the way and offer only a survival of the fittest solution. My colleagues let me suggest that the better role for Government to play is one that equips the American people with the means to solve their own problems. 
Some want to abandon the public schools, not make them better--as if removing the most motivated students and parents will somehow increase the drive to improve schools for everyone else. Others say education reform is a question of more resources and better management. Still others say an education system for the 21st century should be defined by its results and schools exist only if they attract students and satisfy parents; they serve everyone; and they operate on the premise that all students can succeed. 
Whatever your point of view, the task of making education work falls to all of us. If we have learned anything over the past decades, it is there is no quick fix. This proposal will not transform our schools overnight. However, over time, it will be a meaningful step toward improving the lives and futures of families in Louisiana and throughout this Nation. I believe we should explore, and I am exploring, other ideas and options to help State and local governments address their infrastructure needs. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will favorably consider this legislation. As we move through the 105th Congress and consider all of the various proposals to produce a balanced federal budget, we must be mindful that our intent is to provide, not deny, American families the means and the opportunity to take part in our global economy.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Children's Health Coverage Act of 1997, a bill designed to expand health insurance for an estimated 10 million American children who have no health insurance. Last year, when Congress passed the Kassebaum/Kennedy bill, it took a big step towards increasing the availability of private health insurance coverage for certain children. While the Kassebaum/Kennedy legislation will increase access to the health insurance market for many people, there are still too many low-income working families in this country who are unable to afford coverage even though it may be more readily available to them. 
According to a 1994 GAO report, 14.2 percent of all children are uninsured, the highest rate in any industrialized country. In Louisiana alone there are 254,952 children without health insurance. Nine out of ten of these children live in families with working parents. These parents go to work every day to earn a living and provide for their families. Some might say that providing for one's family should include health insurance but when you've got food to buy and rent to pay, health insurance to many parents is an unaffordable luxury. Perhaps even more troubling is that the number of uninsured children is expected to grow as employers continue to cut back on dependant coverage, leaving many working parents unable to afford insurance for their families. While Medicaid has picked up some of these children and will continue to do so, these expansions won't be enough to completely offset the loss in private coverage in this country. 
Mr. President, an important lesson we have learned in recent years is that big government mandates won't work. But I believe expanding coverage of children is a necessary next step to follow up on the significant progress we made last year. We should build on the momentum from Kassebaum/Kennedy bill to help low-income working families buy health insurance they need for their children. Basic primary and preventive care services that insurance provides are critical to a child's healthy development, and like all kinds of preventive care, it's cheaper than treating a child once he or she gets sick. As we all know, uninsured children are more likely to get care in an emergency room at later stages in their illness and are more likely to require an expensive hospital stay. 
This bill is a market-based plan that will provide tax credits to help working families buy the health insurance they need. Our goal is to stimulate a competitive market for children's health plans which are relatively inexpensive but have a big economic payoff. I am hopeful that Democrats and Republicans will be able to work together on this issue because it's in everyone's interest that our nation's children have the health care and health insurance they need since they are the future of this country. For the future of a healthy America, we need healthy kids now.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this Democratic leadership bill--the youth violence, crime, and drug abuse bill. 
Crime ranks among the highest concerns of all Americans, no matter what their race or social background. Louisiana is no exception. In a recent poll, 86 percent of Louisianians said crime is a serious problem, ranking it as the No. 1 problem in our State. The city of New Orleans is experiencing a murder rate that is eight times higher than the national average. People want us and their local governments and State governments to do something about this problem. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently released statistics showing that serious and violent crime dropped nationwide in the first half of last year. It is good news, certainly, that violent crime in this country has gone down; but the bad news is that juvenile crime is on the increase. Youth crimes, particularly homicides perpetrated with guns, have skyrocketed. The average cost of incarcerating a juvenile for just 1 year is somewhere between $23,000 and $64,000. I strongly support this Democratic legislation because it focuses directly on juveniles, punishes violent youthful offenders, and provides more access to treatment and prevention programs. 
We must continue the success of the COPS Program and put 25,000 more cops on the beat. We must create a new Federal crime targeting the interstate franchising spread of criminal street gangs and other changes aimed at gang violence, such as increasing the penalties for witness intimidation. We must extend the drug court program to force some 500,000 drug offenders to engage in rigorous drug testing and treatment, or face imprisonment and, finally, we must continue to provide funds to arrest and prosecute batterers and shelter 400,000 battered women. Mr. President, this bill includes all of these provisions, and I would urge my colleagues to support it. 
For the sake of generations to come, it is time that we attack crime with a renewed vigor. Today's juvenile criminal becomes tomorrow's adult criminal. We must pass this legislation.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Stevens and others, I am introducing legislation that will implement the Panama Declaration for the protection of dolphins in the tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The United States signed the Panama Declaration on October 4, 1995, along with the Governments of Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. by agreeing to the Panama Declaration, these countries have demonstrated their commitment to the conservation of ecosystems and the sustainable use of living resources related to the tuna fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific. 
By implementing the Panama Declaration, we will strengthen the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC], which has proven to be an extremely effective international resource management organization. Implementing the Panama Declaration will ensure the reduction of dolphin mortalities associated with tuna fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. In addition, we will enable American tuna fishermen to re-enter that tuna fishery on the same footing as foreign fishermen. 
Since 1949, the IATTC has served as the regional fishery management organization for the tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, managing that fishery in an exemplary manner. Managing migratory species requires a multilateral approach, one which the IATTC is well-suited to perform. The yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which the Panama Declaration addresses, falls under the auspices of the IATTC. In that fishery, tuna fishermen use dolphins to locate schools of large, mature yellowfin tuna which, for unknown reasons, associate with schools of dolphin. Once the schools of dolphin have been located, the fishermen use purse seine nets to encircle the dolphins with the objective of catching the tuna swimming below. The dolphins are then safely released before the tuna is hauled abroad. 
In recent years, there has been some concern about these fishing practices which, in the past, have resulted in excessive incidental mortality to dolphins. In 1992, in an effort to address this problem, 10 nations with tuna vessels operating in the eastern tropical Pacific signed an agreement known as the La Jolla Agreement. The La Jolla Agreement established the International Dolphin Conservation Program [IDCP], which is administered by the IATTC. 
The regional objective of the IDCP is to reduce dolphin mortalities to insignificant levels approaching zero, with a goal of eliminating them entirely. Pursuant to that program, the number of dolphins killed accidentally in the tuna fishery has been reduced to less than 4,000. 
annually from a previous average of over 300,000 killed annually. The current dolphin mortality represents approximately four one-hundredths of 1 percent of the 9.5 million dolphins of the eastern tropical Pacific. Thus, the IDCP has been remarkably successful in achieving its goal of reducing unintended dolphin mortalities to biologically insignificant levels approaching zero. 
This legislation will implement the Panama Declaration, formalize the 1992 La Jolla Agreement and make it a legal agreement binding on the member countries of the IATTC. The Panama Declaration strengthens the IDCP and furthers its goals by placing a cap of 5,000 per year on dolphin mortalities. 
Although U.S. fishermen developed the techniques now used in capturing tuna and safely releasing dolphins, they effectively have been forced from fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific since the 1992 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibit the encirclement of dolphins. The legislation to implement the Panama Declaration will eliminate the inequitable treatment of United States tuna fishermen and enable them to re-enter this important fishery on an equal footing with foreign fishermen. 
The 1992 ban on encirclement of dolphins has required fishermen to use alternative fishing practices which have serious environmental consequences. Alternative fishing practices lead to excessive bycatch of endangered sea turtles, sharks, billfish, and great numbers of immature tuna and other fish species. In an attempt to manage a single species, in this case dolphins, we have caused serious harm to the entire ecosystem. This legislation will result in a reduction of this bycatch problem as well as permit fishermen to encircle dolphins as long as they comply with the stringent regulations imposed by the IATTC. 
The purpose of this bill is to improve and solidify efforts to protect dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, eliminate the bycatch problems caused by alternative fishing methods, and recognize the tremendous gains by other countries in reducing dolphin mortality. The Panama Declaration establishes a common environmental standard for all countries fishing in the region. By formalizing the La Jolla Agreement, U.S. and foreign fishermen in the eastern tropical Pacific will be subject to the most stringent fishery regulations in the world. 
The Panama Declaration represents a tremendous environmental achievement, and it enjoys support from such diverse interests as major, mainstream environmental groups, the U.S. tuna fishing fleet, the Clinton administration, and other countries whose fishermen operate in the eastern tropical Pacific. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from Vice President Gore be entered into the Record. 
I am encouraged that the majority leader, on the Senate floor on September 30, 1996, had promised to provide floor time at the beginning of this Congress to vote on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation in order that we may implement this important international agreement.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that will correct a serious inequity in Louisiana's judicial districts. 
My legislation adds an additional judge to the middle district of Louisiana, based in Baton Rouge. U.S. District Judges John Parker and Frank Polozola, the two Baton Rouge, judges, each have almost 2,000 cased pending. The national average for federal judges is 400 cased pending. Case filings in the Middle District have totaled more than four times the national average. The Baton Rouge district also ranks first among the Nation's 97 federal court districts in total filings, civil filings, weighted filings and in the percent change in total filings last year. 
Louisiana's Middle District is composed of nine parishes. The state capital and many of the State's adult and juvenile prisons and forensic facilities are located in this district. The Court is regularly required to hear most of the litigation challenging the constitutionality of State laws and the actions of State agencies and officials. The District now has several reapportionment and election cases pending on the docket which generally require the immediate attention of the court. Additionally, because numerous chemical, oil, and industrial plants and hazardous waste sites are located in the Middle District, the Court has in the past and will continue to handle complex mass tort cases. One environmental case alone, involving over 7,000 plaintiffs and numerous defendants, is being handled by a judge from another district because both of the Middle District's judges were recused. 
Since 1984, the Middle District has sought an additional judge because of its concern that its caseload would continue to rise despite the fact that its judges' termination rate exceeded that national average and ranked among the highest in numerical standing within the United States and the Fifth Circuit. Both the Judicial Conference and the Judicial Council of the Fifth Circuit have approved the Middle District's request for an additional judgeship after each biennial survey from 1984 through 1994. 
Mr. President, I know that my colleagues will agree with me that the clear solution to this obvious inequity is to assign an additional judge to Louisiana's Middle District. I look forward to the Senate's resolution of this important matter.

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death from diseases in the United States. Deaths accountable to diabetes or resulting complications number about 250,000 per year. Diabetes also results in about 12,000 new cases of blindness each year and greatly increases an individual's chance of heart disease, kidney failure, and stroke. 
The terrible irony, Mr. President, is that diabetes is largely a treatable condition. While there is no known cure, individuals who have diabetes can lead completely normal, active lives so long as they stick to a proper diet, carefully monitor the amount of sugar in their blood, and take their medicine, which may or may not include insulin. In order to take proper care of themselves, diabetics need to take self-maintenance education programs--at least once when they are diagnosed with the disease and then periodically after that to keep up with the latest treatments and any changes in their own condition. 
Appropriate preventive education services for diabetics have the potential to save a great deal of money that would otherwise go for hospitalizations and other acute care costs--not to mention a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering. CBO projects that this proposal would save Medicare money in the long-run. 
Medicare currently covers diabetes self-maintenance education services in inpatient or hospital-based settings and in limited outpatient settings, specifically hospital outpatient departments or rural health clinics. Medicare does not cover education services if they are given in any other outpatient setting, such as a doctor's office. Even the limited coverage of outpatient settings that is currently permitted under Medicare is subject to State-by-State variation according to fiscal intermediaries' interpretation. 
Medicare also covers the cost of the paper test strips that are used to monitor the sugar levels in the blood--but only for diabetics who require insulin to control their disease. All noninsulin dependent diabetics must purchase these test strips at their own expense. 
Today, I am introducing the Medicare Diabetes Education and Supplies Amendments of 1997. This legislation would provide Medicare coverage for outpatient education on a consistent equitable basis throughout the country. The bill would extend Medicare coverage of outpatient programs beyond hospital-based programs and rural health clinics and direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to do two things: First, to develop and implement payment amounts for outpatient diabetes education programs; and second, to adopt quality standards for outpatient education programs. Only qualified programs would be eligible to receive Medicare reimbursement. Furthermore, this legislation would mandate test strip coverage for all diabetics. 
This preventive measure is a sensible one that will show savings for the Medicare Program in the long run. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage this Congress.
